BACKGROUND: Heart failure (HF) combined with hypertension is an extremely 
important cause of in-hospital mortality, especially for the intensive care unit 
(ICU) patients. However, under intense working pressure, the medical staff are 
easily overwhelmed by the large number of clinical signals generated in the ICU, 
which may lead to treatment delay, sub-optimal care, or even wrong clinical 
decisions. Individual risk stratification is an essential strategy for managing 
ICU patients with HF combined with hypertension. Artificial intelligence, 
especially machine learning (ML), can develop superior models to predict the 
prognosis of these patients. This study aimed to develop a machine learning 
method to predict the 28-day mortality for ICU patients with HF combined with 
hypertension.
METHODS: We enrolled all critically ill patients with HF combined with 
hypertension in the Medical Information Mart for IntensiveCare Database-IV 
(MIMIC-IV, v.1.4) and the eICU Collaborative Research Database (eICU-CRD) from 
2008 to 2019. Subsequently, MIMIC-IV was divided into training cohort and 
testing cohort in an 8:2 ratio, and eICU-CRD was designated as the external 
validation cohort. The least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) 
Cox regression with internal tenfold cross-validation was used for data 
dimension reduction and identifying the most valuable predictive features for 
28-day mortality. Based on its accuracy and area under the curve (AUC), the best 
model in the validation cohort was selected. In addition, we utilized the 
Shapley Additive Explanations (SHAP) method to highlight the importance of model 
features, analyze the impact of individual features on model output, and 
visualize an individual's Shapley values.
RESULTS: A total of 3,458 and 6582 patients with HF combined with hypertension 
in MIMIC-IV and eICU-CRD were included. The patients, including 1,756 males, had 
a median (Q1, Q3) age of 75 (65, 84) years. After selection, 22 out of a total 
of 58 clinical parameters were extracted to develop the machine-learning models. 
Among four constructed models, the Neural Networks (NN) model performed the best 
predictive performance with an AUC of 0.764 and 0.674 in the test cohort and 
external validation cohort, respectively. In addition, a simplified model 
including seven variables was built based on NN, which also had good predictive 
performance (AUC: 0.741). Feature importance analysis showed that age, 
mechanical ventilation (MECHVENT), chloride, bun, anion gap, paraplegia, rdw 
(RDW), hyperlipidemia, peripheral capillary oxygen saturation (SpO2), 
respiratory rate, cerebrovascular disease, heart rate, white blood cell (WBC), 
international normalized ratio (INR), mean corpuscular hemoglobin concentration 
(MCHC), glucose, AIDS, mean corpuscular volume (MCV), N-terminal pro-brain 
natriuretic peptide (Npro. BNP), calcium, renal replacement therapy (RRT), and 
partial thromboplastin time (PTT) were the top 22 features of the NN model with 
the greatest impact. Finally, after hyperparameter optimization, SHAP plots were 
employed to make the NN-based model interpretable with an analytical description 
of how the constructed model visualizes the prediction of death.
CONCLUSION: We developed a predictive model to predict the 28-day mortality for 
ICU patients with HF combined with hypertension, which proved superior to the 
traditional logistic regression analysis. The SHAP method enables machine 
learning models to be more interpretable, thereby helping clinicians to better 
understand the reasoning behind the outcome and assess in-hospital outcomes for 
critically ill patients.

Intensive care unit (ICU)-acquired infection is a common cause of poor prognosis 
of sepsis in the ICU. However, sepsis-associated ICU-acquired infections have 
not been fully characterized. The study aims to assess the risk factors and 
develop a model that predicts the risk of ICU-acquired infections in patients 
with sepsis.
METHODS: We retrieved data from the Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care 
(MIMIC) IV database. Patients were randomly divided into training and validation 
cohorts at a 7:3 ratio. A multivariable logistic regression model was used to 
identify independent risk factors that could predict ICU-acquired infection. We 
also assessed its discrimination and calibration abilities and compared them 
with classical score systems.
RESULTS: Of 16,808 included septic patients, 2,871 (17.1%) developed 
ICU-acquired infection. These patients with ICU-acquired infection had a 17.7% 
ICU mortality and 31.8% in-hospital mortality and showed a continued rise in 
mortality from 28 to 100 days after ICU admission. The classical Systemic 
Inflammatory Response Syndrome Score (SIRS), Sequential Organ Failure Assessment 
(SOFA), Oxford Acute Severity of Illness Score (OASIS), Simplified Acute 
Physiology Score II (SAPS II), Logistic Organ Dysfunction Score (LODS), Charlson 
Comorbidity Index (CCI), and Acute Physiology Score III (APS III) scores were 
associated with ICU-acquired infection, and cerebrovascular insufficiency, 
Gram-negative bacteria, surgical ICU, tracheostomy, central venous catheter, 
urinary catheter, mechanical ventilation, red blood cell (RBC) transfusion, LODS 
score and anticoagulant therapy were independent predictors of developing 
ICU-acquired infection in septic patients. The nomogram on the basis of these 
independent predictors showed good calibration and discrimination in both the 
derivation (AUROC = 0.737; 95% CI, 0.725-0.749) and validation (AUROC = 0.751; 
95% CI, 0.734-0.769) populations and was superior to that of SIRS, SOFA, OASIS, 
SAPS II, LODS, CCI, and APS III models.
CONCLUSIONS: ICU-acquired infections increase the likelihood of septic 
mortality. The individualized prognostic model on the basis of the nomogram 
could accurately predict ICU-acquired infection and optimize management or 
tailored therapy.

BACKGROUND: Platelets play a critical role in hemostasis and inflammatory 
diseases. Low platelet count and activity have been reported to be associated 
with unfavorable prognosis. This study aims to explore the relationship between 
dynamics in platelet count and in-hospital morality among septic patients and to 
provide real-time updates on mortality risk to achieve dynamic prediction.
METHODS: We conducted a multi-cohort, retrospective, observational study that 
encompasses data on septic patients in the eICU Collaborative Research Database 
(eICU-CRD) and the Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care IV (MIMIC-IV) 
database. The joint latent class model (JLCM) was utilized to identify 
heterogenous platelet count trajectories over time among septic patients. We 
assessed the association between different trajectory patterns and 28-day 
in-hospital mortality using a piecewise Cox hazard model within each trajectory. 
We evaluated the performance of our dynamic prediction model through area under 
the receiver operating characteristic curve, concordance index (C-index), 
accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity calculated at predefined time points.
RESULTS: Four subgroups of platelet count trajectories were identified that 
correspond to distinct in-hospital mortality risk. Including platelet count did 
not significantly enhance prediction accuracy at early stages (day 1 
C-indexDynamic  vs C-indexWeibull: 0.713 vs 0.714). However, our model showed 
superior performance to the static survival model over time (day 14 
C-indexDynamic  vs C-indexWeibull: 0.644 vs 0.617).
CONCLUSIONS: For septic patients in an intensive care unit, the rapid decline in 
platelet counts is a critical prognostic factor, and serial platelet measures 
are associated with prognosis.

BACKGROUND: New-onset atrial fibrillation (NOAF) is the most common arrhythmia 
in critically ill patients admitted to intensive care and is associated with 
poor prognosis and disease burden. Identifying high-risk individuals early is 
crucial. This study aims to create and validate a NOAF prediction model for 
critically ill patients using machine learning (ML).
METHODS: The data came from two non-overlapping datasets from the Medical 
Information Mart for Intensive Care (MIMIC), with MIMIC-IV used for training and 
subset of MIMIC-III used as external validation. LASSO regression was used for 
feature selection. Eight ML algorithms were employed to construct the prediction 
model. Model performance was evaluated based on identification, calibration, and 
clinical application. The SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) method was used 
for visualizing model characteristics and individual case predictions.
RESULTS: Among 16,528 MIMIC-IV patients, 1520 (9.2%) developed AF post-ICU 
admission. A model with 23 variables was built, with XGBoost performing best, 
achieving an AUC of 0.891 (0.873-0.888) in validation and 0.769 (0.756-0.782) in 
external validation. Key predictors included age, mechanical ventilation, urine 
output, sepsis, blood urea nitrogen, percutaneous arterial oxygen saturation, 
continuous renal replacement therapy and weight. A risk probability greater than 
0.6 was defined as high risk. A friendly user interface had been developed for 
clinician use.
CONCLUSION: We developed a ML model to predict the risk of NOAF in critically 
ill patients without cardiac surgery and validated its potential as a clinically 
reliable tool. SHAP improves the interpretability of the model, enables 
clinicians to better understand the causes of NOAF, helps clinicians to prevent 
it in advance and improves patient outcomes.

BACKGROUND: The lymphocyte-to-high-density lipoprotein (HDL) ratio (LHR) is 
associated with both inflammation and immunity, and may have the potential to 
predict the prognosis of sepsis. Our study aimed to evaluate the relationship 
between LHR and sepsis-related mortality.
METHODS: We collected data from the Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care 
IV (MIMIC-IV, version 2.2) database by targeting patients who met the Sepsis-3 
criteria and recorded the absolute values of lymphocytes and HDL after 
admission. We then used restricted cubic splines based on logistic regression to 
simulate the relationship between the LHR and 90-day mortality. Subsequently, 
the hazardous threshold was derived based on the mortality curve, and further 
evaluations were performed using different methods and data sources for 
hazardous threshold.
RESULTS: We ultimately included 1027 eligible patients from the MIMIC-IV 
database and described the nonlinear relationship between LHR and 90-day 
mortality. Based on the curve, an LHR of ≤ 0.6 indicated harmful threshold, and 
the odds ratio for mortality was 1.74 (P=0.001). The outperforming hazard was 
particularly marked in patients with chronic lung disease and remained 
consistent after adjusting for baseline data and validating multiple data 
sources.
CONCLUSIONS: The LHR has prognostic value in patients with sepsis, and an LHR ≤ 
0.6 is a deleterious load that increases mortality.

BACKGROUND: Elderly patients with sepsis have many comorbidities, and the 
clinical reaction is not obvious. Thus, clinical treatment is difficult. We 
planned to use the laboratory test results and comorbidities of elderly patients 
with sepsis from a large-scale public database Medical Information Mart for 
Intensive Care (MIMIC) IV to build a random survival forest (RSF) model and to 
evaluate the model's predictive value for these patients.
METHODS: Clinical information of elderly patients with sepsis in MIMIC IV 
database was collected retrospectively. Machine learning (RSF) was used to 
select the top 30 variables in the training cohort to build the final RSF model. 
The model was compared with the traditional scoring systems SOFA, SAPSII, and 
APSIII. The performance of the model was evaluated by C index and calibration 
curve.
RESULTS: A total of 6,503 patients were enrolled in the study. The top 30 
important variables screened by RSF were used to construct the final RSF model. 
The new model provided a better C-index (0.731 in the validation cohort). The 
calibration curve described the agreement between the predicted probability of 
RSF model and the observed 30-day survival.
CONCLUSIONS: We constructed a prognostic model to predict a 30-day mortality 
risk in elderly patients with sepsis based on machine learning (RSF algorithm), 
and it proved superior to the traditional scoring systems. The risk factors 
affecting the patients were also ranked. In addition to the common risk factors 
of vasopressors, ventilator use, and urine output. Newly added factors such as 
RDW, type of ICU unit, malignant cancer, and metastatic solid tumor also 
significantly influence prognosis.

BACKGROUND: Cholelithiasis-induced acute cholangitis (CIAC) is an acute 
inflammatory disease with poor prognosis. This study aimed to create 
machine-learning (ML) models to predict the outcomes of patients with CIAC.
METHODS: In this retrospective cohort and ML study, patients who met the both 
diagnosis of 'cholangitis' and 'calculus of gallbladder or bile duct' according 
to the International Classification of Disease (ICD) 9th revision, or met the 
diagnosis of 'calculus of bile duct with acute cholangitis with or without 
obstruction' according to the ICD 10th revision during a single hospitalization 
were included from the Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care database, 
which records patient admissions to Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center, MA, 
USA, spanning June 1, 2001 to November 16, 2022. Patients who were neither 
admitted in an emergency department nor underwent biliary drainage within 24 h 
after admission, had an age of less than 18, or lost over 20% of the information 
were excluded. Nine ML methods, including the Logistic Regression, eXtreme 
Gradient Boosting (XGBoost), Light Gradient Boosting Machine, Adaptive Boosting, 
Decision Tree, Gradient Boosting Decision Tree, Gaussian Naive Bayes, 
Multi-Layer Perceptron, and Support Vector Machine were applied for prediction 
of in-hospital mortality, re-admission within 30 days after discharge, and 
mortality within 180 days after discharge. Patients from Zhongda Hospital 
affiliated to Southeast University in China between January 1, 2019 and July 30, 
2023 were enrolled as an external validation set. The area under the receiver 
operating characteristic curve (AUROC) was the main index for model performance 
assessment.
FINDINGS: A total of 1156 patients were included to construct models. We 
performed stratified analyses on all patients, patients admitted to the 
intensive care unit (ICU) and those who underwent biliary drainage during ICU 
treatment. 13-16 features were selected from 186 variables for model training. 
The XGBoost method demonstrated the most optimal predictive efficacy, as 
evidenced by training set AUROC of 0.996 (95% CI NaN-NaN) for in-hospital 
mortality, 0.886 (0.862-0.910) for re-admission within 30 days after discharge, 
and 0.988 (0.982-0.995) for mortality within 180 days after discharge in all 
patients, 0.998 (NaN-NaN), 0.933 (0.909-0.957), and 0.988 (0.983-0.993) in 
patients admitted to the ICU, 0.987 (0.970-0.999), 0.908 (0.873-0.942), and 
0.982 (0.971-0.993) in patients underwent biliary drainage during ICU treatment, 
respectively. Meanwhile, in the internal validation set, the AUROC reached 0.967 
(0.933-0.998) for in-hospital mortality, 0.589 (0.502-0.677) for re-admission 
within 30 days after discharge, and 0.857 (0.782-0.933) for mortality within 180 
days after discharge in all patients, 0.963 (NaN-NaN), 0.668 (0.486-0.851), and 
0.864 (0.757-0.970) in patients admitted to the ICU, 0.961 (0.922-0.997), 0.669 
(0.540-0.799), and 0.828 (0.730-0.925) in patients underwent biliary drainage 
during ICU treatment, respectively. The AUROC values of external validation set 
consisting of 61 patients were 0.741 (0.725-0.763), 0.812 (0.798-0.824), and 
0.848 (0.841-0.859), respectively.
INTERPRETATION: The XGBoost models could be promising tools to predict outcomes 
in patients with CIAC, and had good clinical applicability. Multi-center 
validation with a larger sample size is warranted.

BACKGROUND: The triglyceride-glucose (TyG) index, a tool for assessing insulin 
resistance, is increasingly recognized for its ability to predict cardiovascular 
and metabolic risks. However, its relationship with trauma and surgical patient 
prognosis is understudied. This study investigated the correlation between the 
TyG index and mortality risk in surgical/trauma ICU patients to identify 
high-risk individuals and improve prognostic strategies.
METHODS: This study identified patients requiring trauma/surgical ICU admission 
from the Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care (MIMIC-IV) database, and 
divided them into tertiles based on the TyG index. The outcomes included 28-day 
mortality and 180-day mortality for short-term and long-term prognosis. The 
associations between the TyG index and clinical outcomes in patients were 
elucidated using Cox proportional hazards regression analysis and RCS models.
RESULTS: A total of 2103 patients were enrolled. The 28-day mortality and 
180-day mortality rates reached 18% and 24%, respectively. Multivariate Cox 
proportional hazards analysis revealed that an elevated TyG index was 
significantly related to 28-day and 180-day mortality after covariates 
adjusting. An elevated TyG index was significantly associated with 28-day 
mortality (adjusted hazard ratio, 1.19; 95% confidence interval 1.04-1.37) and 
180-day mortality (adjusted hazard ratio, 1.24; 95% confidence interval 
1.11-1.39). RCS models revealed that a progressively increasing risk of 
mortality was related to an elevated TyG index. According to our subgroup 
analysis, an elevated TyG index is associated with increased risk of 28-day and 
180-day mortality in critically ill patients younger than 60 years old, as well 
as those with concomitant stroke or cardiovascular diseases. Additionally, in 
nondiabetic patients, an elevated TyG index is associated with 180-day 
mortality.
CONCLUSION: An increasing risk of mortality was related to an elevated TyG 
index. In critically ill patients younger than 60 years old, as well as those 
with concomitant stroke or cardiovascular diseases, an elevated TyG index is 
associated with adverse short-term and long-term outcomes. Furthermore, in 
non-diabetic patients, an elevated TyG index is associated with adverse 
long-term prognosis.

OBJECTIVE: To construct a nomogram based on the Sequential Organ Failure 
Assessment (SOFA) that is more accurate in predicting 30-, 60-, and 90-day 
mortality risk in patients with sepsis.
METHODS: Data from patients with sepsis were retrospectively collected from the 
Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care (MIMIC) database. Included patients 
were randomly divided into training and validation cohorts. Variables were 
selected using a backward stepwise selection method with Cox regression, then 
used to construct a prognostic nomogram. The nomogram was compared with the SOFA 
model using the concordance index (C-index), area under the time-dependent 
receiver operating characteristics curve (AUC), net reclassification improvement 
(NRI), integrated discrimination improvement (IDI), calibration plotting, and 
decision-curve analysis (DCA).
RESULTS: A total of 5240 patients were included in the study. Patient's age, 
SOFA score, metastatic cancer, SpO2, lactate, body temperature, albumin, and red 
blood cell distribution width were included in the nomogram. The C-index, AUC, 
NRI, IDI, and DCA of the nomogram showed that it performs better than the SOFA 
alone.
CONCLUSION: A nomogram was established that performed better than the SOFA in 
predicting 30-, 60-, and 90-day mortality risk in patients with sepsis.

OBJECTIVES: This study aims to develop and validate a prediction model 
in-hospital mortality in critically ill patients with sepsis-associated acute 
kidney injury (SA-AKI) based on machine learning algorithms.
METHODS: Patients who met the criteria for inclusion were identified in the 
Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care-IV (MIMIC-IV) database and divided 
according to the validation (n = 2440) and development (n = 9756, 80%) queues. 
Ensemble stepwise feature selection method was used to screen for effective 
features. The prediction models of short-term mortality were developed by seven 
machine learning algorithms. Ten-fold cross-validation was used to verify the 
performance of the algorithm in the development queue. The area under the 
receiver operating characteristic curve (ROC-AUC) was used to evaluate the 
differentiation accuracy and performance of the prediction model in the 
validation queue. The best-performing model was interpreted by Shapley additive 
explanations (SHAP).
RESULTS: A total of 12,196 patients were enrolled in this study. Eleven 
variables were finally chosen to develop the prediction model. The AUC of the 
random forest (RF) model was the highest value both in the Ten-fold 
cross-validation and evaluation (AUC: 0.798, 95% CI: 0.774-0.821). According to 
the SHAP plots, old age, low Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) score, high AKI stage, 
reduced urine output, high Simplified Acute Physiology Score (SAPS II), high 
respiratory rate, low temperature, low absolute lymphocyte count, high 
creatinine level, dysnatremia, and low body mass index (BMI) increased the risk 
of poor prognosis.
CONCLUSIONS: The RF model developed in this study is a good predictor of 
in-hospital mortality for patients with SA-AKI in the intensive care unit (ICU), 
which may have potential applications in mortality prediction.

BACKGROUND: The Triglyceride Glucose-Body Mass Index (TyG-BMI) has been 
established as a robust indicator of insulin resistance (IR), reflecting 
metabolic health across various populations. In general, lower TyG-BMI values 
are often associated with better metabolic health outcomes and a reduced risk of 
adverse health events in non-critically ill populations. Previous studies have 
highlighted a significant negative association between TyG-BMI and all-cause 
mortality (ACM) among critically ill atrial fibrillation patients. Given the 
high prevalence and severe outcomes associated with stroke, understanding how 
TyG-BMI at the time of ICU admission correlates with ACM in critically ill 
stroke patients becomes imperative. This study aims to assess the correlation 
between TyG-BMI and ACM in this specific patient cohort, exploring how 
traditional associations between TyG-BMI and metabolic health may differ in the 
context of acute, life-threatening illness.
METHODS: Patient data were retrieved by accessing the Medical Information Mart 
for Intensive Care IV (MIMIC-IV 2.2) database, categorizing patients into three 
groups on the basis of TyG-BMI tertiles. The study evaluated both primary and 
secondary outcomes: the primary outcomes included the 90-day, 180-day, and 
1-year ACM, while secondary outcomes encompassed ICU, in-hospital, and 30-day 
ACM. Our study employed the Kaplan-Meier (K-M) curve method for outcome 
comparison across the groups while utilizing multivariate Cox 
proportional-hazards regression models and restricted cubic splines (RCS) to 
explore TyG-BMI association with these outcomes. Additionally, interaction and 
subgroup analyses were performed, focusing on different mortality time points.
RESULTS: Among a cohort of 1707 individuals diagnosed with stroke, the average 
age was 68 years (interquartile range [IQR]: 58-78 years), with 946 (55.42%) of 
the participants being male. The analysis of K-M curves suggested that patients 
having a lower TyG-BMI level faced a heightened risk of long-term ACM, whereas 
the short-term ACM exhibited no statistically significant differences across the 
three TyG-BMI groups. Furthermore, Cox proportional-hazards regression analysis 
validated a statistically significant increased risk of long-term ACM among 
patients belonging to the lowest TyG-BMI tertile. Additionally, RCS analysis 
results demonstrated L-shaped correlations between the TyG-BMI index and both 
short- and long-term ACM. These findings underscore the TyG-BMI predictive value 
for long-term mortality in stroke patients, highlighting a nuanced relationship 
that varies over different time frames. The results revealed no interactions 
between TyG-BMI and the stratified variables, with the exception of age.
CONCLUSION: In our study, lower TyG-BMI levels in critically ill stroke patients 
are significantly related to a higher risk of long-term ACM within the context 
of the United States. This finding suggests the potential of TyG-BMI as a marker 
for stratifying long-term risk in this patient population. However, it's crucial 
to note that this association was not observed for short-term ACM, indicating 
that the utility of TyG-BMI may be more pronounced in long-term outcome 
prediction. Additionally, our conclusion that TyG-BMI could serve as a reliable 
indicator for managing and stratifying stroke patients over the long term is 
preliminary. To confirm our findings and assess the universal applicability of 
TyG-BMI as a prognostic tool, it is crucial to conduct rigorously designed 
research across various populations.

BACKGROUND: The mortality rate of patients with sepsis-associated acute kidney 
injury (SA-AKI) in the intensive care unit (ICU) is high, and there is a need 
for early identification of SA-AKI patients with poor prognoses. This study 
investigated the relationship between the lactate dehydrogenase to serum albumin 
ratio (LAR) and prognosis in patients with SA-AKI.
METHODS: We performed a retrospective cohort study of patients with SA-AKI who 
are represented in the Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care IV 
(MIMIC-IV). We used multivariable Cox regression analysis to determine adjusted 
hazard ratios (HRs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs). Subgroup analysis, 
survival curves, and curve fitting were used to evaluate a connection between 
the LAR and prognosis in patients with SA-AKI.
RESULTS: There were a total of 6453 participants in this research. The average 
age of the participants was 63.9 ± 16.1 years, and the average LAR was 11.0 
(7.6, 17.7)/IU/g. After controlling for variables, the HRs for 28-day mortality 
were 1.20 (HR: 1.20, 95% CI: 1.05-1.38, p = 0.008) and 1.61 (HR: 1.61, 95% CI: 
1.41-1.84, p < 0.001) for Tertile 2 (T2, 8.59≤ LAR< 14.66) and Tertile 3 (T3, 
LAR ≥ 14.66), respectively, compared to Tertile 1 (T1, LAR < 8.59). The outcomes 
for 90-day mortality and in-hospital death rate were comparable. The 
Kaplan-Meier (KM) analysis revealed that the group with greater LAR had higher 
28-day and 90-day death rates.
CONCLUSION: Our study shows that LAR is associated with poor prognosis in 
patients with SA-AKI. Higher LAR is associated with higher 28-day, 90-day, and 
in-hospital mortality.

OBJECTIVE: Sepsis remains a high cause of death, particularly in 
immunocompromised patients with cancer. The study was to develop a model to 
predict hospital mortality of septic patients with cancer in intensive care unit 
(ICU).
DESIGN: Retrospective observational study.
SETTING: Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care IV (MIMIC IV) and eICU 
Collaborative Research Database (eICU-CRD).
PARTICIPANTS: A total of 3796 patients in MIMIC IV and 549 patients in eICU-CRD 
were included.
PRIMARY OUTCOME MEASURES: The model was developed based on MIMIC IV. The 
internal validation and external validation were based on MIMIC IV and eICU-CRD, 
respectively. Candidate factors were processed with the least absolute shrinkage 
and selection operator regression and cross-validation. Hospital mortality was 
predicted by the multivariable logistical regression and visualised by the 
nomogram. The model was assessed by the area under the curve (AUC), calibration 
curve and decision curve analysis curve.
RESULTS: The model exhibited favourable discrimination (AUC: 0.726 (95% CI: 
0.709 to 0.744) and 0.756 (95% CI: 0.712 to 0.801)) in the internal and external 
validation sets, respectively, and better calibration capacity than Acute 
Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation IV in external validation.
CONCLUSIONS: Despite that the predicted model was based on a retrospective 
study, it may also be helpful to predict the hospital morality of patients with 
solid cancer and sepsis.

BACKGROUND: To construct and evaluate a predictive model for in-hospital 
mortality among critically ill patients with acute kidney injury (AKI) 
undergoing continuous renal replacement therapy (CRRT), based on nine machine 
learning (ML) algorithm.
METHODS: The study retrospectively included patients with AKI who underwent CRRT 
during their initial hospitalization in the United States using the medical 
information mart for intensive care (MIMIC) database IV (version 2.0), as well 
as in the intensive care unit (ICU) of Huzhou Central Hospital. Patients from 
the MIMIC database were used as the training cohort to construct the models 
(from 2008 to 2019, n = 1068). Patients from Huzhou Central Hospital were 
utilized as the external validation cohort to evaluate the models (from June 
2019 to December 2022, n = 327). In the training cohort, least absolute 
shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) regression with cross-validation was 
employed to select features for constructing the model and subsequently 
established nine ML predictive models. The performance of these nine models on 
the external validation cohort dataset was comprehensively evaluated based on 
the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUROC) and the 
optimal model was selected. A static nomogram and a web-based dynamic nomogram 
were presented, with a comprehensive evaluation from the perspectives of 
discrimination (AUROC), calibration (calibration curve) and clinical 
practicability (DCA curves).
RESULTS: Finally, 1395 eligible patients were enrolled, including 1068 patients 
in the training cohort and 327 patients in the external validation cohort. In 
the training cohort, LASSO regression with cross-validation was employed to 
select features and nine models were individually constructed. Compared to the 
other eight models, the Lasso regularized logistic regression (Lasso-LR) model 
exhibited the highest AUROC (0.756) and the optimal calibration curve. The DCA 
curve suggested a certain clinical utility in predicting in-hospital mortality 
among critically ill patients with AKI undergoing CRRT. Consequently, the 
Lasso-LR model was the optimal model and it was visualized as a common nomogram 
(static nomogram) and a web-based dynamic nomogram 
(https://chsyh2006.shinyapps.io/dynnomapp/). Discrimination, calibration and DCA 
curves were employed to assess the performance of the nomogram. The AUROC for 
the training and external validation cohorts in the nomogram model was 0.771 
(95%CI: 0.743, 0.799) and 0.756 (95%CI: 0.702, 0.809), respectively. The 
calibration slope and Brier score for the training cohort were 1.000 and 0.195, 
while for the external validation cohort, they were 0.849 and 0.197, 
respectively. The DCA indicated that the model had a certain clinical 
application value.
CONCLUSIONS: Our study selected the optimal model and visualized it as a static 
and dynamic nomogram integrating clinical predictors, so that clinicians can 
personalized predict the in-hospital outcome of critically ill patients with AKI 
undergoing CRRT upon ICU admission.

BACKGROUND: Sepsis is a common critical condition caused by the body's 
overwhelming response to certain infective agents. Many biomarkers, including 
the serum lactate level, have been used for sepsis diagnosis and guiding 
treatment. Recently, the Third International Consensus Definitions for Sepsis 
and Septic Shock (Sepsis-3) recommended the Sequential Organ Failure Assessment 
(SOFA) and the quick SOFA (qSOFA) rather than lactate for screening sepsis and 
assess prognosis. Here, we aim to explore and compare the prognostic accuracy of 
the lactate level, the SOFA score and the qSOFA score for mortality in septic 
patients using the public Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care III 
database (MIMIC III).
METHODS: The baseline characteristics, laboratory test results and outcomes for 
sepsis patients were retrieved from MIMIC III. Survival was analysed by the 
Kaplan-Meier method. Univariate and multivariate analysis was performed to 
identify predictors of prognosis. Receiver operating characteristic curve (ROC) 
analysis was conducted to compare lactate with SOFA and qSOFA scores.
RESULTS: A total of 3713 cases were initially identified. The analysis cohort 
included 1865 patients. The 24-h average lactate levels and the worst scores 
during the first 24 h of ICU admission were collected. Patients in the higher 
lactate group had higher mortality than those in the lower lactate group. 
Lactate was an independent predictor of sepsis prognosis. The AUROC of lactate 
(AUROC, 0.664 [95% CI, 0.639-0.689]) was significantly higher than that of qSOFA 
(AUROC, 0.547 [95% CI, 0.521-0.574]), and it was similar to the AUROC of SOFA 
(AUROC, 0.686 [95% CI, 0.661-0.710]). But the timing of lactate relative to SOFA 
and qSOFA scores was inconsistent.
CONCLUSION: Lactate is an independent prognostic predictor of mortality for 
patients with sepsis. It has superior discriminative power to qSOFA, and shows 
discriminative ability similar to that of SOFA.

PURPOSE: Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) concurrent with 
respiratory failure (RF) is devastating, and may result in death and disability. 
Systemic immune-inflammation index (SII) is a new prognostic biomarker linked to 
unfavorable outcomes of acute coronary syndrome, ischemic stroke, and heart 
failure. Nonetheless, its role in COPD is rarely investigated. Consequently, 
this study intends to assess the accuracy of SII in predicting the prognosis of 
COPD.
PATIENTS AND METHODS: The clinical information was retrospectively acquired from 
the Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care-IV database. The outcomes 
encompassed the incidence of RF and mortality. The relationship between 
different SII and outcomes was examined utilizing the Cox proportional-hazards 
model and restricted cubic splines. Kaplan-Meier analysis was employed for 
all-cause mortality.
RESULTS: The present study incorporated 1653 patients. During hospitalization, 
697 patients (42.2%) developed RF, and 169 patients (10.2%) died. And 637 
patients (38.5%) died during long-term follow-up. Higher SII increased the risk 
of RF (RF: HR: 1.19, 95% CI 1.12-1.28, P<0.001), in-hospital mortality (HR: 
1.22, 95% CI 1.07-1.39, P=0.003), and long-term follow-up mortality (HR: 1.12, 
95% CI 1.05-1.19, P<0.001). Kaplan-Meier analysis suggested a significantly 
elevated risk of all-cause death (log-rank P<0.001) in patients with higher SII, 
especially during the short-term follow-up period of 21 days.
CONCLUSION: SII is closely linked to an elevated risk of RF and death in COPD 
patients. It appears to be a potential predictor of the prognosis of COPD 
patients, which is helpful for the risk stratification of this population. 
However, more prospective studies are warranted to consolidate our conclusion.

BACKGROUND: Triglyceride-glucose (TyG) index, a dependable indicator of insulin 
resistance, has been identified as a valid marker regarding multiple 
cardiovascular diseases. Nevertheless, the correlation of TyG index with acute 
myocardial infarction complicated by cardiogenic shock (AMICS) remains 
uncertain. Our study aims for elucidating this relationship by comprehensively 
analyzing two large-scale cohorts.
METHODS: Utilizing records from the eICU Collaborative Research Database and the 
Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care IV, the link between TyG and the 
incidence and prognosis of AMICS was assessed multicentrally and retrospectively 
by logistic and correlation models, as well as restricted cubic spline (RCS). 
Propensity score matching (PSM), inverse probability of treatment weighting 
(IPTW), and overlap weighting (OW) were employed to balance the potential 
confounders. Subgroup analyses were performed according to potential modifiers.
RESULTS: Overall, 5208 AMI patients, consisting of 375 developing CS were 
finally included. The TyG index exhibited an apparently higher level in AMI 
populations developing CS than in those who did not experienced CS [9.2 
(8.8-9.7) vs. 9.0 (8.5-9.5)], with a moderate discrimination ability to 
recognize AMICS from the general AMI (AUC: 0.604). Logistic analyses showed that 
the TyG index was significantly correlated with in-hospital and ICU mortality. 
RCS analysis demonstrated a linear link between elevated TyG and increased risks 
regarding in-hospital and ICU mortality in the AMICS population. An increased 
mortality risk remains evident in PSM-, OW- and IPTW-adjusted populations with 
higher TyG index who have undergone CS. Correlation analyses demonstrated an 
apparent link between TyG index and APS score. Subgroup analyses presented a 
stable link between elevated TyG and mortality particularly in older age, 
females, those who are overweight or hypertensive, as well as those without 
diabetes.
CONCLUSIONS: Elevated TyG index was related to the incidence of CS following AMI 
and higher mortality risks in the population with AMICS. Our findings pointed a 
previously undisclosed role of TyG index in regard to AMICS that still requires 
further validation.

OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to evaluate the association between the Endothelial 
Activation and Stress Index (EASIX) and 30-day mortality risk in acute 
myocardial infarction (AMI) patients.
METHODS: Using a retrospective cohort design, data were extracted from the 
Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care-IV (MIMIC-IV) database between 2008 
and 2019. Patients diagnosed with AMI at intensive care unit (ICU) admission 
were included. EASIX score was calculated as follows: lactate dehydrogenase 
(LDH) level (U/L) × creatinine level (mg/dL)/platelet count (109/L). Cox 
regression models assessed the association between EASIX and 30-day mortality, 
with subgroup analyses based on age, gender, AMI subtype, and sepsis status.
RESULTS: A total of 1,036 patients were analyzed, among whom 323 did not survive 
beyond 30 days post-ICU admission. Higher EASIX scores were associated with 
increased 30-day mortality in AMI patients [Hazard ratio (HR): 1.70, 95% 
confidence interval (CI): 1.17-2.46, P = 0.005). Subgroup analyses supported 
these findings and revealed significant interactions between EASIX and variables 
such as gender and AMI subtype (P < 0.05).
CONCLUSION: Elevated EASIX scores are significantly correlated with increased 
30-day mortality risk in AMI patients, suggesting EASIX as a valuable prognostic 
tool that may inform clinical management strategies to improve outcomes in AMI.

BACKGROUND: The effectiveness of aspirin treatment in septic patients remains a 
subject of debates.
OBJECTIVE: To explore the association between aspirin usage and the prognosis of 
patients with sepsis-induced myocardial injury (SIMI), as well as the timing of 
aspirin administration.
METHODS: Patients with SIMI were screened in the MIMIC-IV database and 
categorized into aspirin and non-aspirin groups based on their medications 
during intensive care unit (ICU) stay, and propensity matching analysis (PSM) 
was subsequently performed to reduce bias at baseline between the groups. The 
primary outcome was 28-day all-cause mortality. Cox multivariate regression 
analysis was conducted to evaluate the impact of aspirin on the prognosis of 
patients with SIMI.
RESULTS: The pre-PSM and post-PSM cohorts included 1170 and 1055 patients, 
respectively. In the pre-PSM cohort, the aspirin group is older, has a higher 
proportion of chronic comorbidities, and lower SOFA and SAPS II scores when 
compared to the non-aspirin group. In the PSM analysis, most of the baseline 
characterization biases were corrected, and aspirin use was also associated with 
lower 28-day mortality (hazard ratio [HR] = 0.51, 95 % confidence interval [CI]: 
0.42-0.63, P < 0.001), 90-day mortality (HR = 0.58, 95 % CI: 0.49-0.69, 
P < 0.001) and 1-year mortality (HR = 0.65, 95 % CI: 0.56-0.76, P < 0.001), 
irrespective of aspirin administration timing. A sensitivity analysis based on 
the original cohort confirmed the robustness of the findings. Additionally, 
subsequent subgroup analysis revealed that the use of vasopressin have a 
significant interaction with aspirin's efficacy.
CONCLUSION: Aspirin was associated with decreased mortality in SIMI patients, 
and this beneficial effect persisted regardless of pre-ICU treatment.

BACKGROUND: Millions of patients undergo cardiac surgery each year. The red 
blood cell distribution width (RDW) could help predict the prognosis of patients 
who undergo percutaneous coronary intervention or coronary artery bypass 
surgery. We investigated whether the RDW has robust predictive value for the 
30-day mortality among patients in an intensive care unit (ICU) after undergoing 
cardiac surgery.
METHODS: Using the Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care-IV Database, we 
retrieved data for 11,634 patients who underwent cardiac surgery in an ICU. We 
performed multivariate Cox regression analysis to model the association between 
the RDW and 30-day mortality and plotted Kaplan-Meier curves. Subgroup analyses 
were stratified using relevant covariates. Receiver operating characteristic 
(ROC) curves were used to determine the predictive value of the RDWs.
RESULTS: The total 30-day mortality rate was 4.2% (485/11,502). The elevated-RDW 
group had a higher 30-day mortality rate than the normal-RDW group (P&0.001). 
The robustness of our data analysis was confirmed by performing subgroup 
analyses. Each unit increase in the RDW was associated with a 17% increase in 
30-day mortality when the RDW was used as a continuous variable (adjusted hazard 
ratio=1.17, 95% confidence interval, 1.10-1.25). Our ROC results showed the 
predictive value of the RDW.
CONCLUSIONS: An elevated RDW was associated with a higher 30-day mortality in 
patients after undergoing cardiac surgery in an ICU setting. The RDW can serve 
as an efficient and accessible method for predicting the mortality of patients 
in ICUs following cardiac surgery.

Healthcare professionals in healthcare systems need access to freely available, 
real-time, evidence-based mortality risk prediction smartphone applications to 
facilitate resource allocation. The objective of this study is to evaluate the 
quality of smartphone mobile health applications that include mortality 
prediction models, and corresponding information quality. We conducted a 
systematic review of commercially available smartphone applications in Google 
Play for Android, and iTunes for iOS smartphone applications. We performed 
initial screening, data extraction, and rated smartphone application quality 
using the Mobile Application Rating Scale: user version (uMARS). The information 
quality of smartphone applications was evaluated using two patient vignettes, 
representing low and high risk of mortality, based on critical care data from 
the Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care (MIMIC) III database. Out of 
3051 evaluated smartphone applications, 33 met our final inclusion criteria. We 
identified 21 discrete mortality risk prediction models in smartphone 
applications. The most common mortality predicting models were Sequential Organ 
Failure Assessment (SOFA) (n = 15) and Acute Physiology and Clinical Health 
Assessment II (n = 13). The smartphone applications with the highest quality 
uMARS scores were Observation-NEWS 2 (4.64) for iOS smartphones, and MDCalc 
Medical Calculator (4.75) for Android smartphones. All SOFA-based smartphone 
applications provided consistent information quality with the original SOFA 
model for both the low and high-risk patient vignettes. We identified freely 
available, high-quality mortality risk prediction smartphone applications that 
can be used by healthcare professionals to make evidence-based decisions in 
critical care environments.

BACKGROUND: Statins exert pleiotropic anti-inflammatory and antioxidant effects 
in addition to their cholesterol-lowering properties. This study aimed to 
investigate whether statin use is associated with improved outcomes of sepsis.
METHODS: Data from patients with sepsis were extracted from the Medical 
Information Mart for Intensive Care IV database. Patients with a history of 
receiving prescriptions for statins (i.e., atorvastatin, lovastatin, 
pitavastatin, pravastatin, rosuvastatin, or simvastatin) were matched with 
non-users using propensity-score matching, to balance confounding factors 
between the groups. Mendelian randomization (MR) analyses were performed using 
information from the UK Biobank dataset to explore the potential causal link 
between low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) levels and LDL-C lowering 
effects via genetically inhibiting β‑hydroxy β-methylglutaryl-coenzyme A 
reductase and the susceptibility to sepsis, and the sepsis-related 28-day 
mortality.
MAIN RESULTS: 90-day mortality rate was lower among the 10,323 statin users when 
compared to matched non-users [hazard ratio (HR): 0.612, 95% CI: 0.571 to 
0.655]. In-hospital mortality was also lower for statin users compared to 
non-users (11.3% vs. 17.8%, p < 0.0001, HR: 0.590, 95% CI: 0.548 to 0.634). 
Statin use was associated with better outcome in all investigated subpopulations 
apart from patients with severe liver disease. MR analyses further pointed 
toward pleiotropic effects beyond lipid-lowering effects of statins on 
sepsis-related outcomes.
CONCLUSIONS: Statin use is associated with improved outcomes following 
sepsis-related intensive care unit (ICU) admission, most likely from its 
pleiotropic properties, characterized by lower 90-day and in-hospital mortality 
among statin users.

INTRODUCTION: Acute pancreatitis (AP) is a prevalent inflammatory disease that 
can lead to severe abdominal pain and multiple organ failure, potentially 
resulting in pancreatic necrosis and persistent dysfunction. A nomogram 
prediction model was developed to accurately evaluate the prognosis and provide 
therapy guidance to AP patients.
MATERIAL AND METHODS: Retrospective data extraction was performed using 
MIMIC-IV, an open-source clinical database, to obtain 1344 AP patient records, 
of which the primary dataset included 1030 patients after the removal of 
repeated hospitalizations. The prediction of in-hospital mortality (IHM) used 
the least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) regression model to 
optimize feature selection. A multivariate logistic regression analysis was used 
to build a prediction model incorporating the selected features, and the 
C-index, calibration plot, and decision curve analysis (DCA) were utilized to 
evaluate the discrimination, calibration, and clinical applicability of the 
prediction model.
RESULTS: The nomogram utilized a combination of indicators, including the SAPS 
II score, RDW, MBP, RR, PTT, and fluid-electrolyte disorders. Impressively, the 
model exhibited a satisfactory diagnostic performance, with area under the curve 
values of 0.892 and 0.856 for the training cohort and internal validation, 
respectively. Moreover, the calibration plots and the Hosmer-Lemeshow 
goodness-of-fit (HL) test revealed a strong correlation between the predicted 
and actual outcomes (p = 0.73), further confirming the reliability of our model. 
Notably, the results of the decision curve analysis (DCA) highlighted the 
superiority of our model over previously described scoring methods in terms of 
net clinical benefit, solidifying its value in clinical applications.
CONCLUSIONS: Our novel nomogram is a simple tool for accurately predicting IHM 
in ICU patients with AP. Treatment methods that enhance the factors involved in 
the model may contribute to increased in-hospital survival for these ICU 
patients.

The prime purpose of the proposed study is to construct a novel predictive 
scheme for assisting in the prognosis of criticality using the MIMIC-III 
dataset. With the adoption of various analytics and advanced computing in the 
healthcare system, there is an increasing trend toward developing an effective 
prognostication mechanism. Predictive-based modeling is the best alternative to 
work in this direction. This paper discusses various scientific contributions 
using desk research methodology towards the Medical Information Mart for 
Intensive Care (MIMIC-III). This open-access dataset is meant to help predict 
patient trajectories for various purposes ranging from mortality forecasting to 
treatment planning. With a dominant machine learning approach in this 
perspective, there is a need to discover the effectiveness of existing 
predictive methods. The resultant outcome of this paper offers an inclusive 
discussion about various available predictive schemes and clinical diagnoses 
using MIMIC-III in order to contribute toward better information associated with 
its strengths and weaknesses. Therefore, the paper provides a clear 
visualization of existing schemes for clinical diagnosis using a systematic 
review approach.

In this study, we aimed to investigate the risk factors associated with 
in-hospital mortality in patients with cirrhosis and sepsis, establish and 
validate the nomogram. This retrospective study included patients diagnosed with 
liver cirrhosis and sepsis in the Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care IV 
(MIMIC-IV). Models were compared by the area under the curve (AUC), integrated 
discriminant improvement (IDI), net reclassification index (NRI) and decision 
curve analysis (DCA). A total of 1,696 patients with cirrhosis and sepsis were 
included in the final cohort. Our final model included the following 9 
variables: age, heartrate, total bilirubin (TBIL), glucose, sodium, anion gap 
(AG), fungal infections, mechanical ventilation, and vasopressin. The nomogram 
were constructed based on these variables. The AUC values of the nomograms were 
0.805 (95% CI 0.776-0.833), which provided significantly higher discrimination 
compared to that of SOFA score [0.684 (95% CI 0.647-0.720)], MELD-Na [0.672 (95% 
CI 0.636-0.709)] and ABIC [0.674(95% CI 0.638-0.710)]. We established the first 
nomogram for predicting in-hospital mortality in patients with liver cirrhosis 
and sepsis based on these factors. This nomogram can performs well and 
facilitates clinicians to identify people at high risk of in-hospital mortality.

INTRODUCTION: This study aims to construct a mortality prediction model for 
patients with non-variceal upper gastrointestinal bleeding (NVUGIB) in the 
intensive care unit (ICU), employing advanced machine learning algorithms. The 
goal is to identify high-risk populations early, contributing to a deeper 
understanding of patients with NVUGIB in the ICU.
METHODS: We extracted NVUGIB data from the Medical Information Mart for 
Intensive Care IV (MIMIC-IV, v.2.2) database spanning from 2008 to 2019. Feature 
selection was conducted through LASSO regression, followed by training models 
using 11 machine learning methods. The best model was chosen based on the area 
under the curve (AUC). Subsequently, Shapley additive explanations (SHAP) was 
employed to elucidate how each factor influenced the model. Finally, a case was 
randomly selected, and the model was utilized to predict its mortality, 
demonstrating the practical application of the developed model.
RESULTS: In total, 2716 patients with NVUGIB were deemed eligible for 
participation. Following selection, 30 out of a total of 64 clinical parameters 
collected on day 1 after ICU admission remained associated with prognosis and 
were utilized for developing machine learning models. Among the 11 constructed 
models, the Gradient Boosting Decision Tree (GBDT) model demonstrated the best 
performance, achieving an AUC of 0.853 and an accuracy of 0.839 in the 
validation cohort. Feature importance analysis highlighted that shock, Glasgow 
Coma Scale (GCS), renal disease, age, albumin, and alanine aminotransferase 
(ALP) were the top six features of the GBDT model with the most significant 
impact. Furthermore, SHAP force analysis illustrated how the constructed model 
visualized the individualized prediction of death.
CONCLUSIONS: Patient data from the MIMIC database were leveraged to develop a 
robust prognostic model for patients with NVUGIB in the ICU. The analysis using 
SHAP also assisted clinicians in gaining a deeper understanding of the disease.

OBJECTIVES: Sepsis is an infection-caused syndrome, that leads to 
life-threatening organ damage. We aim to develop machine learning models with 
large-scale data to predict sepsis patients' mortality.
DESIGN: we extracted sepsis patients from two databases, Medical Information 
Mart for Intensive Care IV (MIMIC-IV) as a train set and Philips eICU 
Collaborative Research Database as a test set.
SETTING: ICUs in multicenter hospitals in the USA during 2012-2019.
PATIENTS OR PARTICIPANTS: A total of 21,680 sepsis-3 patients are included in 
the study, in which, 3771 patients were dead and 17,909 survived during 
hospitalization, respectively.
INTERVENTIONS: No interventions.
MAIN VARIABLES OF INTEREST: Basic information, examination items during 
hospitalization and some medication and treatment information are incorporated 
into analyzed. Seven different models were built with a Support vector machine, 
Decision Tree Classifier, Random Forest, Gradients Boosting, Multiple Layer 
Perception, Xgboost, light Gradients Boosting to predict dead or live during 
hospitalization.
RESULTS: Algorithms with an AUC value in the test set of the top three: light 
GBM, GBM, Xgboost. Considering the performance of the training set and the test 
set, the light GBM model performs best, and then the parameters of the model 
were adjusted, after that the AUC value was 0.99 in the train set, 0.96 in the 
test set, respectively.
CONCLUSIONS: Models built with light GBM algorithm from real-world sepsis 
patients from electronic health records accurately predict whether sepsis 
patients are dead and can be incorporated into clinical decision tools to 
enhance the prognosis of the patient and prevent adverse outcomes.

Background: Endothelial Activation and Stress Index (EASIX) is a reliable 
alternative biomarker of endothelial dysfunction. Because endothelial activation 
is involved in sepsis pathophysiology, we aimed to investigate the association 
between EASIX and prognosis in septic patients. Methods: Data were extracted 
from the Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care (MIMIC) IV database. EASIX 
scores were calculated using the formula: lactate dehydrogenase (U/L) × 
creatinine (mg/dL)/platelet count (109/L). Patients were grouped into tertiles 
according to log2 transformed EASIX. The primary and secondary outcomes were 
28-day and 90-day mortality. Cox proportional hazards models, Kaplan-Meier 
curves, restricted cubic spline curves, and subgroup analyses were conducted to 
evaluate the association between EASIX and prognosis in septic patients. 
Results: A total of 7504 patients were included. Multivariable Cox proportional 
hazards analyses showed that higher log2-EASIX was associated with increased 
risk of 28-day mortality (HR, 1.10; 95% CI, 1.07-1.13; P < 0.001). Compared with 
tertile 1, the tertile 2 and 3 groups had higher risk of 28-day mortality [HR 
(95% CI) 1.24 (1.09-1.41); HR (95% CI) 1.51 (1.31-1.74)]; P for trend < 0.001). 
Similar results were found for 90-day mortality. Kaplan-Meier curves showed that 
patients with higher EASIX had lower 28-day and 90-day survival rates. A linear 
relationship was found between log2-EASIX and 28-day and 90-day mortality. 
Conclusion: High EASIX was significantly associated with an increased risk of 
28-day and 90-day all-cause mortality in patients with sepsis.

BACKGROUND: The occurrence of acute kidney injury (AKI) was associated with an 
increased mortality rate among acute pancreatitis (AP) patients, indicating the 
importance of accurately predicting the mortality rate of critically ill 
patients with acute pancreatitis-associated acute kidney injury (AP-AKI) at an 
early stage. This study aimed to develop and validate machine learning-based 
predictive models for in-hospital mortality rate in critically ill patients with 
AP-AKI by comparing their performance with the traditional logistic regression 
(LR) model.
METHODS: This study used data from three clinical databases. The predictors were 
identified by the Recursive Feature Elimination algorithm. The LR and two 
machine learning models-random forest (RF) and eXtreme Gradient Boosting 
(XGBoost)-were developed using 10-fold cross-validation to predict in-hospital 
mortality rate in AP-AKI patients.
RESULTS: A total of 1089 patients from the Medical Information Mart for 
Intensive Care-IV (MIMIC-IV) and eICU Collaborative Research Database (eICU-CRD) 
were included in the training set and 176 patients from Xiangya Hospital were 
included in the external validation set. The in-hospital mortality rates of the 
training and external validation sets were 13.77% and 54.55%, respectively. 
Compared with the area under the curve (AUC) values of the LR model and the RF 
model, the AUC value of the XGBoost model {0.941 [95% confidence interval (CI) 
0.931-0.952]} was significantly higher (both P < .001) and the XGBoost model had 
the smallest Brier score of 0.039 in the training set. In the external 
validation set, the performance of the XGBoost model was acceptable, with an AUC 
value of 0.724 (95% CI 0.648-0.800). However, it did not differ significantly 
from the LR and RF models.
CONCLUSIONS: The XGBoost model was superior to the LR and RF models in terms of 
both the discrimination and calibration in the training set. Whether the 
findings can be generalized needs to be further validated.

BACKGROUND: Intensive Care Unit (ICU) readmissions in patients with heart 
failure (HF) result in a significant risk of death and financial burden for 
patients and healthcare systems. Prediction of at-risk patients for readmission 
allows for targeted interventions that reduce morbidity and mortality.
METHODS AND RESULTS: We presented a process mining/deep learning approach for 
the prediction of unplanned 30-day readmission of ICU patients with HF. A 
patient's health records can be understood as a sequence of observations called 
event logs; used to discover a process model. Time information was extracted 
using the DREAM (Decay Replay Mining) algorithm. Demographic information and 
severity scores upon admission were then combined with the time information and 
fed to a neural network (NN) model to further enhance the prediction efficiency. 
Additionally, several machine learning (ML) algorithms were developed to be used 
as the baseline models for the comparison of the results.
RESULTS: By using the Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care III 
(MIMIC-III) dataset of 3411 ICU patients with HF, our proposed model yielded an 
area under the receiver operating characteristics (AUROC) of 0.930, 95% 
confidence interval of [0.898-0.960], the precision of 0.886, sensitivity of 
0.805, accuracy of 0.841, and F-score of 0.800 which were far better than the 
results of the best baseline model and the existing literature.
CONCLUSIONS: The proposed approach was capable of modeling the time-related 
variables and incorporating the medical history of patients from prior hospital 
visits for prediction. Thus, our approach significantly improved the outcome 
prediction compared to that of other ML-based models and health calculators.

BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: Traumatic Brain Injury (TBI) is one of the leading 
causes of injury-related mortality in the world, with severe cases reaching 
mortality rates of 30-40%. It is highly heterogeneous both in causes and 
consequences making more complex the medical interpretation and prognosis. 
Gathering clinical, demographic, and laboratory data to perform a prognosis 
requires time and skill in several clinical specialties. Artificial intelligence 
(AI) methods can take advantage of existing data by performing helpful 
predictions and guiding physicians toward a better prognosis and, consequently, 
better healthcare. The objective of this work was to develop learning models and 
evaluate their capability of predicting the mortality of TBI. The predictive 
model would allow the early assessment of the more serious cases and scarce 
medical resources can be pointed toward the patients who need them most.
METHODS: Long Short Term Memory (LSTM) and Transformer architectures were tested 
and compared in performance, coupled with data imbalance, missing data, and 
feature selection strategies. From the Medical Information Mart for Intensive 
Care III (MIMIC-III) dataset, a cohort of TBI patients was selected and an 
analysis of the first 48 hours of multiple time series sequential variables was 
done to predict hospital mortality.
RESULTS: The best performance was obtained with the Transformer architecture, 
achieving an AUC of 0.907 with the larger group of features and trained with 
class proportion class weights and binary cross entropy loss.
CONCLUSIONS: Using the time series sequential data, LSTM and Transformers proved 
to be both viable options for predicting TBI hospital mortality in 48 hours 
after admission. Overall, using sequential deep learning models with time series 
data to predict TBI mortality is viable and can be used as a helpful indicator 
of the well-being of patients.

The purpose is to analyze the prevalence of intestinal infection in patients 
with pneumonia in intensive care units (ICU) and the impact of intestinal 
infection on the prognosis of patients with pneumonia, so as to explore the 
bidirectional association between pneumonia and intestinal infection. The study 
aims to investigate the correlation between the occurrence of pneumonia and 
intestinal infection among patients in the ICU, utilizing the Medical 
Information Mart for Intensive Care IV (MIMIC-IV) database, as well as the 
impact of intestinal infection on the prognosis of pneumonia patients. The 
enrolled patients were first divided into pneumonia group and non-pneumonia 
group, and the primary outcome was that patients developed intestinal infection. 
Multivariate logistic regression was used to elucidate the association between 
pneumonia and the prevalence of intestinal infection, and propensity score 
matching (PSM) and inverse probability of treatment weighing (IPTW) were used to 
validate our findings. We then divided patients with pneumonia into two groups 
according to whether they were complicated by intestinal infection, and analyzed 
the effect of intestinal infection on 28-day mortality, length of ICU stay, and 
length of hospital stay in patients with pneumonia. This study included 50,920 
patients, of which 7493 were diagnosed with pneumonia. Compared with 
non-pneumonia patients, the incidence of intestinal infection in pneumonia 
patients was significantly increased [OR 1.58 (95% CI 1.34-1.85; P < 0.001)]. 
Cox proportional hazards regression model showed no significant effect of 
co-infection on 28-day mortality in patients with pneumonia (P = 0.223). 
Patients in the intestinal infection group exhibited a longer length stay in ICU 
and hospital than those without intestinal infection (P < 0.001). In the ICU, 
patients with pneumonia were more likely linked to intestinal infection. In 
addition, the presence of concurrent intestinal infections can prolong both ICU 
and hospital stays for pneumonia patients.

Sepsis triggers a harmful immune response due to infection, causing high 
mortality. Predicting sepsis outcomes early is vital. Despite machine learning's 
(ML) use in medical research, local validation within the Medical Information 
Mart for Intensive Care IV (MIMIC-IV) database is lacking. We aimed to devise a 
prognostic model, leveraging MIMIC-IV data, to predict sepsis mortality and 
validate it in a Chinese teaching hospital. MIMIC-IV provided patient data, 
split into training and internal validation sets. Four ML models logistic 
regression (LR), support vector machine (SVM), deep neural networks (DNN), and 
extreme gradient boosting (XGBoost) were employed. Shapley additive 
interpretation offered early and interpretable mortality predictions. Area under 
the ROC curve (AUROC) gaged predictive performance. Results were cross verified 
in a Chinese teaching hospital. The study included 27,134 sepsis patients from 
MIMIC-IV and 487 from China. After comparing, 52 clinical indicators were 
selected for ML model development. All models exhibited excellent discriminative 
ability. XGBoost surpassed others, with AUROC of 0.873 internally and 0.844 
externally. XGBoost outperformed other ML models (LR: 0.829; SVM: 0.830; DNN: 
0.837) and clinical scores (Simplified Acute Physiology Score II: 0.728; 
Sequential Organ Failure Assessment: 0.728; Oxford Acute Severity of Illness 
Score: 0.738; Glasgow Coma Scale: 0.691). XGBoost's hospital mortality 
prediction achieved AUROC 0.873, sensitivity 0.818, accuracy 0.777, specificity 
0.768, and F1 score 0.551. We crafted an interpretable model for sepsis death 
risk prediction. ML algorithms surpassed traditional scores for sepsis mortality 
forecast. Validation in a Chinese teaching hospital echoed these findings.

OBJECTIVES: Early hemorrhage detection in intensive care units (ICUs) enables 
timely intervention and reduces the risk of irreversible outcomes. In this 
study, we aimed to develop a machine learning model to predict hemorrhage by 
learning the patterns of continuously changing, real-world clinical data.
METHODS: We used the Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care databases 
(MIMIC-III and MIMIC-IV). A recurrent neural network was used to predict severe 
hemorrhage in the ICU. We developed three machine learning models with an 
increasing number of input features and levels of complexity: model 1 (11 
features), model 2 (18 features), and model 3 (27 features). MIMIC-III was used 
for model training, and MIMIC-IV was split for internal validation. Using the 
model with the highest performance, external verification was performed using 
data from a subgroup extracted from the eICU Collaborative Research Database.
RESULTS: We included 5,670 ICU admissions, with 3,150 in the training set and 
2,520 in the internal test set. A positive correlation was found between model 
complexity and performance. As a measure of performance, three models developed 
with an increasing number of features showed area under the receiver operating 
characteristic (AUROC) curve values of 0.61-0.94 according to the range of input 
data. In the subgroup extracted from the eICU database for external validation, 
an AUROC value of 0.74 was observed.
CONCLUSIONS: Machine learning models that rely on real clinical data can be used 
to predict patients at high risk of bleeding in the ICU.

BACKGROUND: The prognostic nutritional index (PNI), reflecting the body's 
immune-nutritional status, has been established as a correlate of prognosis 
across various diseases. However, its significance in community-acquired 
pneumonia (CAP) remains unclear. This study investigated the relationship 
between PNI and clinical outcomes in CAP patients.
METHODS: In this retrospective cohort study, we aimed to evaluate the prognostic 
value of the PNI in adults with CAP admitted to the ICU. Participants were 
selected from the Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care IV (MIMIC-IV) 
database and categorized into quartiles (Q1-Q4) according to their PNI values. 
We employed Kaplan-Meier survival analysis, multivariate Cox regression, and 
restricted cubic spline (RCS) models to explore the association between PNI and 
the clinical outcomes of these CAP patients.
RESULTS: In this study, we included 1,608 patients with CAP. The observed 30-day 
and 90-day mortality rates stood at 30.85% and 39.99%, respectively. Patients 
with higher PNI levels exhibited a reduced risk of both 30-day and 90-day 
mortality. Following adjustment for confounders, PNI showed a significant 
negative association with 30-day mortality [HR, 0.93 (0.91-0.94), P < 0.001] and 
90-day mortality [HR, 0.94 (0.92-0.95), P < 0.001]. RCS analysis revealed a 
consistent trend of declining all-cause mortality risk corresponding to 
increasing PNI values. PNI demonstrated predictive value for 30-day and 90-day 
mortality in CAP patients, with AUCs of 0.71 and 0.68, respectively. Combining 
PNI with CURB-65 enhanced the predictive value of CURB-65.
CONCLUSION: Our investigation identified a significant negative association 
between the PNI and the risk of mortality in patients with CAP. Additionally, 
the PNI demonstrated superior predictive value for mortality risk in CAP 
patients when compared to the CURB-65 scoring system.

If a patient can be discharged from an intensive care unit (ICU) is usually 
decided by the treating physicians based on their clinical experience. However, 
nowadays limited capacities and growing socioeconomic burden of our health 
systems increase the pressure to discharge patients as early as possible, which 
may lead to higher readmission rates and potentially fatal consequences for the 
patients. Therefore, here we present a long short-term memory-based deep 
learning model (LSTM) trained on time series data from Medical Information Mart 
for Intensive Care (MIMIC-III) dataset to assist physicians in making decisions 
if patients can be safely discharged from cardiovascular ICUs. To underline the 
strengths of our LSTM we compare its performance with a logistic regression 
model, a random forest, extra trees, a feedforward neural network and with an 
already known, more complex LSTM as well as an LSTM combined with a 
convolutional neural network. The results of our evaluation show that our LSTM 
outperforms most of the above models in terms of area under receiver operating 
characteristic curve. Moreover, our LSTM shows the best performance with respect 
to the area under precision-recall curve. The deep learning solution presented 
in this article can help physicians decide on patient discharge from the ICU. 
This may not only help to increase the quality of patient care, but may also 
help to reduce costs and to optimize ICU resources. Further, the presented 
LSTM-based approach may help to improve existing and develop new medical machine 
learning prediction models.

BACKGROUND: Sepsis is a life-threatening disease with high morbidity and 
mortality, characterized by an inadequate systemic immune response to an initial 
stimulus. Whether the use of ondansetron (OND) during intensive care unit (ICU) 
stay is associated with the prognosis of sepsis patients remains unclear.
METHODS: Critically ill patients with sepsis were extracted from the Medical 
Information Mart for Intensive Care IV (MIMIC-IV) database. Multivariate 
logistic regression and Cox regression analyses were used to explore the 
association between OND use and clinical outcomes after adjusting for 
confounders. Kaplan-Meier survival curve was used for survival analysis. 
Propensity score matching (PSM) and subgroup analysis were performed to further 
confirm the results.
RESULTS: The OND-medication group showed reduced in-hospital mortality, 28-day 
and 90-day mortalities. The OR for in-hospital mortality was 0.80 (0.64-0.99) 
and HRs for 28-day mortality and 90-day mortality were 0.77 (0.64-0.92) and 0.83 
(0.70-0.98), respectively. After PSM, the clinical outcomes remained consistent. 
In-hospital mortality was lower in the OND-medication group (28.1% vs. 35.8%, P= 
0.044), as well as 28-day mortality (23.4% vs. 32.1%, P=0.022) and 90-day 
mortality (27.4% vs. 35.8%, P=0.035). The protective effect of OND in sepsis 
patients was relatively robust, independent of age, septic shock, vasopressin 
and mechanical ventilation. Additionally, the OND users had longer lengths of 
stay in ICU (6.9(3.1-13.2) vs. 5.1(2.5-11.0), P = 0.026) while no statistical 
differences were found in lengths of stay in hospital (P = 0.333).
CONCLUSION: OND exposure might be associated with lower in-hospital, 28-day, and 
90-day mortality rates in critically ill patients with sepsis. This study 
indicated that OND might help improve the prognosis of patients with sepsis.

The stress hyperglycemia ratio (SHR) is established as a reliable marker for 
assessing the severity of stress-induced hyperglycemia. While its effectiveness 
in managing patients with Acute Ischemic Stroke (AIS) remains to be fully 
understood. We aim to explore the relationship between SHR and clinical 
prognosis in AIS patients and to assess how diabetes status influences this 
relationship. In this study, we analyzed data from the Medical Information Mart 
for Intensive Care (MIMIC-IV) database, selecting patients with AIS who required 
ICU admission. These patients were categorized into tertiles based on their SHR 
levels. We applied Cox hazard regression models and used restricted cubic spline 
(RCS) curves to investigate relationships between outcomes and SHR. The study 
enrolled a total of 2029 patients. Cox regression demonstrated that a strong 
correlation was found between increasing SHR levels and higher all-cause 
mortality. Patients in the higher two tertiles of SHR experienced significantly 
elevated 30-day and 90-day mortality rates compared to those in the lowest 
tertile. This pattern remained consistent regardless of diabetes status. 
Further, RCS analysis confirmed a progressively increasing risk of all-cause 
mortality with higher SHR levels. The findings indicate that SHR is association 
with increased 30-day and 90-day mortality among AIS patients, underscoring its 
potential value in risk stratification. Although the presence of diabetes may 
weaken this association, significant correlations persist in diabetic patients.

BACKGROUND: Hip fractures in the elderly often lead to acute respiratory 
failure, but there is currently no tool to assess the prognosis of such 
patients. This study aims to develop a risk prediction model for respiratory 
failure in these patients.
METHODS: A retrospective cross-sectional study was conducted using the Medical 
Information Mart for Intensive Care (MIMIC)-IV database, incorporating data from 
3,266 patients with hip fractures aged over 55 years from 2008 to 2019. Data 
included demographic information, laboratory indicators, comorbidities, and 
treatment methods. Patients were divided into a training group (70%) and a 
validation group (30%). Least Absolute Shrinkage and Selection Operator (LASSO) 
regression was applied to select prognostic predictors, and a visualized 
nomogram model was constructed using multivariate logistic regression analysis. 
Model performance and clinical applicability were assessed. Statistical analyses 
were done using R4.2.2, with P < 0.05 deemed significant.
RESULTS: Seven key factors, including age, height, albumin, chloride, pneumonia, 
acute kidney injury (AKI), and heparin use, were associated with respiratory 
failure risk. The model demonstrated good performance with area under the curve 
(AUC) values of 0.77 and 0.73 in the training and validation sets, respectively. 
The calibration curve showed good agreement, and decision curve analysis (DCA) 
indicated the model's clinical benefit.
CONCLUSIONS: This risk prediction model can effectively predict respiratory 
failure in hip fracture patients, assisting clinicians in identifying high-risk 
individuals and providing evidence-based references for treatment strategies.

INTRODUCE: The purpose of this study was to establish a comprehensive prognosis 
nomogram for patients with liver cirrhosis complicated with hepatic 
encephalopathy (HE) in the intensive care unit (ICU) and to evaluate the 
predictive value of the nomogram.
METHOD: This study analyzed 620 patients with liver cirrhosis complicated with 
HE from the Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care III(MIMIC-III) database. 
The patients were randomly divided into two groups in a 7-to-3 ratio to form a 
training cohort (n = 434) and a validation cohort (n = 176). Cox regression 
analyses were used to identify associated risk variables. Based on the 
multivariate Cox regression model results, a nomogram was established using 
associated risk predictor variables to predict the 90-day survival rate of 
patients with cirrhosis complicated with HE. The new model was compared with the 
Sequential organ failure assessment (SOFA) scoring model in terms of the 
concordance index (C-index), the area under the curve (AUC) of receiver 
operating characteristic (ROC) analysis, the net reclassification improvement 
(NRI), the integrated discrimination improvement (IDI), calibration curve, and 
decision curve analysis (DCA).
RESULTS: This study showed that older age, higher mean heart rate, lower mean 
arterial pressure, lower mean temperature, higher SOFA score, higher RDW, and 
the use of albumin were risk factors for the prognosis of patients with liver 
cirrhosis complicated with HE. The use of proton pump inhibitors (PPI) was a 
protective factor. The performance of the nomogram was evaluated using the 
C-index, AUC, IDI value, NRI value, and DCA curve, showing that the nomogram was 
superior to that of the SOFA model alone. Calibration curve results showed that 
the nomogram had excellent calibration capability. The decision curve analysis 
confirmed the good clinical application ability of the nomogram.
CONCLUSION: This study is the first study of the 90-day survival rate prediction 
of cirrhotic patients with HE in ICU through the data of the MIMIC-III database. 
It is confirmed that the eight-factor nomogram has good efficiency in predicting 
the 90-day survival rate of patients.

Background: Urinary tract infection (UTI) is one of the common causes of sepsis. 
However, nomograms predicting the sepsis risk in UTI patients have not been 
comprehensively researched. The goal of this study was to establish and validate 
a nomogram to predict the probability of sepsis in UTI patients. Methods: 
Patients diagnosed with UTI were extracted from the Medical Information Mart for 
Intensive Care III database. These patients were randomly divided into training 
and validation cohorts. Independent prognostic factors for UTI patients were 
determined using forward stepwise logistic regression. A nomogram containing 
these factors was established to predict the sepsis incidence in UTI patients. 
The validity of our nomogram model was determined using multiple indicators, 
including the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC), 
correction curve, Hosmer-Lemeshow test, integrated discrimination improvement 
(IDI), net reclassification improvement (NRI), and decision-curve analysis 
(DCA). Results: This study included 6,551 UTI patients. Stepwise regression 
analysis revealed that the independent risk factors for sepsis in UTI patients 
were congestive heart failure, diabetes, liver disease, fluid electrolyte 
disorders, APSIII, neutrophils, lymphocytes, red blood cell distribution width, 
urinary protein, urinary blood, and microorganisms. The nomogram was then 
constructed and validated. The AUC, NRI, IDI and DCA of the nomogram all showed 
better performance than traditional APSIII score. The calibration curve and 
Hosmer-Lemeshow test results indicate that the nomogram was well-calibrated. 
Improved NRI and IDI values indicate that our nomogram scoring system is 
superior to other commonly used ICU scoring systems. The DCA curve indicates 
that the DCA map of the nomogram has good clinical application ability. 
Conclusion: This study identified the independent risk factors of sepsis in UTI 
patients and used them to construct a prediction model. The present findings may 
provide clinical reference information for preventing sepsis in UTI patients.

Immunosuppression and malnutrition play pivotal roles in the complications of 
intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH) and are intricately linked to the development of 
stroke-associated pneumonia (SAP). Inflammatory markers, including NLR 
(neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio), SII (systemic immune inflammation index), SIRI 
(systemic inflammatory response index), and SIS (systemic inflammation score), 
along with nutritional indexes such as CONUT (controlling nutritional status) 
and PNI (prognostic nutritional index), are crucial indicators influencing the 
inflammatory state following ICH. In this study, our objective was to compare 
the predictive efficacy of inflammatory and nutritional indices for SAP in ICH 
patients, aiming to determine and explore their clinical utility in early 
pneumonia detection. Patients with severe ICH requiring ICU admission were 
screened from the Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care IV (MIMIC-IV) 
database. The outcomes included the occurrence of SAP and in-hospital death. 
Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis, multivariate logistic 
regression, smooth curve analysis, and stratified analysis were employed to 
investigate the relationship between the CONUT index and the clinical outcomes 
of patients with severe ICH. A total of 348 patients were enrolled in the study. 
The incidence of SAP was 21.3%, and the in-hospital mortality rate was 17.0%. 
Among these indicators, multiple regression analysis revealed that CONUT, PNI, 
and SIRI were independently associated with SAP. Further ROC curve analysis 
demonstrated that CONUT (AUC 0.6743, 95% CI 0.6079-0.7408) exhibited the most 
robust predictive ability for SAP in patients with ICH. Threshold analysis 
revealed that when CONUT < 6, an increase of 1 point in CONUT was associated 
with a 1.39 times higher risk of SAP. Similarly, our findings indicate that 
CONUT has the potential to predict the prognosis of patients with ICH. Among the 
inflammatory and nutritional markers, CONUT stands out as the most reliable 
predictor of SAP in patients with ICH. Additionally, it proves to be a valuable 
indicator for assessing the prognosis of patients with ICH.

BACKGROUND: To explore the association between myocardial enzymes and one-year 
mortality, and establish a nomogram integrating myocardial enzymes and clinical 
characteristics to predict one-year mortality among sepsis patients.
METHODS: Data of 1,983 sepsis patients were extracted from Medical Information 
Mart for Intensive Care III database in this retrospective cohort study. All 
participants were randomly split into the training set for the development of 
model and testing set for the internal validation at the ratio of 7:3. 
Univariate logistic regression was used to screen variables with statistical 
differences which were made for stepwise regression, obtaining the predictors 
associated with one-year mortality of sepsis patients. Adopted multivariate 
logistic regression to assess the relationship between myocardial enzymes and 
one-year mortality of sepsis patients. A nomogram was established in predicting 
the one-year survival status of sepsis patients, and the performance of 
developed model were compared with LDH alone, sequential organ failure 
assessment (SOFA), simplified acute physiology score II (SAPS II) by receiver 
operator characteristic, calibration, and decision curves analysis.
RESULTS: The result found that LDH was associated with one-year mortality of 
sepsis patients [odds ratio = 1.28, 95% confidence interval (CI): 1.18-1.52]. 
Independent predictors, including age, gender, ethnicity, potassium, calcium, 
albumin, hemoglobin, alkaline phosphatase, vasopressor, Elixhauser score, 
respiratory failure, and LDH were identified and used to establish the nomogram 
(LDH-model) for predicting one-year mortality for sepsis patients. The predicted 
performance [area under curve (AUC) = 0.773, 95%CI: 0.748-0.798] of this 
developed nomogram in the training and testing sets (AUC = 0.750, 95%CI: 
0.711-0.789), which was superior to that of LDH alone, SOFA score, SAPS II 
score. Additionally, calibration curve indicated that LDH-model may have a good 
agreement between the predictive and actual outcomes, while decision curve 
analysis demonstrated clinical utility of the LDH-model.
CONCLUSION: LDH level was related to the risk of one-year mortality in sepsis 
patients. A prediction model based on LDH and clinical features was developed to 
predict one-year mortality risk of sepsis patients, surpassing the predictive 
ability of LDH alone as well as conventional SAPS II and SOFA scoring systems.

Sepsis is a serious complication of liver cirrhosis. This study aimed to develop 
a risk prediction model for sepsis among patients with liver cirrhosis. A total 
of 3130 patients with liver cirrhosis were enrolled from the Medical Information 
Mart for Intensive Care IV database, and randomly assigned into training and 
validation cohorts in a 7:3 ratio. The least absolute shrinkage and selection 
operator (LASSO) regression was used to filter variables and select predictor 
variables. Multivariate logistic regression was used to establish the prediction 
model. Based on LASSO and multivariate logistic regression, gender, base excess, 
bicarbonate, white blood cells, potassium, fibrinogen, systolic blood pressure, 
mechanical ventilation, and vasopressor use were identified as independent risk 
variables, and then a nomogram was constructed and validated. The consistency 
index (C-index), receiver operating characteristic curve, calibration curve, and 
decision curve analysis (DCA) were used to measure the predictive performance of 
the nomogram. As a result of the nomogram, good discrimination was achieved, 
with C-indexes of 0.814 and 0.828 for the training and validation cohorts, 
respectively, and an area under the curve of 0.849 in the training cohort and 
0.821 in the validation cohort. The calibration curves demonstrated good 
agreement between the predictions and observations. The DCA curves showed the 
nomogram had significant clinical value. We developed and validated a 
risk-prediction model for sepsis in patients with liver cirrhosis. This model 
can assist clinicians in the early detection and prevention of sepsis in 
patients with liver cirrhosis.

Risk stratification and prognosis evaluation of severe thrombocytopenia are 
essential for clinical treatment and management. Currently, there is currently 
no reliable predictive model to identify patients at high risk of severe 
thrombocytopenia. This study aimed to develop and validate a prognostic nomogram 
model to predict in-hospital mortality in patients with severe thrombocytopenia 
in the intensive care unit. Patients diagnosed with severe thrombocytopenia 
(N = 1561) in the Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care IV database were 
randomly divided into training (70%) and validation (30%) cohorts. In the 
training cohort, univariate and multivariate logistic regression analyses with 
positive stepwise selection were performed to screen the candidate variables, 
and variables with p < 0.05 were included in the nomogram model. The nomogram 
model was compared with traditional severity assessment tools and included the 
following 13 variables: age, cerebrovascular disease, malignant cancer, oxygen 
saturation, heart rate, mean arterial pressure, respiration rate, mechanical 
ventilation, vasopressor, continuous renal replacement therapy, prothrombin 
time, partial thromboplastin time, and blood urea nitrogen. The nomogram was 
well-calibrated. According to the area under the receiver operating 
characteristics, reclassification improvement, and integrated discrimination 
improvement, the nomogram model performed better than the traditional sequential 
organ failure assessment (SOFA) score and simplified acute physiology score II 
(SAPS II). Additionally, according to decision curve analysis, a threshold 
probability between 0.1 and 0.75 indicated that our constructed nomogram model 
showed more net benefits than the SOFA score and SAPS II. The nomogram model we 
established showed superior predictive performance and can assist in the 
quantitative assessment of the prognostic risk in patients with severe 
thrombocytopenia.

BackgroundTo develop and validate a mortality prediction model for patients with 
sepsis-associated Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS).MethodsThis 
retrospective cohort study included 2466 patients diagnosed with sepsis and ARDS 
within 24 h of ICU admission. Demographic, clinical, and laboratory parameters 
were extracted from Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care III (MIMIC-III) 
database. Feature selection was performed using the Boruta algorithm, followed 
by the construction of seven ML models: logistic regression, Naive Bayes, 
k-nearest neighbor, support vector machine, decision tree, Random Forest, and 
extreme gradient boosting. Model performance was evaluated using the area under 
the receiver operating characteristic curve, accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, 
positive predictive value, and negative predictive value.ResultsThe study 
identified 24 variables significantly associated with mortality. The optimal ML 
model, a Random Forest model, demonstrated an AUC of 0.8015 in the test set, 
with high accuracy and specificity. The model highlighted the importance of 
blood urea nitrogen, age, urine output, Simplified Acute Physiology Score II, 
and albumin levels in predicting mortality.ConclusionsThe model's superior 
predictive performance underscores the potential for integrating advanced 
analytics into clinical decision-making processes, potentially improving patient 
outcomes and resource allocation in critical care settings.

Objectives: This study aims to investigate whether the machine learning 
algorithms could provide an optimal early mortality prediction method compared 
with other scoring systems for patients with cerebral hemorrhage in intensive 
care units in clinical practice. Methods: Between 2008 and 2012, from Intensive 
Care III (MIMIC-III) database, all cerebral hemorrhage patients monitored with 
the MetaVision system and admitted to intensive care units were enrolled in this 
study. The calibration, discrimination, and risk classification of predicted 
hospital mortality based on machine learning algorithms were assessed. The 
primary outcome was hospital mortality. Model performance was assessed with 
accuracy and receiver operating characteristic curve analysis. Results: Of 760 
cerebral hemorrhage patients enrolled from MIMIC database [mean age, 68.2 years 
(SD, ±15.5)], 383 (50.4%) patients died in hospital, and 377 (49.6%) patients 
survived. The area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) of 
six machine learning algorithms was 0.600 (nearest neighbors), 0.617 (decision 
tree), 0.655 (neural net), 0.671(AdaBoost), 0.819 (random forest), and 0.725 
(gcForest). The AUC was 0.423 for Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation 
II score. The random forest had the highest specificity and accuracy, as well as 
the greatest AUC, showing the best ability to predict in-hospital mortality. 
Conclusions: Compared with conventional scoring system and the other five 
machine learning algorithms in this study, random forest algorithm had better 
performance in predicting in-hospital mortality for cerebral hemorrhage patients 
in intensive care units, and thus further research should be conducted on random 
forest algorithm.

Objective: Ondansetron administration is a common antemetic of acute 
pancreatitis therapy in the intensive care unit (ICU), but its actual 
association with patients' outcomes has not been confirmed. The study is aimed 
to determine whether the multiple outcomes of ICU patients with acute 
pancreatitis could benefit from ondansetron. Methods: 1,030 acute pancreatitis 
patients diagnosed in 2008-2019 were extracted from the Medical Information Mart 
for Intensive Care (MIMIC)-IV database as our study cohort. The primary outcome 
we considered is the 90-day prognosis, and secondary outcomes included 
in-hospital survival and overall prognosis. Results: In MIMIC-IV, 663 acute 
pancreatitis patients received ondansetron administration (OND group) during 
their hospitalization, while 367 patients did not (non-OND group). Patients in 
the OND group presented better in-hospital, 90-day, and overall survival curves 
than the non-OND group (log-rank test: in-hospital: p < 0.001, 90-day: p = 
0.002, overall: p = 0.009). After including covariates, ondansetron was 
associated with better survival in patients with multiple outcomes (in-hospital: 
HR = 0.50, 90-day: HR = 0.63, overall: HR = 0.66), and the optimal dose 
inflection points were 7.8 mg, 4.9 mg, and 4.6 mg, respectively. The survival 
benefit of ondansetron was unique and stable in the multivariate analyses after 
consideration of metoclopramide, diphenhydramine, and prochlorperazine, which 
may also be used as antiemetics. Conclusion: In ICU acute pancreatitis patients, 
ondansetron administration was associated with better 90-day outcomes, while 
results were similar in terms of in-hospital and overall outcomes, and the 
recommended minimum total dose might be suggested to be 4-8 mg.

BACKGROUND: Elevated glycemic variability (GV) often occurs in intensive care 
unit (ICU) patients and is associated with patient prognosis. However, the 
association between GV and prognosis in ICU patients with traumatic brain injury 
(TBI) remains unclear.
METHOD: Clinical data of ICU patients with TBI were obtained from the Medical 
Information Mart for Intensive Care (MIMIC) -IV database. The coefficient of 
variation (CV) was utilized to quantify GV, while the Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) 
was employed to evaluate the consciousness status of TBI patients. Pearson 
linear correlation analysis, linear regression, COX regression and restricted 
cubic spline (RCS) were used to investigate the relationship between CV and 
consciousness impairment, as well as the risk of in-hospital mortality.
RESULT: A total of 1641 ICU patients with TBI were included in the study from 
the MIMIC-IV database. Pearson linear correlation and restricted cubic spline 
(RCS) analysis results showed a negative linear relationship between CV and the 
last GCS (P = 0.002) with no evidence of nonlinearity (P for nonlinear = 0.733). 
Multivariable linear regression suggested a higher CV was associated with a 
lower discharge GCS [β (95 %CI) = -1.86 (-3.08 ∼ -0.65), P = 0.003]. 
Furthermore, multivariable COX regression indicated that CV ≥ 0.3 was a risk 
factor for in-hospital death in TBI patients [HR (95 %CI) = 1.74 (1.15-2.62), 
P = 0.003], and this result was also consistent across sensitivity and subgroup 
analyses.
CONCLUSION: Higher GV is related to poorer consciousness outcomes and increased 
risk of in-hospital death in ICU patients with TBI. Additional research is 
needed to understand the logical relationship between GV and TBI progression.

BACKGROUND: Cirrhotic patients with acute-on-chronic liver failure (ACLF) in the 
intensive care unit (ICU) have a poor but variable prognoses. Accurate prognosis 
evaluation can guide the rational management of patients with ACLF. However, 
existing prognostic scores for ACLF in the ICU environment lack sufficient 
accuracy.
AIM: To develop a new prognostic model for patients with ACLF in ICU.
METHODS: Data from 938 ACLF patients in the Medical Information Mart for 
Intensive Care (MIMIC) database were used to develop a new prognostic model 
(MIMIC ACLF) for ACLF. Discrimination, calibration and clinical utility of MIMIC 
ACLF were assessed by area under receiver operating characteristic curve 
(AUROC), calibration curve and decision curve analysis (DCA), respectively. 
MIMIC ACLF was then externally validated in a multiple-center cohort, the 
Electronic Intensive Care Collaborative Research Database and a single-center 
cohort from the Second Hospital of Hebei Medical University in China.
RESULTS: The MIMIC ACLF score was determined using nine variables: ln (age) × 
2.2 + ln (white blood cell count) × 0.22 - ln (mean arterial pressure) × 2.7 + 
respiratory failure × 0.6 + renal failure × 0.51 + cerebral failure × 0.31 + ln 
(total bilirubin) × 0.44 + ln (internationalized normal ratio) × 0.59 + ln 
(serum potassium) × 0.59. In MIMIC cohort, the AUROC (0.81/0.79) for MIMIC ACLF 
for 28/90-day ACLF mortality were significantly greater than those of Chronic 
Liver Failure Consortium ACLF (0.76/0.74), Model for End-stage Liver Disease 
(MELD; 0.73/0.71) and MELD-Na (0.72/0.70) (all P < 0.001). The consistency 
between actual and predicted 28/90-day survival rates of patients according to 
MIMIC ACLF score was excellent and superior to that of existing scores. The net 
benefit of MIMIC ACLF was greater than that achieved using existing scores 
within the 50% threshold probability. The superior predictive accuracy and 
clinical utility of MIMIC ACLF were validated in the external cohorts.
CONCLUSION: We developed and validated a new prognostic model with satisfactory 
accuracy for cirrhotic patients with ACLF hospitalized in the ICU. The 
model-based risk stratification and online calculator might facilitate the 
rational management of patients with ACLF.

BACKGROUND: Electronic Health Records (EHRs) aggregate diverse information at 
the patient level, holding a trajectory representative of the evolution of the 
patient health status throughout time. Although this information provides 
context and can be leveraged by physicians to monitor patient health and make 
more accurate prognoses/diagnoses, patient records can contain information from 
very long time spans, which combined with the rapid generation rate of medical 
data makes clinical decision making more complex. Patient trajectory modelling 
can assist by exploring existing information in a scalable manner, and can 
contribute in augmenting health care quality by fostering preventive medicine 
practices (e.g. earlier disease diagnosis).
METHODS: We propose a solution to model patient trajectories that combines 
different types of information (e.g. clinical text, standard codes) and 
considers the temporal aspect of clinical data. This solution leverages two 
different architectures: one supporting flexible sets of input features, to 
convert patient admissions into dense representations; and a second exploring 
extracted admission representations in a recurrent-based architecture, where 
patient trajectories are processed in sub-sequences using a sliding window 
mechanism.
RESULTS: The developed solution was evaluated on two different clinical 
outcomes, unexpected patient readmission and disease progression, using the 
publicly available Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care (MIMIC)-III 
clinical database. The results obtained demonstrate the potential of the first 
architecture to model readmission and diagnoses prediction using single patient 
admissions. While information from clinical text did not show the discriminative 
power observed in other existing works, this may be explained by the need to 
fine-tune the clinicalBERT model. Finally, we demonstrate the potential of the 
sequence-based architecture using a sliding window mechanism to represent the 
input data, attaining comparable performances to other existing solutions.
CONCLUSION: Herein, we explored DL-based techniques to model patient 
trajectories and propose two flexible architectures that explore patient 
admissions on an individual and sequence basis. The combination of clinical text 
with other types of information led to positive results, which can be further 
improved by including a fine-tuned version of clinicalBERT in the architectures. 
The proposed solution can be publicly accessed at

BACKGROUND: The primary objective was to examine the association between the 
lactate/albumin ratio (LAR) and the prognosis of patients with acute kidney 
injury (AKI) undergoing continuous renal replacement therapy (CRRT).
METHODS: Utilizing the Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care IV (MIMIC-IV, 
v2.0) database, we categorized 703 adult AKI patients undergoing CRRT into 
survival and non-survival groups based on 28-day mortality. Patients were 
further grouped by LAR tertiles: low (< 0.692), moderate (0.692-1.641), and high 
(> 1.641). Restricted cubic splines (RCS), Least Absolute Shrinkage and 
Selection Operator (LASSO) regression, inverse probability treatment weighting 
(IPTW), and Kaplan-Meier curves were employed.
RESULTS: In our study, the patients had a mortality rate of 50.07% within 
28 days and 62.87% within 360 days. RCS analysis revealed a non-linear 
correlation between LAR and the risk of mortality at both 28 and 360 days. Cox 
regression analysis, which was adjusted for nine variables identified by LASSO, 
confirmed that a high LAR (>1.641) served as an independent predictor of 
mortality at these specific time points (p < 0.05) in AKI patients who were 
receiving CRRT. These findings remained consistent even after IPTW adjustment, 
thereby ensuring a reliable and robust outcome. Kaplan-Meier survival curves 
exhibited a gradual decline in cumulative survival rates at both 28 and 360 days 
as the LAR values increased (log-rank test, χ2 = 48.630, p < 0.001; χ2 = 33.530, 
p < 0.001).
CONCLUSION: A high LAR (>1.641) was found to be an autonomous predictor of 
mortality at both 28 and 360 days in critically ill patients with AKI undergoing 
CRRT.

BACKGROUND: Currently, a scarcity of prognostic research exists that 
concentrates on patients with nephrotic syndrome (NS) who also have 
tuberculosis. The purpose of this study was to assess the in-hospital mortality 
status of NS patients with tuberculosis, identify crucial risk factors, and 
create a sturdy prognostic prediction model that can improve disease evaluation 
and guide clinical decision-making.
METHODS: We utilized the Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care IV version 
2.2 (MIMIC-IV v2.2) database to include 1,063 patients with NS complicated by TB 
infection. Confounding factors included demographics, vital signs, laboratory 
indicators, and comorbidities. The Least Absolute Shrinkage and Selection 
Operator (LASSO) regression and the diagnostic experiment the receiver operating 
characteristic (ROC) curve analyses were used to select determinant variables. A 
nomogram was established by using a logistic regression model. The performance 
of the nomogram was tested and validated using the concordance index (C-index) 
of the ROC curve, calibration curves, internal cross-validation, and clinical 
decision curve analysis.
RESULTS: The cumulative in-hospital mortality rate for patients with NS and TB 
was 18.7%. A nomogram was created to predict in-hospital mortality, utilizing 
Alb, Bun, INR, HR, Abp, Resp., Glu, CVD, Sepsis-3, and AKI stage 7 days. The 
area under the curve of the receiver operating characteristic evaluation was 
0.847 (0.812-0.881), with a calibration curve slope of 1.00 (0.83-1.17) and a 
mean absolute error of 0.013. The cross-validated C-index was 0.860. The 
decision curves indicated that the patients benefited from this model when the 
risk threshold was 0.1 and 0.81.
CONCLUSION: Our clinical prediction model nomogram demonstrated a good 
predictive ability for in-hospital mortality among patients with NS combined 
with TB. Therefore, it can aid clinicians in assessing the condition, judging 
prognosis, and making clinical decisions for such patients.

BACKGROUND: Systemic inflammation is closely associated with the development and 
progression of heart failure (HF), increasing vulnerability to thromboembolic 
events. This retrospective cohort study assessed the potential of the 
fibrinogen-to-albumin ratio (FAR), a new inflammatory biomarker, as a prognostic 
indicator for HF risk.
METHODS: One thousand one hundred and sixty six women and 826 men with a mean 
age of 70.70 ± 13.98 years were extracted from the Medical Information Mart for 
Intensive Care-IV (MIMIC-IV v2.0) database. Additionally, a second cohort was 
obtained, including 309 patients from the Second Affiliated Hospital of Wenzhou 
Medical University. The relationship between FAR and the prognosis of HF was 
evaluated using multivariate analysis, propensity score-matched analysis, and 
subgroup analysis.
RESULTS: Fibrinogen-to-albumin ratio was an independent risk factor for 90-day 
all-cause mortality (hazard ratio: 1.19; 95% confidence interval (CI): 
1.01-1.40), 1-year all-cause mortality (hazard ratio: 1.23; 95% confidence 
interval: 1.06-1.41), and length of hospital stay (LOS) (β: 1.52; 95% CI: 
0.67-2.37) in the MIMIC-IV dataset, even after adjusting for potential 
covariates. These findings were verified in the second cohort (β: 1.82; 95% CI: 
0.33-3.31) and persisted after propensity score-matching and subgroup analysis. 
FAR was positively correlated with C-reactive protein, NT-proBNP, and Padua 
score. The correlation between FAR and NT-proBNP (R = .3026) was higher than 
with fibrinogen (R = .2576), albumin (R = -.1822), platelet-to-albumin ratio 
(R = .1170), and platelet-to-lymphocyte ratio (R = .1878) (ps  < .05).
CONCLUSIONS: Fibrinogen-to-albumin ratio is an independent risk prognostic 
factor for 90-day, 1-year all-cause mortality and LOS among HF patients. 
Inflammation and prothrombotic state may underlie the relationship between FAR 
and poor prognosis in HF.

BACKGROUND: The clinical use of transthoracic echocardiography (TTE) in patients 
with acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) in the intensive care unit (ICU) 
has dramatically increased, its impact on long-term prognosis in these patients 
has not been studied. This study aimed to explore the effect of early-TTE on 
long-term mortality in patients with moderate-to-severe ARDS in ICU.
METHODS: A total of 2833 patients with moderate-to-severe ARDS who had or had 
not received early-TTE were obtained from the Medical Information Mart for 
Intensive Care (MIMIC-III) database after imputing missing values by a random 
forest model, patients were divided into early-TTE group and non-early-TTE group 
according to whether they received TTE examination in ICU. A variety of 
statistical methods were used to balance 41 covariates and increase the 
reliability of this study, including propensity score matching, inverse 
probability of treatment weight, covariate balancing propensity score, 
multivariable regression, and doubly robust estimation. Chi-Square test and 
t-tests were used to examine the differences between groups for categorical and 
continuous data, respectively.
RESULTS: There was a significant improvement in 90-day mortality in the 
early-TTE group compared to non-early-TTE group (odds ratio  =  0.79, 95% CI: 
0.64-0.98, p-value  =  0.036), revealing a beneficial effect of early-TTE. 
Net-input was significantly decreased in the early-TTE group on the third day of 
ICU admission and throughout the ICU stay, compared with non-early-TTE group 
(838.57 vs. 1181.89 mL, p-value  =  0.014; 4542.54 vs. 8025.25 mL, 
p-value  =  0.05). There was a significant difference in the reduction of serum 
lactate between the two groups, revealing the beneficial effect of early-TTE 
(0.59 vs. 0.83, p-value  =  0.009). Furthermore, the reduction in the proportion 
of acute kidney injury demonstrated a correlation between early-TTE and kidney 
protection (33% vs. 40%, p-value < 0.001).
CONCLUSIONS: Early application of TTE is beneficial to improve the long-term 
mortality of patients with moderate-to-severe ARDS.

BACKGROUND: Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) is a common nosocomial 
infection in the intensive care unit (ICU), with high in-hospital mortality. 
Current scoring systems are limited in predicting nosocomial death of VAP. This 
study aimed to develop and validate a more accurate and effective prediction 
model for in-hospital mortality in ICU patients with VAP.
METHODS: This was a retrospective cohort study. The demographic and clinical 
data of 8,182 adult patients with VAP were extracted from the Medical 
Information Mart for Intensive Care (MIMIC-III) database. All patients were 
randomly classified as a training set (n=4,629) and a test set (n=1,984) with a 
ratio of 7:3. The outcome was in-hospital mortality and the follow-up was 
terminated at discharge. Univariate and multivariate logistic regression 
analyses were used to identify the independent predictors and develop the 
prediction model in the training set, and internal validation was carried out in 
the test set. The receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve and calibration 
curve were plotted to evaluate the performance of the model.
RESULTS: Ethnicity, lung cancer history, septicemia history, hospital length of 
stay (LOS), fraction of inspired oxygen (FIO2) level, oxygen saturation (SPO2) 
level, Simplified Acute Physiology Score (SAPS II) score, Sequential Organ 
Failure Assessment (SOFA) score, and duration of invasive ventilation were all 
independently associated with the mortality of VAP. The algorithm of the 
prediction model was as follows: lnP/(1-P) = -0.700 + 0.493 Other Ethnicity + 
0.789 Lung Cancer (Yes) + 0.693 Septicemia (Yes) - 0.074 Hospital LOS - 0.008 
FIO2 - 0.032 SPO2 + 0.104 SOFA Score + 0.047 SAPS II + 0.004 Invasive 
Ventilation. The AUC was 0.837 in the training set and 0.817 in the test set, 
which indicated that the model performed well. The calibration curve also 
confirmed good calibration.
CONCLUSIONS: A model with good performance was developed to predict the 
individual death risk of VAP patients in the ICU, which might have the potential 
to provide ancillary data to support decision-making by physicians. External 
validation requires further evaluation of the model performance.

BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: Stress hyperglycemia is common in critically ill 
patients and is associated with poor prognosis. Whether this association exists 
in pulmonary hypertension (PH) patients is unknown. The present cohort study 
investigated the association of stress hyperglycemia with 90-day all-cause 
mortality in intensive care unit (ICU) patients with PH.
METHODS: Data of the study population were extracted from the Medical 
Information Mart for Intensive Care IV (MIMIC-IV) database. A new index, the 
ratio of admission glucose to HbA1c (GAR), was used to evaluate stress 
hyperglycemia. The study population was divided into groups according to GAR 
quartiles (Q1-Q4). The outcome of interest was all-cause mortality within 90 
days, which was considered a short-term prognosis.
RESULT: A total of 53,569 patients were screened. Ultimately, 414 PH patients 
were enrolled; 44.2% were male, and 23.2% were admitted to the cardiac ICU. As 
the GAR increased from Q2 to Q4, the groups had lower creatinine levels, longer 
ICU stays, and a higher proportion of renal disease. After adjusting for 
confounding factors such as demographics, vital signs, and comorbidities, an 
elevated GAR was associated with an increased risk of 90-day mortality.
CONCLUSION: Stress hyperglycemia assessed by the GAR was associated with 
increased 90-day mortality in ICU patients with PH.

Sepsis-Associated Liver Injury (SALI) is an independent risk factor for death 
from sepsis. The aim of this study was to develop an interpretable machine 
learning model for early prediction of 28-day mortality in patients with SALI. 
Data from the Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care (MIMIC-IV, v2.2, 
MIMIC-III, v1.4) were used in this study. The study cohort from MIMIC-IV was 
randomized to the training set (0.7) and the internal validation set (0.3), with 
MIMIC-III (2001 to 2008) as external validation. The features with more than 20% 
missing values were deleted and the remaining features were multiple 
interpolated. Lasso-CV that lasso linear model with iterative fitting along a 
regularization path in which the best model is selected by cross-validation was 
used to select important features for model development. Eight machine learning 
models including Random Forest (RF), Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, Extreme 
Gradient Boost (XGBoost), K Nearest Neighbor, Support Vector Machine, 
Generalized Linear Models in which the best model is selected by 
cross-validation (CV_glmnet), and Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA) were 
developed. Shapley additive interpretation (SHAP) was used to improve the 
interpretability of the optimal model. At last, a total of 1043 patients were 
included, of whom 710 were from MIMIC-IV and 333 from MIMIC-III. Twenty-four 
clinically relevant parameters were selected for model construction. For the 
prediction of 28-day mortality of SALI in the internal validation set, the area 
under the curve (AUC (95% CI)) of RF was 0.79 (95% CI: 0.73-0.86), and which 
performed the best. Compared with the traditional disease severity scores 
including Oxford Acute Severity of Illness Score (OASIS), Sequential Organ 
Failure Assessment (SOFA), Simplified Acute Physiology Score II (SAPS II), 
Logistic Organ Dysfunction Score (LODS), Systemic Inflammatory Response Syndrome 
(SIRS), and Acute Physiology Score III (APS III), RF also had the best 
performance. SHAP analysis found that Urine output, Charlson Comorbidity Index 
(CCI), minimal Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS_min), blood urea nitrogen (BUN) and 
admission_age were the five most important features affecting RF model. 
Therefore, RF has good predictive ability for 28-day mortality prediction in 
SALI. Urine output, CCI, GCS_min, BUN and age at admission(admission_age) within 
24 h after intensive care unit(ICU) admission contribute significantly to model 
prediction.

Sepsis-associated thrombocytopenia (SAT) is a common complication in the 
intensive care unit (ICU), which significantly increases the mortality rate and 
leads to poor prognosis of diseases. Machine learning (ML) is widely used in 
disease prediction in critically ill patients. Here, we aimed to establish 
prediction models for platelet decrease and severe platelet decrease in ICU 
patients with sepsis based on four common ML algorithms and identify the best 
prediction model. The research subjects were 1,455 ICU sepsis patients admitted 
to Dongyang People's Hospital affiliated with Wenzhou Medical University from 
January 1, 2015, to October 31, 2019. Basic clinical demographic information, 
biochemical indicators, and clinical outcomes were recorded. The prediction 
models were based on four ML algorithms: random forest, neural network, gradient 
boosting machine, and Bayesian algorithms. Thrombocytopenia was found to occur 
in 732 patients (49.7%). The mechanical ventilation time and length of ICU stay 
were longer, and the mortality rate was higher for the thrombocytopenia group 
than for the non-thrombocytopenia group. The models were validated on an online 
international database (Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care III). The 
areas under the receiver operating characteristic curves (AUCs) of the four 
models for the prediction of thrombocytopenia were between 0.54 and 0.72. The 
AUCs of the models for the prediction of severe thrombocytopenia were between 
0.70 and 0.77. The neural network and gradient boosting machine models 
effectively predicted the occurrence of SAT, and the Bayesian models had the 
best performance in predicting severe thrombocytopenia. Therefore, these models 
can be used to identify such high-risk patients at an early stage and guide 
individualized clinical treatment, to improve the prognosis of diseases.

BACKGROUND: Sepsis is one of the most life-threatening circumstances for 
critically ill patients in the United States, while diagnosis of sepsis is 
challenging as a standardized criteria for sepsis identification is still under 
development. Disparities in social determinants of sepsis patients can interfere 
with the risk prediction performances using machine learning.
METHODS: We analyzed a cohort of critical care patients from the Medical 
Information Mart for Intensive Care (MIMIC)-III database. Disparities in social 
determinants, including race, sex, marital status, insurance types and 
languages, among patients identified by six available sepsis criteria were 
revealed by forest plots with 95% confidence intervals. Sepsis patients were 
then identified by the Sepsis-3 criteria. Sixteen machine learning classifiers 
were trained to predict in-hospital mortality for sepsis patients on a training 
set constructed by random selection. The performance was measured by area under 
the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC). The performance of the 
trained model was tested on the entire randomly conducted test set and each 
sub-population built based on each of the following social determinants: race, 
sex, marital status, insurance type, and language. The fluctuations in 
performances were further examined by permutation tests.
RESULTS: We analyzed a total of 11,791 critical care patients from the MIMIC-III 
database. Within the population identified by each sepsis identification method, 
significant differences were observed among sub-populations regarding race, 
marital status, insurance type, and language. On the 5783 sepsis patients 
identified by the Sepsis-3 criteria statistically significant performance 
decreases for mortality prediction were observed when applying the trained 
machine learning model on Asian and Hispanic patients, as well as the 
Spanish-speaking patients. With pairwise comparison, we detected performance 
discrepancies in mortality prediction between Asian and White patients, Asians 
and patients of other races, as well as English-speaking and Spanish-speaking 
patients.
CONCLUSIONS: Disparities in proportions of patients identified by various sepsis 
criteria were detected among the different social determinant groups. The 
performances of mortality prediction for sepsis patients can be compromised when 
applying a universally trained model for each subpopulation. To achieve accurate 
diagnosis, a versatile diagnostic system for sepsis is needed to overcome the 
social determinant disparities of patients.

BACKGROUND: Concerns about the adverse effects of excessive oxygen have grown 
over the years. This study investigated the relationship between high oxygen 
saturation and short-term prognosis of patients with spontaneous intracerebral 
hemorrhage (sICH) after liberal use of oxygen.
METHODS: This retrospective cohort study collected data from the Medical 
Information Mart for Intensive Care III (MIMIC-III) database (ICU cohort) and a 
tertiary stroke center (general ward cohort). The data on pulse oximetry-derived 
oxygen saturation (SpO2) during the first 24 h in ICU and general wards were 
respectively extracted.
RESULTS: Overall, 1117 and 372 patients were included in the ICU and general 
ward cohort, respectively. Among the patients from the ICU cohort, a 
spoon-shaped association was observed between minimum SpO2 and the risk of 
in-hospital mortality (non-linear P<0.0001). In comparison with minimum SpO2 of 
93-97%, the minimum SpO2>97% was associated with a significantly higher risk of 
in-hospital mortality after adjustment for confounders. Sensitivity analysis 
conducted using propensity score matching did not change this significance. The 
same spoon-shaped association between minimum SpO2 and the risk of in-hospital 
mortality was also detected for the general ward cohort. In comparison with the 
group with 95-97% SpO2, the group with SpO2>97% showed a stronger association 
with, but non-significant risk for, in-hospital mortality after adjustment for 
confounders. The time-weighted average SpO2>97% was associated significantly 
with in-hospital mortality in both cohorts.
CONCLUSION: Higher SpO2 (especially a minimum SpO2>97%) was unrewarding after 
liberal use of oxygen among patients with sICH and might even be potentially 
detrimental.

BACKGROUND: The growing population of elderly neurocritically ill patients 
highlights the need for effective prognosis prediction tools. This study aims to 
develop and validate machine learning (ML) models for predicting 28-day 
mortality in intensive care units (ICUs).
METHODS: Data were extracted from the Medical Information Mart for Intensive 
Care IV(MIMIC-IV) database, focusing on elderly neurocritical ill patients with 
ICU stays ≥ 24 h. The cohort was split into 70 % for training and 30 % for 
internal validation. We analyzed 58 variables, including demographics, vital 
signs, medications, lab results, comorbidities, and medical scores, using Lasso 
regression to identify predictors of 28-day mortality. Seven ML algorithms were 
evaluated, and the best model was validated with data from Guizhou Medical 
University Affiliated Hospital. A log-rank test was used to assess survival 
differences in Kaplan-Meier curves. Shapley Additive Explanations (SHAP) were 
used to interpret the best model, while subgroup analysis identified variations 
in model performance across different populations.
RESULTS: The study included 1,773 elderly neurocritically ill patients, with a 
28-day mortality rate of 28.6 %. The Light Gradient Boosting Machine (LightGBM) 
outperformed other models, achieving an area under the curve (AUC) of 0.896 in 
internal validation and 0.812 in external validation. Kaplan-Meier analysis 
showed that higher LightGBM prediction scores correlated with lower survival 
probabilities. Key predictors identified through SHAP analysis included partial 
pressure of arterial carbon dioxide (PaCO2), Acute physiology and chronic health 
evaluation II (APACHE II), white blood cell count, age, and lactate. The 
LightGBM model demonstrated consistent performance across various subgroups.
CONCLUSIONS: The LightGBM model effectively predicts 28-day mortality risk in 
elderly neurocritically ill patients, aiding clinicians in management and 
resource allocation. Its reliable performance across diverse subgroups 
underscores its clinical utility.

BACKGROUND: Stress hyperglycemia ratio (SHR) has shown a predominant correlation 
with transient adverse events in critically ill patients. However, there remains 
a gap in comprehensive research regarding the association between SHR and 
mortality among patients experiencing cardiac arrest and admitted to the 
intensive care unit (ICU).
METHODS: A total of 535 patients with their initial ICU admission suffered 
cardiac arrest, according to the American Medical Information Mart for Intensive 
Care (MIMIC)-IV database. Patients were stratified into four categories based on 
quantiles of SHR. Multivariable Cox regression models were used to evaluate the 
association SHR and mortality. The association between SHR and mortality was 
assessed using multivariable Cox regression models. Subgroup analyses were 
conducted to determine whether SHR influenced ICU, 1-year, and long-term 
all-cause mortality in subgroups stratified according to diabetes status.
RESULTS: Patients with higher SHR, when compared to the reference quartile 1 
group, exhibited a greater risk of ICU mortality (adjusted hazard ratio [aHR] = 
3.029; 95% CI: 1.802-5.090), 1-year mortality (aHR = 3.057; 95% CI: 
1.885-4.958), and long-term mortality (aHR = 3.183; 95% CI: 2.020-5.015). This 
association was particularly noteworthy among patients without diabetes, as 
indicated by subgroup analysis.
CONCLUSION: Elevated SHR was notably associated with heightened risks of ICU, 
1-year, and long-term all-cause mortality among cardiac arrest patients. These 
findings underscore the importance of considering SHR as a potential prognostic 
factor in the critical care management of cardiac arrest patients, warranting 
further investigation and clinical attention.

BACKGROUND: Malnutrition adversely affects prognosis in various medical 
conditions, but its implications in older adults with Chronic Obstructive 
Pulmonary Disease (COPD) in the ICU are underexplored. The geriatric nutritional 
risk index (GNRI) is a novel tool for assessing malnutrition risk. This study 
investigates the association between GNRI and 90-day mortality in this 
population.
METHODS: We selected older adults with COPD admitted to the ICU from Medical 
Information Mart for Intensive Care (MIMIC)-IV 2.2 database. A total of 666 
patients were categorized into four groups based on their GNRI score: normal 
nutrition (>98), mild malnutrition (92-98), moderate malnutrition (82-91), and 
severe malnutrition (≤81) groups. We employed a restricted cubic spline (RCS) 
analysis to assess the presence of a curved relationship between them and to 
investigate any potential threshold saturation effect.
RESULTS: In multivariate Cox regression analyses, compared with individuals had 
normal nutrition (GNRI in Q4 >98), the adjusted HR values for GNRI in Q3 
(92-98), Q2 (82-91), and Q1 (≤81) were 1.81 (95% CI: 1.27-2.58, p=0.001), 1.23 
(95% CI: 0.84-1.79, p=0.296), 2.27 (95% CI: 1.57-3.29, p<0.001), respectively. 
The relationship between GNRI and 90-day mortality demonstrates an L-shaped 
curve (p=0.016), with an approximate inflection point at 101.5.
CONCLUSION: These findings imply that GNRI is a useful prognostic tool in older 
adults with COPD in the ICU. An L-shaped relationship was observed between GNRI 
and 90-day mortality in these patients.

BACKGROUND: Cardiac arrest (CA) is one of the leading causes of death globally, 
characterized by high incidence and mortality. It is of particular significance 
to determine the prognosis of patients with CA early and accurately. Therefore, 
we aim to investigate the correlation between albumin-corrected calcium (ACC) 
and the prognosis in patients diagnosed with CA.
METHODS: We retrospectively collected data from medical information mart for 
intensive care IV database. Patients were divided into two groups (survival and 
non-survival groups), according to the 90-day prognosis. In the Restricted cubic 
spline (RCS) analysis, the cut-off values (8.86 and 10.32) were obtained to 
categorize patients into three groups: low ACC group (< 8.86), moderate ACC 
group (8.86-10.32), and high ACC group (> 10.32). The least absolute shrinkage 
and selection operator with a ten-fold cross-validation regression analysis was 
performed to identify variables linked to the mortality. The inverse probability 
treatment weighting (IPTW) was used to address the confounding factors, and a 
weighted cohort was generated. RCS, Kaplan-Meier curve, and Cox regression 
analyses were used to explore the relationship between ACC and the mortality. 
Sensitivity analysis was employed to validate the stability of the results.
RESULTS: Cut-off values for ACC of 8.86 and 10.32 were determined. RCS analyses 
showed that there was an overall non-linear trend relationship between ACC and 
the risk of 90-day and 360-day mortalities. After IPTW adjustment, compared to 
the moderate ACC group, the 90-day and 360-day mortalities in the high ACC group 
were higher (P < 0.05). The Cox analyses before and after IPTW adjustment showed 
that both low ACC and high ACC group were independent risk factors for 90-day 
and 360-day all-cause mortality in patients with CA (P < 0.05). The results 
obtained from sensitivity analyses indicated the stability of the findings. The 
Kaplan-Meier survival curves indicated that 90- and 360-day cumulative survival 
rates in the low ACC and high ACC groups were lower than that in the moderate 
ACC group (χ2 = 11.350, P = 0.003; χ2 = 14.110, P = 0.001).
CONCLUSION: Both low ACC (< 8.86) and high ACC groups (> 10.32) were independent 
risk factors for 90-day and 360-day all-cause mortality in patients with CA 
(P < 0.05). For those CA patients with high and low ACC, it deserved the 
attention of clinicians.

Stroke is a major healthcare problem worldwide, particularly in the elderly 
population. Despite limited research on the development of prediction models for 
mortality in elderly individuals with ischemic stroke, our study aimed to 
address this knowledge gap. By leveraging data from the Medical Information Mart 
for Intensive Care IV database, we collected comprehensive raw data pertaining 
to elderly patients diagnosed with ischemic stroke. Through meticulous screening 
of clinical variables associated with 28-day mortality, we successfully 
established a robust nomogram. To assess the performance and clinical utility of 
our nomogram, various statistical analyses were conducted, including the 
concordance index, integrated discrimination improvement (IDI), net 
reclassification index (NRI), calibration curves and decision curve analysis 
(DCA). Our study comprised a total of 1259 individuals, who were further divided 
into training (n = 894) and validation (n = 365) cohorts. By identifying several 
common clinical features, we developed a nomogram that exhibited a concordance 
index of 0.809 in the training dataset. Notably, our findings demonstrated 
positive improvements in predictive performance through the IDI and NRI analyses 
in both cohorts. Furthermore, calibration curves indicated favorable agreement 
between the predicted and actual incidence of mortality (P > 0.05). DCA curves 
highlighted the substantial net clinical benefit of our nomogram compared to 
existing scoring systems used in routine clinical practice. In conclusion, our 
study successfully constructed and validated a prognostic nomogram, which 
enables accurate short-term mortality prediction in elderly individuals with 
ischemic stroke.

BACKGROUND: Sepsis is a syndrome involving multi-organ dysfunction, and the 
mortality in sepsis patients correlates with the number of lesioned organs. 
Precise prognosis models play a pivotal role in enabling healthcare 
practitioners to administer timely and accurate interventions for sepsis, 
thereby augmenting patient outcomes. Nevertheless, the majority of available 
models consider the overall physiological attributes of patients, overlooking 
the asynchronous spatiotemporal interactions among multiple organ systems. These 
constraints hinder a full application of such models, particularly when dealing 
with limited clinical data. To surmount these challenges, a comprehensive model, 
denoted as recurrent Graph Attention Network-multi Gated Recurrent Unit 
(rGAT-mGRU), was proposed. Taking into account the intricate spatiotemporal 
interactions among multiple organ systems, the model predicted in-hospital 
mortality of sepsis using data collected within the 48-hour period 
post-diagnosis.
MATERIAL AND METHODS: Multiple parallel GRU sub-models were formulated to 
investigate the temporal physiological variations of single organ systems. 
Meanwhile, a GAT structure featuring a memory unit was constructed to capture 
spatiotemporal connections among multi-organ systems. Additionally, an 
attention-injection mechanism was employed to govern the data flowing within the 
network pertaining to multi-organ systems. The proposed model underwent training 
and testing using a dataset of 10,181 sepsis cases extracted from the Medical 
Information Mart for Intensive Care III (MIMIC-III) database. To evaluate the 
model's superiority, it was compared with the existing common baseline models. 
Furthermore, ablation experiments were designed to elucidate the rationale and 
robustness of the proposed model.
RESULTS: Compared with the baseline models for predicting mortality of sepsis, 
the rGAT-mGRU model demonstrated the largest area under the receiver operating 
characteristic curve (AUROC) of 0.8777 ± 0.0039 and the maximum area under the 
precision-recall curve (AUPRC) of 0.5818 ± 0.0071, with sensitivity of 
0.8358 ± 0.0302 and specificity of 0.7727 ± 0.0229, respectively. The proposed 
model was capable of delineating the varying contribution of the involved organ 
systems at distinct moments, as specifically illustrated by the attention 
weights. Furthermore, it exhibited consistent performance even in the face of 
limited clinical data.
CONCLUSION: The rGAT-mGRU model has the potential to indicate sepsis prognosis 
by extracting the dynamic spatiotemporal interplay information inherent in 
multi-organ systems during critical diseases, thereby providing clinicians with 
auxiliary decision-making support.

BACKGROUND: The burden of atrial fibrillation (AF) in the intensive care unit 
(ICU) remains heavy. Glycaemic control is important in the AF management. 
Glycaemic variability (GV), an emerging marker of glycaemic control, is 
associated with unfavourable prognosis, and abnormal GV is prevalent in ICUs. 
However, the impact of GV on the prognosis of AF patients in the ICU remains 
uncertain. This study aimed to evaluate the relationship between GV and 
all-cause mortality after ICU admission at short-, medium-, and long-term 
intervals in AF patients.
METHODS: Data was obtained from the Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care 
IV 3.0 database, with admissions (2008-2019) as primary analysis cohort and 
admissions (2020-2022) as external validation cohort. Multivariate Cox 
proportional hazards models, and restricted cubic spline analyses were used to 
assess the associations between GV and mortality outcomes. Subsequently, GV and 
other clinical features were used to construct machine learning (ML) prediction 
models for 30-day all-cause mortality after ICU admission.
RESULTS: The primary analysis cohort included 8989 AF patients (age 76.5 
[67.7-84.3] years; 57.8% male), while the external validation cohort included 
837 AF patients (age 72.9 [65.3-80.2] years; 67.4% male). Multivariate Cox 
proportional hazards models revealed that higher GV quartiles were associated 
with higher risk of 30-day (Q3: HR 1.19, 95%CI 1.04-1.37; Q4: HR 1.33, 95%CI 
1.16-1.52), 90-day (Q3: HR 1.25, 95%CI 1.11-1.40; Q4: HR 1.34, 95%CI 1.29-1.50), 
and 360-day (Q3: HR 1.21, 95%CI 1.09-1.33; Q4: HR 1.33, 95%CI 1.20-1.47) 
all-cause mortality, compared with lowest GV quartile. Moreover, our data 
suggests that GV needs to be contained within 20.0%. Among all ML models, light 
gradient boosting machine had the best performance (internal validation: AUC 
[0.780], G-mean [0.551], F1-score [0.533]; external validation: AUC [0.788], 
G-mean [0.578], F1-score [0.568]).
CONCLUSION: GV is a significant predictor of ICU short-term, mid-term, and 
long-term all-cause mortality in patients with AF (the potential risk 
stratification threshold is 20.0%). ML models incorporating GV demonstrated high 
efficiency in predicting short-term mortality and GV was ranked anterior in 
importance. These findings underscore the potential of GV as a valuable 
biomarker in guiding clinical decisions and improving patient outcomes in this 
high-risk population.

Immune cells and immunity are associated with the prognosis of patients with 
critical illness. Here, medical records retrospectively extracted from the 
Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care IV were used for screening an 
immune-related biomarker in intensive care units (ICU) patients and applied for 
validating the identified indicator in septic patients. In this work, the count 
of innate immune cells, basophils, harbored a superior role in predicting ICU 
patients' prognosis compared with those of other blood immune cells (OR 0.013, 
95% CI 0.001, 0.118, P < 0.001). Importantly, basophils absence during ICU stay 
was positively correlated with the 28-day mortality of ICU patients and served 
as an independent predictor of ICU patients' prognosis (OR 3.425, 95% CI 
3.717-3.165, P < 0.001). Moreover, the association between critical illness 
progression, poor outcome, and basophils absence was verified in septic 
patients. Subsequent investigations revealed the positive relationship between 
basophils absence and immunosuppression, and suggested the potential of 
basophils-mediated immunity in predicting the 28-day mortality of ICU patients. 
Collectively, we identify basophils absence during ICU stay as a novel and 
unfavorable indicator for evaluating the prognosis of ICU patients and 
recognizing a branch of ICU patients potentially suitable for intensified 
treatment and immunoenhancement therapy.

BACKGROUND: The lactate to hematocrit ratio (LHR) has not been assessed for 
predicting all-cause death in sepsis patients. This study aims to evaluate the 
relationship between LHR and 30-day all-cause mortality in sepsis patients.
METHODS: This retrospective study used the data from Medical information mart 
for intensive care IV (MIMIC-IV, version 2.0). Our study focused on adult sepsis 
patients who were initially hospitalized in the Intensive care unit (ICU). The 
prognostic significance of admission LHR for 30-day all-cause mortality was 
evaluated using a multivariate Cox regression model, ROC curve analysis, 
Kaplan-Meier curves, and subgroup analyses.
RESULTS: A total of 3,829 sepsis patients participated in this study. Among the 
cohort, 8.5% of individuals died within of 30 days (p < 0.001). The area under 
the curve (AUC) for LHR was 74.50% (95% CI: 71.6-77.50%), higher than arterial 
blood lactate (AUC = 71.30%), hematocrit (AUC = 64.80%), and shows no 
significant disadvantage compared to qSOFA, SOFA, and SAPS II. We further 
evaluated combining LHR with qSOFA score to predict mortality in sepsis 
patients, which shows more clinical significance. ROC curve analysis showed that 
6.538 was the optimal cutoff value for survival and non-survival groups. With 
LHR ≥6.538 vs. LHR <6.538 (p < 0.001). Subgroup analysis showed significant 
interactions between LHR, age, sex, and simultaneous acute respiratory failure 
(p = 0.001-0.005).
CONCLUSION: LHR is an independent predictor of all-cause mortality in sepsis 
patients after admission, with superior predictive ability compared to blood 
lactate or hematocrit alone.

PURPOSE: Rhabdomyolysis (RM) is a complex set of clinical syndromes that 
involves the rapid dissolution of skeletal muscles. Mortality from RM is 
approximately 10%. This study aimed to develop an interpretable and 
generalizable model for early mortality prediction in RM patients.
METHOD: Retrospective analyses were performed on two electronic medical record 
databases: the eICU Collaborative Research Database and the Medical Information 
Mart for Intensive Care III database. We extracted data from the first 24 h 
after patient ICU admission. Data from the two data sets were merged for further 
analysis. The merged data sets were randomly divided, with 70% used for training 
and 30% for validation. We used the machine learning model extreme gradient 
boosting (XGBoost) with the Shapley additive explanation method to conduct early 
and interpretable predictions of patient mortality. Five typical evaluation 
indexes were adopted to develop a generalizable model.
RESULTS: In total, 938 patients with RM were eligible for this analysis. The 
area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) of the XGBoost 
model in predicting hospital mortality was 0.871, the sensitivity was 0.885, the 
specificity was 0.816, the accuracy was 0.915, and the F1 score was 0.624. The 
XGBoost model performance was superior to that of other models (logistic 
regression, AUC = 0.862; support vector machine, AUC = 0.843; random forest, AUC 
= 0.825; and naive Bayesian, AUC = 0.805) and clinical scores (Sequential Organ 
Failure Assessment, AUC = 0.747; Acute Physiology Score III, AUC = 0.721).
CONCLUSIONS: Although the XGBoost model is still not great from an absolute 
performance perspective, it provides better predictive performance than other 
models for estimating the mortality of patients with RM based on patient 
characteristics in the first 24 h of admission to the ICU.

Objective: Patients with sepsis often experience reductions or increases in 
platelet counts, but the implications of these temporal patterns on prognosis 
remain unclear. The aim of this study was to investigate the impact of changes 
in platelet trajectories on the clinical prognosis of sepsis. Methods: This 
study was a retrospective analysis using data from the Medical Information Mart 
for Intensive Care IV database. Patients with sepsis were identified from the 
database, and their platelet trajectories were categorized into four distinct 
models based on the changes in platelet counts over a period of 14 days after 
diagnosis of sepsis. The effect of these trajectories on patient prognosis was 
subsequently evaluated. Results: A total of 15,250 patients with sepsis were 
included to construct a model, and the following four distinct platelet count 
trajectories were identified: normal platelet levels (phenotype 1); persistently 
low platelet levels (phenotype 2); gradually increasing platelet levels 
exceeding the normal range (phenotype 3); and consistently significantly 
elevated platelet levels (phenotype 4). Statistically significant differences 
were found in the 28-day mortality, in-hospital mortality, and 90-day mortality 
among the four phenotypes. Multivariate regression analysis showed that compared 
to the group with normal platelet levels (phenotype 1), the group with 
persistently low platelet levels (phenotype 2) had higher in-hospital mortality 
(odds ratio [OR] = 1.34, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.16-1.54), 28-day 
mortality (OR = 1.69, 95% CI: 1.47-1.94), and 90-day mortality (OR = 1.50, 95% 
CI: 1.32-1.69). There was no difference in in-hospital mortality between 
phenotypes 3 and 4 compared to phenotype 1, although phenotype 4 showed an 
increase in 28-day mortality ( P < 0.05), and phenotype 3 showed a decreasing 
trend in 90-day mortality ( P < 0.05). The results of inverse probability 
weighting adjusted by regression were basically consistent with the above 
findings, except that there was no statistical difference in 28-day mortality 
between phenotype 4 and phenotype 1. In the subgroups based on age, weight, and 
antiplatelet drugs or therapies, there was an interaction between platelet 
levels and these factors. Conclusions: In patients with sepsis, a decrease in 
platelet count is associated with increased mortality, while a moderate increase 
in platelet count can reduce 90-day mortality. However, for patients with 
persistently elevated platelet counts, caution is advised when using 
antiplatelet drugs or therapies, as it may increase mortality.

Electronic health records (EHRs) contain critical information useful for 
clinical studies. Early assessment of patients' mortality in intensive care 
units is of great importance. In this paper, a Deep Rule-Based Fuzzy System 
(DRBFS) was proposed to develop an accurate in-hospital mortality prediction in 
the intensive care unit (ICU) patients employing a large number of input 
variables. Our main contribution is proposing a system, which is capable of 
dealing with big data with heterogeneous mixed categorical and numeric 
attributes. In DRBFS, the hidden layer in each unit is represented by 
interpretable fuzzy rules. Benefiting the strength of soft partitioning, a 
modified supervised fuzzy k-prototype clustering has been employed for fuzzy 
rule generation. According to the stacked approach, the same input space is kept 
in every base building unit of DRBFS. The training set in addition to random 
shifts, obtained from random projections of prediction results of the current 
base building unit is presented as the input of the next base building unit. A 
cohort of 10,972 adult admissions was selected from Medical Information Mart for 
Intensive Care (MIMIC-III) data set, where 9.31% of patients have died in the 
hospital. A heterogeneous feature set of first 48 h from ICU admissions, were 
extracted for in-hospital mortality rate. Required preprocessing and appropriate 
feature extraction were applied. To avoid biased assessments, performance 
indexes were calculated using holdout validation. We have evaluated our proposed 
method with several common classifiers including naïve Bayes (NB), decision 
trees (DT), Gradient Boosting (GB), Deep Belief Networks (DBN) and D-TSK-FC. The 
area under the receiver operating characteristics curve (AUROC) for NB, DT, GB, 
DBN, D-TSK-FC and our proposed method were 73.51%, 61.81%, 72.98%, 70.07%, 
66.74% and 73.90% respectively. Our results have demonstrated that DRBFS 
outperforms various methods, while maintaining interpretable rule bases. 
Besides, benefiting from specific clustering methods, DRBFS can be well scaled 
up for large heterogeneous data sets.

BACKGROUND: Sepsis is marked by a dysregulated immune response to infection. 
Calcineurin inhibitors (CNIs), commonly used as immunosuppressants, have unique 
properties that may help mitigate the overactive immune response in sepsis, 
potentially leading to better patient outcomes. This study aims to assess 
whether CNIs improve prognosis in septic patients and to evaluate any associated 
adverse reactions.
METHODS: We utilized the Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care IV 2.2 
(MIMIC-IV 2.2) database to identify septic patients who were treated with CNIs 
and those who were not. Propensity score matching (PSM) was employed to balance 
baseline characteristics between the CNI user group and the non-user group. The 
primary outcome was 28-day mortality, analyzed using the Kaplan-Meier method and 
Cox proportional hazard regression models to examine the relationship between 
CNI use and patient survival.
RESULTS: From the MIMIC-IV database, 22,517 septic patients were identified. 
After propensity score matching, a sample of 874 patients was analyzed. The CNI 
group exhibited a significantly lower 28-day mortality risk compared to the 
non-user group (HR: 0.26; 95% CI: 0.17, 0.41) in the univariate Cox hazard 
analysis. Kaplan-Meier survival curves also demonstrated a significantly higher 
28- and 365-day survival rate for CNI users compared to non-users (log-rank test 
p-value = 0.001). No significant association was found between CNI use and an 
increased risk of new-onset infection (p = 0.144), but an association with mild 
hypertension (P < 0.001) and liver injury (P < 0.001) was observed.
CONCLUSION: The use of calcineurin inhibitors was associated with reduced short- 
and long-term mortality in septic patients without an increased incidence of 
new-onset infections, hyperkalemia, severe hypertension, or acute kidney injury 
(AKI). However, CNI use may lead to adverse effects, such as liver injury and 
mild hypertension.

INTRODUCTION: Sepsis is a leading cause of death. However, there is a lack of 
useful model to predict outcome in sepsis. Herein, the aim of this study was to 
develop an explainable machine learning (ML) model for predicting 28-day 
mortality in patients with sepsis based on Sepsis 3.0 criteria.
METHODS: We obtained the data from the Medical Information Mart for Intensive 
Care (MIMIC)-III database (version 1.4). The overall data was randomly assigned 
to the training and testing sets at a ratio of 3:1. Following the application of 
LASSO regression analysis to identify the modeling variables, we proceeded to 
develop models using Extreme Gradient Boost (XGBoost), Logistic Regression (LR), 
Support Vector Machine (SVM), and Random Forest (RF) techniques with 5-fold 
cross-validation. The optimal model was selected based on its area under the 
curve (AUC). Finally, the Shapley additive explanations (SHAP) method was used 
to interpret the optimal model.
RESULTS: A total of 5,834 septic adults were enrolled, the median age was 
66 years (IQR, 54-78 years) and 2,342 (40.1%) were women. After feature 
selection, 14 variables were included for developing model in the training set. 
The XGBoost model (AUC: 0.806) showed superior performance with AUC, compared 
with RF (AUC: 0.794), LR (AUC: 0.782) and SVM model (AUC: 0.687). SHAP summary 
analysis for XGBoost model showed that urine output on day 1, age, blood urea 
nitrogen and body mass index were the top four contributors. SHAP dependence 
analysis demonstrated insightful nonlinear interactive associations between 
factors and outcome. SHAP force analysis provided three samples for model 
prediction.
CONCLUSION: In conclusion, our study successfully demonstrated the efficacy of 
ML models in predicting 28-day mortality in sepsis patients, while highlighting 
the potential of the SHAP method to enhance model transparency and aid in 
clinical decision-making.

AIM: To compare the effects of midazolam, propofol, and dexmedetomidine 
monotherapy and combination therapy on the prognosis of intensive care unit 
(ICU) patients receiving continuous mechanical ventilation (MV).
METHODS: 11,491 participants from the Medical Information Mart for Intensive 
Care (MIMIC)-IV database 2008-2019 was included in this retrospective cohort 
study. The primary outcome was defined as incidence of ventilator-associated 
pneumonia (VAP), in-hospital mortality, and duration of MV. Univariate and 
multivariate logistic regression analyses were utilized to evaluate the 
association between sedation and the incidence of VAP. Univariate and 
multivariate Cox analyses were performed to investigate the correlation between 
sedative therapy and in-hospital mortality. Additionally, univariate and 
multivariate linear analyses were conducted to explore the relationship between 
sedation and duration of MV.
RESULTS: Compared to patients not receiving these medications, propofol alone, 
dexmedetomidine alone, combination of midazolam and dexmedetomidine, combination 
of propofol and dexmedetomidine, combination of midazolam, propofol and 
dexmedetomidine were all association with an increased risk of VAP; 
dexmedetomidine alone, combination of midazolam and dexmedetomidine, combination 
of propofol and dexmedetomidine, combination of midazolam, propofol and 
dexmedetomidine may be protective factor for in-hospital mortality, while 
propofol alone was risk factor. There was a positive correlation between all 
types of tranquilizers and the duration of MV. Taking dexmedetomidine alone as 
the reference, all other drug groups were found to be associated with an 
increased risk of in-hospital mortality. The administration of propofol alone, 
in combination with midazolam and dexmedetomidine, in combination with propofol 
and dexmedetomidine, in combination with midazolam, propofol and dexmedetomidine 
were associated with an increased risk of VAP compared to the use of 
dexmedetomidine alone.
CONCLUSION: Dexmedetomidine alone may present as a favorable prognostic option 
for ICU patients with mechanical ventilation MV.

BACKGROUND: Abdominal perfusion pressure (APP) is a salient feature in the 
design of a prognostic model for patients with intra-abdominal hypertension 
(IAH). However, incomplete data significantly limits the size of the beneficiary 
patient population in clinical practice. Using advanced artificial intelligence 
methods, the authors developed a robust mortality prediction model with APP from 
incomplete data.
METHODS: The authors retrospectively evaluated the patients with IAH from the 
Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care IV (MIMIC-IV) database. Incomplete 
data were filled in using generative adversarial imputation nets (GAIN). Lastly, 
demographic, clinical, and laboratory findings were combined to build a 7-day 
mortality prediction model.
RESULTS: The authors included 1354 patients in this study, of which 63 features 
were extracted. Data imputation with GAIN achieved the best performance. 
Patients with an APP <60 mmHg had significantly higher all-cause mortality 
within 7-90 days. The difference remained significant in long-term survival even 
after propensity score matching (PSM) eliminated other mortality risks between 
groups. Lastly, the built machine learning model for 7-day modality prediction 
achieved the best results with an AUC of 0.80 in patients with confirmed IAH 
outperforming the other four traditional clinical scoring systems.
CONCLUSIONS: APP reduction is an important survival predictor affecting the 
survival prognosis of patients with IAH. The authors constructed a robust model 
to predict the 7-day mortality probability of patients with IAH, which is 
superior to the commonly used clinical scoring systems.

BACKGROUND: Atrial fibrillation (AF) is a common cardiac arrhythmia. The ratio 
of red cell distribution width (RDW) to albumin has been recognized as a 
reliable prognostic marker for poor outcomes in a variety of diseases. However, 
the evidence regarding the association between RDW to albumin ratio (RAR) and in 
hospital mortality in patients with AF admitted to the Intensive Care Unit (ICU) 
currently was unclear. The purpose of this study was to explore the association 
between RAR and in hospital mortality in patients with AF in the ICU.
METHODS: This retrospective cohort study used data from the Medical Information 
Mart for Intensive Care IV (MIMIC-IV) database for the identification of 
patients with atrial fibrillation (AF). The primary endpoint investigated was 
in-hospital mortality. Multivariable-adjusted Cox regression analysis and forest 
plots were utilized to evaluate the correlation between the RAR and in-hospital 
mortality among patients with AF admitted to ICU. Additionally, receiver 
operating characteristic (ROC) curves were conducted to assess and compare the 
predictive efficacy of RDW and the RAR.
RESULTS: Our study included 4,584 patients with AF with a mean age of 
75.1 ± 12.3 years, 57% of whom were male. The in-hospital mortality was 20.3%. 
The relationship between RAR and in-hospital mortality was linear. The Cox 
proportional hazard model, adjusted for potential confounders, found a high RAR 
independently associated with in hospital mortality. For each increase of 1 unit 
in RAR, there is a 12% rise in the in-hospital mortality rate (95% CI 
1.06-1.19). The ROC curves revealed that the discriminatory ability of the RAR 
was better than that of RDW. The area under the ROC curves (AUCs) for RAR and 
RDW were 0.651 (95%CI: 0.631-0.671) and 0.599 (95% CI: 0.579-0.620).
CONCLUSIONS: RAR is independently correlated with in hospital mortality and in 
AF. High level of RAR is associated with increased in-hospital mortality rates.

BACKGROUND: Advances in artificial intelligence (AI) have realized the potential 
of revolutionizing healthcare, such as predicting disease progression via 
longitudinal inspection of Electronic Health Records (EHRs) and lab tests from 
patients admitted to Intensive Care Units (ICU). Although substantial literature 
exists addressing broad subjects, including the prediction of mortality, 
length-of-stay, and readmission, studies focusing on forecasting Acute Kidney 
Injury (AKI), specifically dialysis anticipation like Continuous Renal 
Replacement Therapy (CRRT) are scarce. The technicality of how to implement AI 
remains elusive.
OBJECTIVE: This study aims to elucidate the important factors and methods that 
are required to develop effective predictive models of AKI and CRRT for patients 
admitted to ICU, using EHRs in the Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care 
(MIMIC) database.
METHODS: We conducted a comprehensive comparative analysis of established 
predictive models, considering both time-series measurements and clinical notes 
from MIMIC-IV databases. Subsequently, we proposed a novel multi-modal model 
which integrates embeddings of top-performing unimodal models, including Long 
Short-Term Memory (LSTM) and BioMedBERT, and leverages both unstructured 
clinical notes and structured time series measurements derived from EHRs to 
enable the early prediction of AKI and CRRT.
RESULTS: Our multimodal model achieved a lead time of at least 12 h ahead of 
clinical manifestation, with an Area Under the Receiver Operating Characteristic 
Curve (AUROC) of 0.888 for AKI and 0.997 for CRRT, as well as an Area Under the 
Precision Recall Curve (AUPRC) of 0.727 for AKI and 0.840 for CRRT, 
respectively, which significantly outperformed the baseline models. 
Additionally, we performed a SHapley Additive exPlanation (SHAP) analysis using 
the expected gradients algorithm, which highlighted important, previously 
underappreciated predictive features for AKI and CRRT.
CONCLUSION: Our study revealed the importance and the technicality of applying 
longitudinal, multimodal modeling to improve early prediction of AKI and CRRT, 
offering insights for timely interventions. The performance and interpretability 
of our model indicate its potential for further assessment towards clinical 
applications, to ultimately optimize AKI management and enhance patient 
outcomes.

BACKGROUND: The incidence of nonhip femoral fractures is gradually increasing, 
but few studies have explored the risk factors for in-hospital death in patients 
with nonhip femoral fractures in the ICU or developed mortality prediction 
models. Therefore, we chose to study this specific patient group, hoping to help 
clinicians improve the prognosis of patients.
METHODS: This is a retrospective study based on the data from the Medical 
Information Mart for Intensive Care IV (MIMIC-IV) database. Least absolute 
shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) regression was used to screen risk 
factors. The receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve was drawn, and the 
areas under the curve (AUC), net reclassification index (NRI) and integrated 
discrimination improvement (IDI) were calculated to evaluate the discrimination 
of the model. The consistency between the actual probability and the predicted 
probability was assessed by the calibration curve and Hosmer-Lemeshow goodness 
of fit test (HL test). Decision curve analysis (DCA) was performed, and the 
nomogram was compared with the scoring system commonly used in clinical practice 
to evaluate the clinical net benefit.
RESULTS: The LASSO regression analysis showed that heart rate, temperature, red 
blood cell distribution width, blood urea nitrogen, Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS), 
Simplified Acute Physiology Score II (SAPSII), Charlson comorbidity index and 
cerebrovascular disease were independent risk factors for in-hospital death in 
patients with nonhip femoral fractures. The AUC, IDI and NRI of our model in the 
training set and validation set were better than those of the GCS and SAPSII 
scoring systems. The calibration curve and HL test results showed that our model 
prediction results were in good agreement with the actual results (P = 0.833 for 
the HL test of the training set and P = 0.767 for the HL test of the validation 
set). DCA showed that our model had a better clinical net benefit than the GCS 
and SAPSII scoring systems.
CONCLUSION: In this study, the independent risk factors for in-hospital death in 
patients with nonhip femoral fractures were determined, and a prediction model 
was constructed. The results of this study may help to improve the clinical 
prognosis of patients with nonhip femoral fractures.

BACKGROUND: Acute kidney injury (AKI) is an important complication in critically 
ill patients, especially in sepsis and septic shock patients. Early prediction 
of AKI in septic shock can provide clinicians with sufficient information for 
timely intervention so that improve the patients' survival rate and quality of 
life. The aim of this study was to establish a nomogram that predicts the risk 
of AKI in patients with septic shock in the intensive care unit (ICU).
METHODS: The data were collected from the Medical Information Mart for Intensive 
Care III (MIMIC-III) database between 2001 and 2012. The primary outcome was AKI 
in the 48 h following ICU admission. Univariate and multivariate logistic 
regression analyses were used to screen the independent risk factors of AKI. The 
performance of the nomogram was evaluated according to the calibration curve, 
receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve, decision curve analysis, and 
clinical impact curve.
RESULTS: A total of 2415 patients with septic shock were included in this study. 
In the training and validation cohort, 1091 (64.48%) of 1690 patients and 475 
(65.52%) of 725 patients developed AKI, respectively. The predictive factors for 
nomogram construction were gender, ethnicity, congestive heart failure, 
diabetes, obesity, Simplified Acute Physiology Score II (SAPS II), 
angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEI) or angiotensin receptor blockers 
(ARBs), bilirubin, creatinine, blood urea nitrogen (BUN), and mechanical 
ventilation. The model had a good discrimination with the area under the ROC 
curve of 0.756 and 0.760 in the training and validation cohorts, respectively. 
The calibration curve for probability of AKI in septic shock showed optimal 
agreement between prediction by nomogram and actual observation. Decision curve 
and clinical impact curve analysis indicated that the nomogram conferred high 
clinical net benefit.
CONCLUSION: The proposed nomogram can quickly and effectively predict the risk 
of AKI at an early stage in patients with septic shock in ICU, which can provide 
information for timely and efficient intervention in patients with septic shock 
in the ICU setting.

BACKGROUND: Renal replacement therapy (RRT) plays a crucial role in managing 
acute pancreatitis (AP). This study aimed to develop and evaluate predictive 
models for determining the need for RRT among patients with AP in the intensive 
care unit (ICU).
METHODS: A retrospective selection of patients with AP was made from the Medical 
Information Mart for Intensive Care IV (MIMIC-IV, version V2.0). The cohort was 
randomly divided into a training set (447 patients) and a validation set (150 
patients). The least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) 
regression cross-validation method was utilized to identify key features for 
model construction. Using these features, four machine learning (ML) algorithms 
were developed. The optimal model was visualized and clarified using SHapley 
Additive exPlanations (SHAP) and presented as a nomogram.
RESULTS: The mean age of the cohort was 59.17 years, with an average Acute 
Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation II (APACHE II) score of 17.55. Acute 
kidney injury (AKI) was observed in 52.43% of patients with AP, and 9.05% 
required RRT. After feature selection, four of 41 clinical factors were 
ultimately chosen for use in model construction. The Lasso-Logistic Regression 
(Lasso-LR) model showed a high discriminative ability to predict RRT risk in 
patients with AP, with an area under the receiver operating characteristic 
(AUROC) of 0.955 (95% CI 0.924-0.987) in the training set. In the validation 
set, it maintained its discriminative performance, achieving an AUROC of 0.985 
(95% CI 0.970-1.000). Calibration curves indicated an excellent fit in both sets 
(Brier scores: 0.039 and 0.032, respectively), suggesting high consistency. 
Decision curve analysis (DCA) highlighted the Lasso-LR model's significant 
clinical utility in predicting RRT likelihood in patients with AP.
CONCLUSIONS: Developed via the LASSO regression cross-validation method, the 
Lasso-LR model significantly excels in predicting the requirement for RRT in 
patients with AP, demonstrating its potential for clinical application.

OBJECTIVES: This study aimed to determine the relationship between the body mass 
index (BMI) and short-term mortality of patients with intra-abdominal infection 
(IAI) using the Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care (MIMIC-III) 
database.
DESIGN: Retrospective cohort study.
SETTING: Adult intensive care units (ICUs) at a tertiary hospital in the USA .
PARTICIPANTS: Adult IAI ICU patients from 2001 to 2012 in the MIMIC-III 
database.
INTERVENTIONS: In univariate analysis, we compared the differences in the 
characteristics of patients in each BMI group. Cox regression models were used 
to evaluate the relationships between BMI and short-term prognosis.
PRIMARY AND SECONDARY OUTCOME MEASURES: 90-day survival.
RESULTS: In total, 1161 patients with IAI were included. There were 399 (34.4%) 
patients with a normal BMI (<25 kg/m2), 357 (30.8%) overweight patients 
(25-30 kg/m2) and 405 (34.9%) obese patients (>30 kg/m2) who tended to be 
younger (p<0.001) and had higher Sequential Organ Failure Assessment scores 
(p<0.05). The mortality of obese patients at 90 days was lower than that of 
patients with a normal BMI (20.74% vs 23.25%, p<0.05), but their length of stay 
in the ICU was higher (4.9 days vs 3.6 days, p<0.001); however, their rate of 
mechanical ventilation utilisation was higher (61.48% vs 56.86%, p<0.05). In the 
Cox regression model, we also confirmed that BMI was a protective factor in 
patients with IAIs, and the adjusted mortality rate of patients with a higher 
BMI was 0.97 times lower than that of patients with a lower BMI (p<0.001, 
HR=0.97, 95% CI 0.96 to 0.99).
CONCLUSIONS: IAI patients with an overweight or obese status might have lower 
90-day mortality than patients with a normal BMI.

BACKGROUND: Sepsis is often accompanied by organ dysfunction and acute organ 
failure, among which the liver is commonly involved. Sepsis patients suffering 
from liver injury have a greater risk of mortality than patients suffering from 
general sepsis. As of now, there are no tools that are specifically designed for 
assessing the prognosis of such patients. This study aimed to develop and 
validate a model to predict the risk of in-hospital mortality in patients with 
sepsis-associated liver injury (SALI).
METHODS: Data were obtained from the Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care 
(MIMIC)-IV database. In the analysis, all patients with SALI who met the 
inclusion and exclusion criteria were included. A primary outcome was 
in-hospital mortality, and clinical data were extracted for these patients. In a 
ratio of 8:2, the data were divided into training and validation groups at 
random. Least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) regression was 
used for data dimension reduction and feature selection, and independent factors 
related to prognosis were identified through multi-factor logistics analysis. A 
nomogram was developed to visualize the model, and the performance of the model 
was evaluated by the area under the curve (AUC) as well as calibration and 
decision curve analysis (DCA) through internal verification.
RESULTS: A total of 616 and 154 patients with SALI were included in the training 
and validation cohorts, respectively. The LASSO regression and logistic 
multivariate analysis showed that nine factors were associated with in-hospital 
mortality in patients with SALI. Both the training and validation cohorts had 
higher AUCs than sequential organ failure assessment (SOFA) and simplified acute 
physiology score 2 (SAPS2): 0.753 (95% CI: 0.715-0.791) and 0.783 (95% CI: 
0.749-0.817), respectively. Both the training and validation cohorts showed good 
calibration results for the prediction model. In terms of clinical 
practicability, DCA of the predictive model demonstrated greater net benefits 
than the SOFA and SAPS2 scores.
CONCLUSIONS: We developed a predictive model that can effectively predict the 
in-hospital mortality of SALI patients, with satisfactory performance and 
clinical practicability. This model can assist clinicians in the early 
identification of high-risk patients and provide a reference for clinical 
treatment strategies.

INTRODUCTION: Dysnatremia is strongly associated with poor prognosis in acute 
kidney injury (AKI); however, the impact of sodium trajectories on the prognosis 
of patients with AKI has not yet been well elucidated. This study aimed to 
assess the association between sodium trajectories in patients with AKI and 
mortality at 30-day and 1-year follow-up.
METHODS: This retrospective cohort study used data from Medical Information Mart 
for Intensive Care (MIMIC)-IV database, and patients diagnosed with AKI within 
48 h after admission were enrolled. Group-based trajectory models (GBTM) were 
applied to map the developmental course of the serum sodium fluctuations. 
Kaplan-Meier survival curve was used to compare differences in mortality in AKI 
patients with distinct serum sodium trajectories. Hazard ratios (HRs) were 
calculated to determine the association between trajectories and prognosis using 
Cox proportional hazard models.
RESULTS: A total of 9,314 AKI patients were enrolled. Three distinct sodium 
trajectories were identified including: (i) stable group (ST, in which the serum 
sodium levels remained relatively stable, n = 4,935; 53.0%), (ii) descending 
group (DS, in which the serum sodium levels declined, n = 2,994; 32.15%) and 
(iii) ascending group (AS, in which the serum sodium levels were elevated, 
n = 1,383; 14.85%). There was no significant difference in age and gender 
distribution among the groups. The 30-day mortality rates were 7.9% in ST, 9.5% 
in DS and 16.6% in AS (p < 0.001). The results of 1-year mortality rates were 
similar (p < 0.001). In adjusted analysis, patients in the DS (HR = 1.22, 95% 
confidence interval [CI], 1.04-1.43, p = 0.015) and AS (HR = 1.68, 95% CI, 
1.42-2.01, p = 0.013) groups had higher risks of 30-day mortality compared to 
those in the ST group.
CONCLUSION: In patients with AKI, the serum sodium trajectories were 
independently associated with 30-day and 1-year mortality. Association between 
serum sodium level trajectories and prognosis in patients with AKI deserve 
further study.

Paralytic Ileus (PI) patients in the Intensive Care Unit (ICU) face a 
significant risk of death. Current predictive models for PI are often complex 
and rely on many variables, resulting in unreliable outcomes for such a serious 
health condition. Predicting mortality in ICU patients with PI is particularly 
challenging due to the vast amount of data and numerous features involved. To 
address this issue, a deep-learning predictive framework was developed using the 
Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care IV (MIMIC-IV) dataset, which 
includes data from 1017 ICU patients with PI. By employing SHAP (SHapley 
Additive exPlanations) analysis, we were able to narrow down the features to six 
distinct clinical lab items. The proposed framework, called DLMP (Deep Learning 
Model for Mortality Prediction of ICU Patients with PI), utilizes these six 
unique clinical lab items: Anion gap, Platelet, PTT, BUN, Total Bilirubin, and 
Bicarbonate, along with one demographic variable as inputs to a neural network 
consisting of only two neuron layers. DLMP achieved an outstanding prediction 
performance with an AUC score of 0.887, outperforming existing predictive models 
for ICU patients with PI. The DLMP framework significantly enhances the 
prediction of mortality for PI patients compared to traditional process mining 
and machine learning models. This model holds considerable potential for 
prognosis, enabling families to be better informed about the severity of a 
patient's condition and to prepare accordingly. Furthermore, the model is 
valuable for research purposes and clinical trials.

BACKGROUND: The identification of efficient predictors for short-term mortality 
among patients with myocardial infarction (MI) in coronary care units (CCU) 
remains a challenge. This study seeks to investigate the potential of machine 
learning (ML) to improve risk prediction and develop a predictive model 
specifically tailored for 30-day mortality in critical MI patients.
METHOD: This study focused on MI patients extracted from the Medical Information 
Mart for Intensive Care-IV database. The patient cohort was randomly stratified 
into derivation (n = 1,389, 70%) and validation (n = 595, 30%) groups. 
Independent risk factors were identified through eXtreme Gradient Boosting 
(XGBoost) and random decision forest (RDF) methodologies. Subsequently, 
multivariate logistic regression analysis was employed to construct predictive 
models. The discrimination, calibration and clinical utility were assessed 
utilizing metrics such as receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve, 
calibration plot and decision curve analysis (DCA).
RESULT: A total of 1,984 patients were identified (mean [SD] age, 69.4 [13.0] 
years; 659 [33.2%] female). The predictive performance of the XGBoost and 
RDF-based models demonstrated similar efficacy. Subsequently, a 30-day mortality 
prediction algorithm was developed using the same selected variables, and a 
regression model was visually represented through a nomogram. In the validation 
group, the nomogram (Area Under the Curve [AUC]: 0.835, 95% Confidence Interval 
[CI]: [0.774-0.897]) exhibited superior discriminative capability for 30-day 
mortality compared to the Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (SOFA) score [AUC: 
0.735, 95% CI: (0.662-0.809)]. The nomogram (Accuracy: 0.914) and the SOFA score 
(Accuracy: 0.913) demonstrated satisfactory calibration. DCA indicated that the 
nomogram outperformed the SOFA score, providing a net benefit in predicting 
mortality.
CONCLUSION: The ML-based predictive model demonstrated significant efficacy in 
forecasting 30-day mortality among MI patients admitted to the CCU. The 
prognostic factors identified were age, blood urea nitrogen, heart rate, pulse 
oximetry-derived oxygen saturation, bicarbonate, and metoprolol use. This model 
serves as a valuable decision-making tool for clinicians.

OBJECTIVE: Risk stratification of patients with congestive heart failure (HF) is 
vital in clinical practice. The aim of this study was to construct a machine 
learning model to predict the in-hospital all-cause mortality for intensive care 
unit (ICU) patients with HF.
METHODS: eXtreme Gradient Boosting algorithm (XGBoost) was used to construct a 
new prediction model (XGBoost model) from the Medical Information Mart for 
Intensive Care IV database (MIMIC-IV) (training set). The eICU Collaborative 
Research Database dataset (eICU-CRD) was used for the external validation (test 
set). The XGBoost model performance was compared with a logistic regression 
model and an existing model (Get with the guideline-Heart Failure model) for 
mortality in the test set. Area under the receiver operating characteristic cure 
and Brier score were employed to evaluate the discrimination and the calibration 
of the three models. The SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) value was applied 
to explain XGBoost model and calculate the importance of its features.
RESULTS: The total of 11,156 and 9,837 patients with congestive HF from the 
training set and test set, respectively, were included in the study. In-hospital 
all-cause mortality occurred in 13.3% (1,484/11,156) and 13.4% (1,319/9,837) of 
patients, respectively. In the training set, of 17 features with the highest 
predictive value were selected into the models with LASSO regression. Acute 
Physiology Score III (APS III), age and Sequential Organ Failure Assessment 
(SOFA) were strongest predictors in SHAP. In the external validation, the 
XGBoost model performance was superior to that of conventional risk predictive 
methods, with an area under the curve of 0.771 (95% confidence interval, 
0.757-0.784) and a Brier score of 0.100. In the evaluation of clinical 
effectiveness, the machine learning model brought a positive net benefit in the 
threshold probability of 0%-90%, prompting evident competitiveness compare to 
the other two models. This model has been translated into an online calculator 
which is accessible freely to the public 
(https://nkuwangkai-app-for-mortality-prediction-app-a8mhkf.streamlit.app).
CONCLUSION: This study developed a valuable machine learning risk stratification 
tool to accurately assess and stratify the risk of in-hospital all-cause 
mortality in ICU patients with congestive HF. This model was translated into a 
web-based calculator which access freely.

OBJECTIVES: We aimed to investigate the association between the 
albumin-corrected anion gap (ACAG) and the prognosis of cardiogenic shock (CS).
DESIGN: A multicentre retrospective cohort study.
SETTING: Data were collected from the Medical Information Mart for Intensive 
Care (MIMIC-IV) and eICU Collaborative Research Database (eICU-CRD) datasets.
PARTICIPANTS: 808 and 700 individuals from the MIMIC-IV and eICU-CRD, 
respectively, who were diagnosed with CS.
PRIMARY AND SECONDARY OUTCOMES: The primary endpoint was short-term all-cause 
mortality, including intensive care unit (ICU), in-hospital and 28-day 
mortality. The secondary endpoints were the 28-day free from the ICU duration 
and the length of ICU stay.
RESULTS: CS patients were divided into two groups according to the admission 
ACAG value: the normal ACAG group (≤20 mmol/L) and the high ACAG group (> 
20 mmol/L). CS patients with higher ACAG values exhibited increased short-term 
all-cause mortality rates, including ICU mortality (MIMIC-IV cohort: adjusted 
HR: 1.43, 95% CI=1.05-1.93, p=0.022; eICU-CRD cohort: adjusted HR: 1.38, 95% 
CI=1.02-1.86, p=0.036), in-hospital mortality (MIMIC-IV cohort: adjusted HR: 
1.31, 95% CI=1.01-1.71, p=0.03; eICU-CRD cohort: adjusted HR: 1.47, 95% 
CI=1.12-1.94, p=0.006) and 28-day mortality (adjusted HR: 1.42, 95% CI: 1.11 to 
1.83, p=0.007). A positive linear correlation was observed between the ACAG 
value and short-term mortality rates via restricted cubic splines. Compared with 
the AG, the ACAG presented a larger area under the curve for short-term 
mortality prediction. In addition, the duration of intensive care was longer, 
whereas the 28-day free from the ICU duration was shorter in patients with a 
higher ACAG value in both cohorts.
CONCLUSION: The ACAG value was independently and strongly associated with the 
prognosis of patients with CS, indicating that the ACAG value is superior to the 
conventional AG value.

BACKGROUND: Acute kidney injury (AKI) in patients with acute myocardial 
infarction (AMI) often indicates a poor prognosis.
OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to investigate the association between the TyG index 
and the risk of AKI in patients with AMI.
METHODS: Data were taken from the Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care 
(MIMIC) database. A 1:3 propensity score (PS) was set to match patients in the 
AKI and non-AKI groups. Multivariate logistic regression analysis, restricted 
cubic spline (RCS) regression and subgroup analysis were performed to assess the 
association between TyG index and AKI.
RESULTS: Totally, 1831 AMI patients were included, of which 302 (15.6%) had AKI. 
The TyG level was higher in AKI patients than in non-AKI patients 
(9.30 ± 0.71 mg/mL vs. 9.03 ± 0.73 mg/mL, P < 0.001). Compared to the lowest 
quartile of TyG levels, quartiles 3 or 4 had a higher risk of AKI, respectively 
(Odds Ratiomodel 4 = 2.139, 95% Confidence Interval: 1.382-3.310, for quartile 4 
vs. quartile 1, Ptrend < 0.001). The risk of AKI increased by 34.4% when the TyG 
level increased by 1 S.D. (OR: 1.344, 95% CI: 1.150-1.570, P < 0.001). The TyG 
level was non-linearly associated with the risk of AKI in the population within 
a specified range. After 1:3 propensity score matching, the results were similar 
and the TyG level remained a risk factor for AKI in patients with AMI.
CONCLUSION: High levels of TyG increase the risk of AKI in AMI patients. The TyG 
level is a predictor of AKI risk in AMI patients, and can be used for clinical 
management.

OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to investigate the risk factors for intensive care 
unit (ICU) mortality in patients with intracerebral hemorrhage after surgery and 
to construct a clinical nomogram.
METHODS: The data in this retrospetive analysis were acquired from the Medical 
Information Mart for Intensive Care IV database, and the study controls were 
randomly divided into training and validation subsets in a ratio of 7:3. The 
primary clinical endpoint was all-cause ICU mortality. The prediction model was 
developed and a nomogram was generated based on findings of the logistic 
regression and least absolute shrinkage and selection operator regression 
analyses. Receiver operating characteristic curve was employed to assess model 
performance, and decision curve analysis was used to assess the clinical utility 
of the nomogram.
RESULTS: This retrospective study comprised 859 participants, of whom 757 were 
survivors and 102 were nonsurvivors. The results showed that red cell 
distribution width (P = 0.014), Glucose (P < 0.001), mechanical ventilation ≥48 
hours (P < 0.001), acute respiratory failure (P = 0.019), and Sequential Organ 
Failure Assessment (P = 0.017) were independent risk factors for death after 
intracerebral hemorrhage surgery. The results of the nomogram showed that blood 
glucose and red cell distribution width had the greatest impact on prognosis. 
The nomogram demonstrated strong discriminating for all-cause mortality in the 
ICU and showed a positive net benefit across a broad spectrum of threshold 
probabilities.
CONCLUSIONS: For patients with severe cerebral hemorrhage after craniotomy, we 
developed a distinctive nomogram model to forecast all-cause mortality in the 
critical care unit. It can simply and intuitively display the risk of poor 
prognosis for patients, providing clinicians with an important treatment tool 
for individualized treatment and outcome forecasting.

AIMS: Hemoglobin glycation index (HGI) is closely associated with adverse 
outcomes in several diseases. However, few studies have investigated the 
correlation between HGI and prognosis in patients with critical ischemic stroke.
METHODS: A cohort of patients was established from the Medical Information Mart 
for Intensive Care IV (MIMIC-IV) database. Kaplan-Meier analysis, multivariate 
regression models, and restricted cubic splines (RCS) were used to investigate 
the associations between HGI and different outcomes. Mediation models were 
constructed to determine the mediating role of white blood cell (WBC) counts.
RESULTS: This study included 2,332 participants. In-hospital mortality differs 
significantly across HGI groups (24.43 %, 11.82 %, and 10.14 %, P < 0.001). 
Multivariate regression analyses found that lower HGI was significantly 
associated with greater mortality risk. Nonlinear analyses revealed an L-shaped 
association between HGI and short-term mortality (30-day and in-hospital), while 
a reverse J-shaped relationship emerged for long-term (365-day) mortality. 
Mediation analysis revealed that WBC counts mediated the association with 
proportions (%) of 33.73, 19.65, and 30.00, respectively.
CONCLUSION: Lower HGI is consistently related to poorer outcomes in patients 
with critical ischemic stroke. Higher HGI could be a protective factor in the 
short term but might increase mortality risk in the long term. WBC counts 
significantly mediate the association.

Pan-immune inflammation value (PIV) is associated with prognosis in immune and 
inflammatory diseases, and inflammation is a hallmark of pulmonary embolism 
(PE). Nonetheless, the link between PIV and prognosis in PE remains unclear. 
However, few studies have specifically focused on critically ill patients with 
PE in ICUs. This study retrospectively analyzed electronic health data of 
patients with PE from the Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care (MIMIC-IV) 
database. The primary outcome was 28-day ACM; secondary outcomes were 90-day, 
1-year, ICU, and in-hospital mortality. The study population included 213 
patients with PE. Multivariate Cox proportional hazards regression showed that 
elevated PIV was significantly associated with ACM at 28 days (adjusted hazard 
ratio [aHR]: 1.93; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.02-3.63) and 90 days (aHR: 
1.96; 95% CI: 1.10-3.47). Further, multivariate logistic regression analysis 
showed that PIV was significantly and positively associated with the risk of 
ACM. Kaplan-Meier survival curves showed that PIV was positively associated with 
ACM. Subgroup and interaction analyses corroborated this correlation. PIV was 
significantly correlated with ACM in critically ill ICU patients with PE. This 
correlation highlights the potential utility of PIV for stratifying patients 
with PE according to their risk of death.

Acute kidney injury (AKI) is one of the common complications of pulmonary 
infections. However, nomograms predicting the risk of early-onset AKI in 
patients with pulmonary infections have not been comprehensively researched. In 
this study, 3278 patients with pulmonary infection were extracted from the 
Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care III (MIMIC-III) database. These 
patients were randomly divided into training and validation cohorts, with the 
training cohort used for model building and the validation cohort used for 
validation. Independent risk factors for patients with pulmonary infection were 
determined using the least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) 
method and forward stepwise logistic regression, which revealed that 11 
independent risk factors for AKI in patients with pulmonary infections were 
congestive heart failure (CHF), hypertension, diabetes, transcutaneous oxygen 
saturation (SpO2), 24-h urine output, white blood cells (WBC), serum creatinine 
(Scr), prothrombin time (PT), potential of hydrogen (PH), vasopressor use, and 
mechanical ventilation (MV) use. The nomogram was then constructed and 
validated. The area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) 
values of the nomogram were 0.770 (95% CI = 0.789-0.807) in the training cohort 
and 0.724 (95% CI = 0.754-0.784) in the validation cohort. High AUC values 
indicated the good discriminative ability of the nomogram, while the calibration 
curves and Hosmer-Lemeshow test results indicated that the nomogram was 
well-calibrated. Improvements in net reclassification index (NRI) and integrated 
discrimination improvement (IDI) values indicate that our nomogram was superior 
to the Simplified Acute Physiology Score (SAPS) II scoring system, and the 
decision-curve analysis (DCA) curves indicate that the nomogram has good 
clinical application. We established a risk-prediction model for AKI in patients 
with pulmonary infection, which has good discriminative power and is superior to 
the SAPS II scoring system. This model can provide clinical reference 
information for patients with this type of disease in the intensive care unit.

OBJECTIVE: Platelet (PLT) engages in immune and inflammatory responses, all of 
which are related to the prognosis of critically ill patients. Although 
thrombocytopenia at ICU admission contributes to in-hospital mortality, PLT is 
repeatedly measured during ICU hospitalization and the role of longitudinal PLT 
trajectory remains unclear. We aimed to identify dynamic PLT trajectory patterns 
and evaluate their relationships with mortality risk and thrombocytopenia.
METHODS: We adopted a three-phase, multi-cohort study strategy. Firstly, 
longitudinal PLT trajectory patterns within the first four ICU days and their 
associations with 28-day survival were tested in the eICU Collaborative Research 
Database (eICU-CRD) and independently validated in the Medical Information Mart 
for Intensive Care IV (MIMIC-IV) database. Secondly, the relationships among PLT 
trajectory patterns, thrombocytopenia, and 28-day mortality were explored and 
validated. Finally, a Mortality GRade system for ICU dynamically monitoring 
patients (Mortality-GRID) was developed to quantify the mortality risk based on 
longitudinal PLT, which was further validated in the Molecular Epidemiology of 
Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (MEARDS) cohort.
RESULTS: A total of 35,332 ICU patients were included from three cohorts. 
Trajectory analysis clustered patients into ascending (AS), stable (ST), or 
descending (DS) PLT patterns. DS patients with high baseline PLT decline 
quickly, resulting in poor prognosis. AS patients have low baseline PLT but 
recover quickly, favoring a better prognosis. ST patients maintain low PLT, 
having a moderate prognosis in between (HR ST vs AS = 1.26, 95% CI: 1.14-1.38, P 
= 6.15 × 10-6; HR DS vs AS = 1.58, 95% CI: 1.40-1.79, P = 1.41 × 10-13). The 
associations remained significant in patients without thrombocytopenia during 
the entire ICU hospitalization and were robust in sensitivity analyses and 
stratification analyses. Further, the trajectory pattern was a warning sign of 
thrombocytopenia, which mediated 27.2% of the effects of the PLT trajectory on 
28-day mortality (HR indirect = 1.11, 95% CI: 1.06-1.17, P = 9.80 × 10-6). 
Mortality-GRID well predicts mortality risk, which is in high consistency with 
that directly estimated in MEARDS (r = 0.98, P = 1.30 × 10-23).
CONCLUSION: Longitudinal PLT trajectory is a complementary predictor to baseline 
PLT for patient survival, even in patients without risk of thrombocytopenia. 
Mortality-GRID could identify patients at high mortality risk.

BACKGROUND: Predictive models based on machine learning have been widely used in 
clinical practice. Patients with acute myocardial infarction (AMI) are prone to 
the risk of acute kidney injury (AKI), which results in a poor prognosis for the 
patient. The aim of this study was to develop a machine learning predictive 
model for the identification of AKI in AMI patients.
METHODS: Patients with AMI who had been registered in the Medical Information 
Mart for Intensive Care (MIMIC) III and IV database were enrolled. The primary 
outcome was the occurrence of AKI during hospitalization. We developed Random 
Forests (RF) model, Naive Bayes (NB) model, Support Vector Machine (SVM) model, 
eXtreme Gradient Boosting (xGBoost) model, Decision Trees (DT) model, and 
Logistic Regression (LR) models with AMI patients in MIMIC-IV database. The 
importance ranking of all variables was obtained by the SHapley Additive 
exPlanations (SHAP) method. AMI patients in MIMIC-III databases were used for 
model evaluation. The area under the receiver operating characteristic curve 
(AUC) was used to compare the performance of each model.
RESULTS: A total of 3,882 subjects with AMI were enrolled through screening of 
the MIMIC database, of which 1,098 patients (28.2%) developed AKI. We randomly 
assigned 70% of the patients in the MIMIC-IV data to the training cohort, which 
is used to develop models in the training cohort. The remaining 30% is allocated 
to the testing cohort. Meanwhile, MIMIC-III patient data performs the external 
validation function of the model. 3,882 patients and 37 predictors were included 
in the analysis for model construction. The top 5 predictors were serum 
creatinine, activated partial prothrombin time, blood glucose concentration, 
platelets, and atrial fibrillation, (SHAP values are 0.670, 0.444, 0.398, 0.389, 
and 0.381, respectively). In the testing cohort, using top 20 important 
features, the models of RF, NB, SVM, xGBoost, DT model, and LR obtained AUC of 
0.733, 0.739, 0.687, 0.689, 0.663, and 0.677, respectively. Placing RF models of 
number of different variables on the external validation cohort yielded their 
AUC of 0.711, 0.754, 0.778, 0.781, and 0.777, respectively.
CONCLUSION: Machine learning algorithms, particularly the random forest 
algorithm, have improved the accuracy of risk stratification for AKI in AMI 
patients and are applied to accurately identify the risk of AKI in AMI patients.

This study aimed to establish and validate a machine learning (ML) model for 
predicting in-hospital mortality in patients with sepsis-associated acute kidney 
injury (SA-AKI). This study collected data on SA-AKI patients from 2008 to 2019 
using the Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care IV. After employing Lasso 
regression for feature selection, six ML approaches were used to build the 
model. The optimal model was chosen based on precision and area under curve 
(AUC). In addition, the best model was interpreted using SHapley Additive 
exPlanations (SHAP) values and Local Interpretable Model-Agnostic Explanations 
(LIME) algorithms. There were 8129 sepsis patients eligible for participation; 
the median age was 68.7 (interquartile range: 57.2-79.6) years, and 57.9% 
(4708/8129) were male. After selection, 24 of the 44 clinical characteristics 
gathered after intensive care unit admission remained linked with prognosis and 
were utilized developing ML models. Among the six models developed, the eXtreme 
Gradient Boosting (XGBoost) model had the highest AUC, at 0.794. According to 
the SHAP values, the sequential organ failure assessment score, respiration, 
simplified acute physiology score II, and age were the four most influential 
variables in the XGBoost model. Individualized forecasts were clarified using 
the LIME algorithm. We built and verified ML models that excel in early 
mortality risk prediction in SA-AKI and the XGBoost model performed best.

To improve the performance of Intensive Care Units (ICUs), the field of 
bio-statistics has developed scores which try to predict the likelihood of 
negative outcomes. These help evaluate the effectiveness of treatments and 
clinical practice, and also help to identify patients with unexpected outcomes. 
However, they have been shown by several studies to offer sub-optimal 
performance. Alternatively, Deep Learning offers state of the art capabilities 
in certain prediction tasks and research suggests deep neural networks are able 
to outperform traditional techniques. Nevertheless, a main impediment for the 
adoption of Deep Learning in healthcare is its reduced interpretability, for in 
this field it is crucial to gain insight into the why of predictions, to assure 
that models are actually learning relevant features instead of spurious 
correlations. To address this, we propose a deep multi-scale convolutional 
architecture trained on the Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care III 
(MIMIC-III) for mortality prediction, and the use of concepts from coalitional 
game theory to construct visual explanations aimed to show how important these 
inputs are deemed by the network. Results show our model attains a ROC AUC of 
0.8735 (± 0.0025) which is competitive with the state of the art of Deep 
Learning mortality models trained on MIMIC-III data, while remaining 
interpretable. Supporting code can be found at

INTRODUCTION: This study aimed to develop and validate an interpretable 
machine-learning model based on clinical features for early predicting 
in-hospital mortality in critically ill patients with sepsis.
METHODS: We enrolled all patients with sepsis in the Medical Information Mart 
for Intensive Care IV (MIMIC-IV, v.1.0) database from 2008 to 2019. Lasso 
regression was used for feature selection. Seven machine-learning methods were 
applied to develop the models. The best model was selected based on its accuracy 
and area under curve (AUC) in the validation cohort. Furthermore, we employed 
the SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) method to illustrate the effects of the 
features attributed to the model, and to analyze how the individual features 
affect the output of the model, and to visualize the Shapley value for a single 
individual.
RESULTS: In total, 8,817 patients with sepsis were eligible for participation, 
the median age was 66.8 years (IQR, 55.9-77.1 years), and 3361 of 8817 
participants (38.1%) were women. After selection, 25 of a total 57 clinical 
parameters collected on day 1 after ICU admission remained associated with 
prognosis and were used for developing the machine-learning models. Among seven 
constructed models, the eXtreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost) model achieved the 
best performance with an AUC of 0.884 and an accuracy of 89.5% in the validation 
cohort. Feature importance analysis showed that Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) score, 
blood urea nitrogen, respiratory rate, urine output, and age were the top 5 
features of the XGBoost model with the greatest impact. Furthermore, SHAP force 
analysis illustrated how the constructed model visualized the individualized 
prediction of death.
CONCLUSIONS: We have demonstrated the potential of machine-learning approaches 
for predicting outcome early in patients with sepsis. The SHAP method could 
improve the interpretability of machine-learning models and help clinicians 
better understand the reasoning behind the outcome.

BACKGROUND: While serum Ca has proven to be a reliable predictor of mortality 
across various diseases, its connection with the clinical outcomes of ischemic 
stroke (IS) remains inconclusive. Our research aimed to explore the 
relationships between serum total Ca (tCa) and serum ionized Ca (iCa) and 
mortality among acute IS (AIS) patients.
METHODS: We gathered data from 1773 AIS patients in the Medical Information Mart 
for Intensive Care Database IV, including baseline demographic data, 
comorbidities, vital signs, laboratory-based data, and scoring systems. 
Endpoints for the study encompassed 30-d, 90-d, and 365-d all-cause mortalities. 
Employing restricted cubic spline Cox regression, we explored potential 
nonlinear relationships between admission serum iCa and tCa levels and 
mortality. Participants were categorized into four groups based on serum iCa and 
tCa quartiles. Multivariable Cox regression analysis was then conducted to 
evaluate the independent association of iCa and tCa quartiles with all-cause 
mortality.
RESULTS: The restricted cubic spline revealed a U-shaped association between iCa 
and 30-d and 90-d mortality (P<0.05), while the relationship between iCa and 
365-d mortality was linear (P<0.05). After adjusting for confounders, 
multivariable Cox analysis demonstrated that the lowest serum iCa level quartile 
was independently associated with increased risks of 30-d, 90-d, and 365-d 
mortality. Similarly, the highest serum iCa level quartile was independently 
associated with increased risks of 30-d and 90-d mortality, but not 365-d 
mortality. Notably, serum tCa level showed no association with increased risks 
of 30-d, 90-d, and 365-d mortality.
CONCLUSIONS: Our findings suggest that serum iCa, rather than tCa, is linked to 
ischemic stroke prognosis. Both high and low serum iCa levels are associated 
with poor short-term prognosis, while only low serum iCa is associated with poor 
long-term prognosis in AIS patients.

BACKGROUND: Acute myocardial infarction (AMI) is one of the most severe 
cardiovascular diseases and is associated with a high risk of in-hospital 
mortality. However, the current deep learning models for in-hospital mortality 
prediction lack interpretability.
OBJECTIVE: This study aims to establish an explainable deep learning model to 
provide individualized in-hospital mortality prediction and risk factor 
assessment for patients with AMI.
METHODS: In this retrospective multicenter study, we used data for consecutive 
patients hospitalized with AMI from the Chongqing University Central Hospital 
between July 2016 and December 2022 and the Electronic Intensive Care Unit 
Collaborative Research Database. These patients were randomly divided into 
training (7668/10,955, 70%) and internal test (3287/10,955, 30%) data sets. In 
addition, data of patients with AMI from the Medical Information Mart for 
Intensive Care database were used for external validation. Deep learning models 
were used to predict in-hospital mortality in patients with AMI, and they were 
compared with linear and tree-based models. The Shapley Additive Explanations 
method was used to explain the model with the highest area under the receiver 
operating characteristic curve in both the internal test and external validation 
data sets to quantify and visualize the features that drive predictions.
RESULTS: A total of 10,955 patients with AMI who were admitted to Chongqing 
University Central Hospital or included in the Electronic Intensive Care Unit 
Collaborative Research Database were randomly divided into a training data set 
of 7668 (70%) patients and an internal test data set of 3287 (30%) patients. A 
total of 9355 patients from the Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care 
database were included for independent external validation. In-hospital 
mortality occurred in 8.74% (670/7668), 8.73% (287/3287), and 9.12% (853/9355) 
of the patients in the training, internal test, and external validation cohorts, 
respectively. The Self-Attention and Intersample Attention Transformer model 
performed best in both the internal test data set and the external validation 
data set among the 9 prediction models, with the highest area under the receiver 
operating characteristic curve of 0.86 (95% CI 0.84-0.88) and 0.85 (95% CI 
0.84-0.87), respectively. Older age, high heart rate, and low body temperature 
were the 3 most important predictors of increased mortality, according to the 
explanations of the Self-Attention and Intersample Attention Transformer model.
CONCLUSIONS: The explainable deep learning model that we developed could provide 
estimates of mortality and visual contribution of the features to the prediction 
for a patient with AMI. The explanations suggested that older age, unstable 
vital signs, and metabolic disorders may increase the risk of mortality in 
patients with AMI.

This study aims to investigate the association between the triglyceride-glucose 
(TyG) index and the occurrence of acute respiratory failure in asthma patients. 
This retrospective observational cohort study utilized data from the Medical 
Information Mart for Intensive Care IV (MIMIC-IV 2.2) database. The primary 
outcome was the development of acute respiratory failure in asthma patients. 
Initially, the Boruta algorithm and SHapley Additive exPansions were applied to 
preliminarily determine the feature importance of the TyG index, and a risk 
prediction model was constructed to evaluate its predictive ability. Secondly, 
Logistic regression proportional hazards models were employed to assess the 
association between the TyG index and acute respiratory failure in asthma 
patients. Finally, subgroup analyses were conducted for sensitivity analyses to 
explore the robustness of the results. A total of 751 asthma patients were 
included in the study. When considering the TyG index as a continuous variable, 
logistic regression analysis revealed that in the unadjusted Model 1, the odds 
ratio (OR) was 2.381 (95% CI: 1.857-3.052; P < 0.001), in Model II, the OR was 
2.456 (95% CI: 1.809-3.335; P < 0.001), and in the multivariable-adjusted model, 
the OR was 1.444 (95% CI: 1.029-2.028; P = 0.034). A consistent association was 
observed between the TyG index and the risk of acute respiratory failure in 
asthma patients. No significant interaction was found between the TyG index and 
various subgroups (P > 0.05). Furthermore, machine learning results indicated 
that an elevated TyG index was a significant feature predictive of respiratory 
failure in asthma patients. The baseline risk model achieved an AUC of 0.743 
(95% CI: 0.679-0.808; P < 0.05), whereas the combination of the baseline risk 
model with the TyG index yielded an AUC of 0.757 (95% CI: 0.694-0.821; 
P < 0.05). The TyG index can serve as a predictive indicator for acute 
respiratory failure in asthma patients, albeit confirmation of these findings 
requires larger-scale prospective studies.

BACKGROUND: Surgical aortic valve replacement (SAVR) currently stands as a 
primary surgical intervention for addressing aortic valve disease in patients. 
This retrospective study focused on the role of the red blood cell distribution 
width (RDW) in predicting adverse outcomes among SAVR patients.
METHODS: The subjects for this study were exclusively derived from the Medical 
Information Mart for Intensive Care database (MIMIC IV 2.0). Kaplan‒Meier (K-M) 
curves and Cox proportional hazards regression models were employed to assess 
the correlation between RDW, one-year mortality, and postoperative atrial 
fibrillation (POAF). The smooth-fitting curves were used to observe the relative 
risk (RR) of RDW in one-year mortality and POAF. Furthermore, time-dependent 
receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves, the continuous-net 
reclassification index (NRI), and integrated discrimination improvement (IDI) 
were employed for comprehensive assessment of the prognostic value of RDW.
RESULTS: Analysis of RDW revealed a distinctive inverted U-shaped relationship 
with one-year mortality, while its association with POAF appeared nearly linear. 
Cox multiple regression models showed that RDW > 14.35%, along with preoperative 
potassium concentration and perioperative red blood cell transfusion, were 
significantly linked to one-year mortality (K-M curves, log-rank P < 0.01). 
Additionally, RDW was associated with both POAF and prolonged hospital stays (P 
< 0.05). There was no significant difference in length of stay in ICU. Notably, 
the inclusion of RDW in the predictive models substantially enhanced its 
performance. This was evidenced by the time-dependent ROC curve (AUC = 0.829), 
NRI (P< 0.05), IDI (P< 0.05), and K-M curves (log-rank P< 0.01).
CONCLUSIONS: RDW serves as a robust prognostic indicator for SAVR patients, 
offering a novel means of anticipating adverse postoperative events.

BACKGROUND: Although blood glucose changes have been suggested to be a potential 
better target for clinical control than baseline blood glucose levels, the 
association of blood glucose changes with the prognosis in acute myocardial 
infarction (AMI) patients with diabetes mellitus (DM) is unclear. Herein, this 
study aimed to investigate association of short-term longitudinal trajectory of 
blood glucose with 30-day mortality in this population.
METHODS: Data of AMI patients with DM were extracted from the Medical 
Information Mart for Intensive Care (MIMIC) database in 2003-2019 in this 
retrospective cohort study. The latent growth mixture modeling (LGMM) model was 
utilized to classify the 24-hour longitudinal trajectory of blood glucose of the 
patients. Kaplan-Meier (KM) curve was drawn to show 30-day mortality risk in 
patients with different trajectory classes. Univariate and multivariate Cox 
regression analyses were employed to explore the association of longitudinal 
trajectory of blood glucose within 24 hours after the ICU admission with 30-day 
mortality. Also, subgroups analysis of age, gender, and AMI types was performed. 
The evaluation indexes were hazard ratios (HRs) and 95% confidence intervals 
(CIs).
RESULTS: Among 1,523 eligible patients, 227 (14.9%) died within 30 days. We 
identified 4 longitudinal trajectories of blood glucose, including class 1 (a 
low initial average blood glucose level with steady trend within 24 hours), 
class 2 (a high initial average blood glucose with gently decreased trend), 
class 3 (the highest initial average blood glucose with rapidly decreased trend) 
and class 4 (a high initial average blood glucose level with the trend that 
increased at first and then decreased). After adjusting for covariates, an 
average blood glucose level of ≥200 mg/dL was linked to higher risk of 30-day 
mortality, comparing to that of <140 mg/dL (HR = 1.80, 95%CI: 1.23-2.63). 
Comparing to patients whose longitudinal trajectory of blood glucose conformed 
to class 1, those with class 2 (HR = 2.52, 95%CI: 1.79-3.53) or class 4 (HR = 
3.53, 95%CI: 2.07-6.03) seemed to have higher risk of 30-day mortality. 
Additionally, these associations were also significant in aged ≥60 years old, 
female, male, NSTEMI, and STEMI subgroups (all P<0.05).
CONCLUSION: A low level of average blood glucose at the ICU admission or 
reducing blood glucose to a normal level quickly with adequate measures in 24 
hours after ICU admission may be beneficial for AMI patients with DM to reduce 
the risk of 30-day mortality. These findings may provide some information for 
further exploration on appropriate range of blood glucose changes in clinical 
practice.

AIMS: This study endeavors to explore the ramifications of early dynamic blood 
glucose (BG) trajectories within the initial 48 h of intensive care unit (ICU) 
admission on mortality among critically ill heart failure (HF) patients.
METHODS: The study employed a retrospective observational design, analyzing 
dynamic BG data of HF patients from the Medical Information Mart for Intensive 
Care IV database. The BG trajectory subphenotypes were identified using the 
hierarchical clustering based on the dynamic time-warping algorithm. The primary 
outcome of the study was 28-day mortality, with secondary outcomes including 
180-day and 1-year mortality.
RESULTS: We screened a total of 21,098 HF patients and finally 15,092 patients 
were included in the study. Our results identified three distinct BG trajectory 
subphenotypes: increasing (n = 3503), stabilizing (n = 6250), and decreasing 
(n = 5339). The increasing subphenotype was associated with the highest 
mortality risk at 28 days, 180 days, and 1 year. The stabilizing and decreasing 
subphenotypes showed significantly lower mortality risks across all time points, 
with hazard ratios ranging from 0.85 to 0.88 (P<0.05 for all). Sensitivity 
analyses confirmed the robustness of these findings after adjusting for various 
covariates.
CONCLUSIONS: Increasing BG trajectory within 48 h of admission is significantly 
associated with higher mortality in patients with HF. It is necessary to devote 
greater attention to the early BG dynamic changes in HF patients to optimize 
clinical BG management and enhance patient prognosis.

OBJECTIVE: Early prediction of long-term outcomes in patients with systemic 
lupus erythematosus (SLE) remains a great challenge in clinical practice. Our 
study aims to develop and validate predictive models for the mortality risk.
METHODS: This observational study identified patients with SLE requiring 
hospital admission from the Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care 
(MIMIC-IV) database. We downloaded data from Fujian Provincial Hospital as an 
external validation set. Variable selection was performed using the Least 
Absolute Shrinkage and Selection Operator (LASSO) regression. Then, we 
constructed two predictive models: a traditional nomogram based on logistic 
regression and a machine learning model employing a stacking ensemble approach. 
The predictive ability of the models was evaluated by the areas under the 
receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) and the calibration curve.
RESULTS: A total of 395 patients and 100 patients were enrolled respectively 
from MIMIC-IV database and the validation cohort. The LASSO regression 
identified 18 significant variables. Both models demonstrated good 
discrimination, with AUCs above 0.8. The machine learning model outperformed the 
nomogram in terms of precision and specificity, highlighting its potential 
superiority in risk prediction. The SHapley additive explanations analysis 
further elucidated the contribution of each variable to the model's predictions, 
emphasising the importance of factors such as urine output, age, weight and 
alanine aminotransferase.
CONCLUSIONS: The machine learning model provides a superior tool for predicting 
mortality risk in patients with SLE, offering a basis for clinical 
decision-making and potential improvements in patient outcomes.

Background: Acute ischemic stroke is a leading cause of death in the United 
States. Identifying patients with stroke at high risk of mortality is crucial 
for timely intervention and optimal resource allocation. This study aims to 
develop and validate machine learning-based models to predict in-hospital 
mortality risk for intensive care unit (ICU) patients with acute ischemic stroke 
and identify important associated factors. Methods: Our data include 3,489 acute 
ischemic stroke admissions to the ICU for patients not discharged or dead within 
48 h from the Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care-IV (MIMIC-IV) 
database. Demographic, hospitalization type, procedure, medication, intake 
(intravenous and oral), laboratory, vital signs, and clinical assessment [e.g., 
Glasgow Coma Scale Scores (GCS)] during the initial 48 h of admissions were used 
to predict in-hospital mortality after 48 h of ICU admission. We explored 3 
machine learning models (random forests, logistic regression, and XGBoost) and 
applied Bayesian optimization for hyperparameter tuning. Important features were 
identified using learned coefficients. Results: Experiments show that XGBoost 
tuned for area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC ROC) was 
the best performing model (AUC ROC 0.86, F1 0.52), compared to random forests 
(AUC ROC 0.85, F1 0.47) and logistic regression (AUC ROC 0.75, F1 0.40). Top 
features include GCS, blood urea nitrogen, and Richmond RASS score. The model 
also demonstrates good fairness for males versus females and across 
racial/ethnic groups. Conclusions: Machine learning has shown great potential in 
predicting in-hospital mortality risk for people with acute ischemic stroke in 
the ICU setting. However, more ethical considerations need to be applied to 
ensure that performance differences across different racial/ethnic groups will 
not exacerbate existing health disparities and will not harm historically 
marginalized populations.

OBJECTIVE: To explore the relationship between serum calcium levels and the 
prognosis of severe acute osteomyelitis, and to assess the effectiveness of 
calcium levels in prognostic evaluation.
METHODS: Relevant patient records of individuals diagnosed with severe acute 
osteomyelitis were obtained for this retrospective study from the Medical 
Information Mart for Intensive Care (MIMIC-IV). The study aimed to assess the 
impact of different indicators on prognosis by utilizing COX regression 
analysis. To enhance prognostic prediction for critically ill patients, a 
nomogram was developed. The discriminatory capacity of the nomogram was 
evaluated using the Area Under the Curve (AUC) of the Receiver Operating 
Characteristic (ROC) curve, in addition to the calibration curve.
RESULT: The study analyzed a total of 1,133 cases of severe acute osteomyelitis, 
divided into the survivor group (1,025 cases) and the non-survivor group (108 
cases). Significant differences were observed between the two groups in terms of 
age, hypertension, sepsis, renal injury, and various laboratory indicators, 
including WBC, PLT, Ca2+, CRP, hemoglobin, albumin, and creatinine (P<0.05). 
However, no significant differences were found in race, gender, marital status, 
detection of wound microbiota, blood sugar, lactate, and ALP levels. A 
multivariate COX proportional hazards model was constructed using age, 
hypertension, sepsis, Ca2+, creatinine, albumin, and hemoglobin as variables. 
The results revealed that hypertension and sepsis had a significant impact on 
survival time (HR=0.514, 95% CI 0.339-0.779, P=0.002; HR=1.696, 95% CI 
1.056-2.723, P=0.029). Age, hemoglobin, Ca2+, albumin, and creatinine also 
showed significant effects on survival time (P<0.05). However, no statistically 
significant impact on survival time was observed for the other variables 
(P>0.05). To predict the survival time, a nomogram was developed using the 
aforementioned indicators and achieved an AUC of 0.841. The accuracy of the 
nomogram was further confirmed by the ROC curve and calibration curve.
CONCLUSION: According to the findings, this study establishes that a reduction 
in serum calcium levels serves as a distinct and standalone predictor of 
mortality among individuals diagnosed with severe acute osteomyelitis during 
their stay in the Intensive Care Unit (ICU) within a span of two years.

BACKGROUND: Pulmonary embolism (PE) is a disease caused by blood clots, tumor 
embolism, and other emboli within the pulmonary arteries. Various scoring scales 
are used for PE. One such same is the PESI, but it has 12 variables, making it 
inconvenient for clinical application.
OBJECTIVES: The aim of this study was to develop a new simple nomogram model to 
assess 30-day survival in PE patients. The new nomogram makes it easier and 
faster for clinicians to assess the prognosis of patients with PE.
METHODS: We collected data about the patients with PE from the Medical 
Information Mart for Intensive Care-III (MIMIC-III) database and used the 
receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve, area under the ROC curve (AUROC), 
calibration plot, integrated discrimination improvement (IDI), and decision 
curve analysis (DCA) to evaluate the predictive power of the new model, and 
compared these with the PESI.
RESULTS: According to the multivariable Cox regression model results, alongside 
the actual clinical conditions, we included the following seven variables: race, 
bicarbonate, age, tumor, systolic blood pressure (SBP), body temperature, and 
oxygen saturation (Spo2). The AUROC of the new model was greater than 0.70. Its 
IDI exceeded 0, but with P-value>0.05.
CONCLUSION: The predictive performance of the new model was not worse than the 
PESI, but the new model only has seven variables, and is therefore more 
convenient for clinicians to use.

BACKGROUND: The prognosis is poor when acute pancreatitis (AP) progresses to 
sepsis; therefore, it is necessary to accurately predict the probability of 
sepsis and develop a personalized treatment plan to reduce the disease burden of 
AP patients.
METHODS: A total of 1295 patients with AP and 43 variables were extracted from 
the Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care (MIMIC) IV database. The 
included patients were randomly assigned to the training set and to the 
validation set at a ratio of 7 : 3. The chi-square test or Fisher's exact test 
was used to test the distribution of categorical variables, and Student's t-test 
was used for continuous variables. Multivariate logistic regression was used to 
establish a prognostic model for predicting the occurrence of sepsis in AP 
patients. The indicators to verify the overall performance of the model included 
the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC), calibration 
curves, the net reclassification improvement (NRI), the integrated 
discrimination improvement (IDI), and a decision curve analysis (DCA).
RESULTS: The multifactor analysis results showed that temperature, phosphate, 
calcium, lactate, the mean blood pressure (MBP), urinary output, Glasgow Coma 
Scale (GCS), Charlson Comorbidity Index (CCI), sodium, platelet count, and 
albumin were independent risk factors. All of the indicators proved that the 
prediction performance and clinical profitability of the newly established 
nomogram were better than those of other common indicators (including SIRS, 
BISAP, SOFA, and qSOFA).
CONCLUSIONS: The new risk-prediction system that was established in this 
research can accurately predict the probability of sepsis in patients with acute 
pancreatitis, and this helps clinicians formulate personalized treatment plans 
for patients. The new model can reduce the disease burden of patients and can 
contribute to the reasonable allocation of medical resources, which is 
significant for tertiary prevention.

The association between the red blood cell distribution width-platelet ratio 
(RPR) and mortality in heart failure patients remains unclear. We aimed to 
investigate the potential non-linear relationship between RPR and 1-year 
mortality risk. A retrospective cohort study was conducted involving 6982 
participants from the Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care IV (MIMIC-IV) 
database. Multivariable Cox regression and restricted cubic spline analyses were 
performed to evaluate the association between RPR and 1-year mortality, 
adjusting for potential confounders. We observed 1091 patients died in hospital 
and 2535 patients died during 1 year follow-up period. The prevalence or 
incidence of mortality did not show statistically significant differences among 
RPR groups in the overall study population. However, a positive association 
between RPR and the risk of mortality was noted after adjusting for multiple 
variables (HR = 1.38, 95 % CI = 1.06-1.81, P = 0.018). Analysis using restricted 
cubic splines indicated a U-shaped relationship between RPR levels and the risk 
of mortality (P nonlinearity <0.05), with the point of lowest risk at 0.104. 
Compared to this level, lower RPR (<0.104) was associated with increased 
mortality (HR = 0.046, 95 % CI: 0.004-0.546), as was higher RPR (>0.104) 
(HR = 2.656, 95 % CI: 1.692-4.170).This U-shaped association was consistent 
across subgroup analyses (all interaction P values > 0.05). RPR exhibits a 
U-shaped association with 1-year mortality in heart failure patients, suggesting 
both low and high RPR levels are linked to increased risk. RPR may serve as a 
relevant biomarker for risk stratification in this population. We incorporated 
RPR into the SOFA (AUC 0.731) and SAPS II (AUC 0.746) models, which 
significantly improved their predictive ability for in-hospital mortality. For 
1-year mortality prediction, RPR + SAPS II (AUC 0.683) showed significantly 
improved accuracy, while RPR + SOFA (AUC 0.626) did not improve significantly.

Chronic heart failure (CHF) poses a significant threat to human health. The 
stress hyperglycemia ratio (SHR) is a novel metric for accurately assessing 
stress hyperglycemia, which has been correlated with adverse outcomes in various 
major diseases. However, it remains unclear whether SHR is associated with 
28-day mortality in patients with pre-existing CHF who were admitted to 
intensive care units (ICUs). This study retrospectively recruited patients who 
were admitted to ICUs with both acute critical illness and pre-existing CHF from 
the Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care (MIMIC) database. 
Characteristics were compared between the survival and non-survival groups. The 
relationship between SHR and 28-day all-cause mortality was analyzed using 
restricted cubic splines, receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves, 
Kaplan-Meier survival analysis, and Cox proportional hazards regression 
analysis. The importance of the potential risk factors was assessed using the 
Boruta algorithm. Prediction models were constructed using machine learning 
algorithms. A total of 913 patients were enrolled. The risk of 28-day mortality 
increased with higher SHR levels (P < 0.001). SHR was independently associated 
with 28-day all-cause mortality, with an unadjusted hazard ratio (HR) of 1.45 
(P < 0.001) and an adjusted HR of 1.43 (P < 0.001). Subgroup analysis found that 
none of the potential risk factors, such as demographics, comorbidities, and 
drugs, affected the relationship (P for interaction > 0.05). The area under the 
ROC (AUC) curve for SHR was larger than those for admission blood glucose and 
HbA1c; the cut-off for SHR was 0.57. Patients with SHR higher than the cut-off 
had a significantly lower 28-day survival probability (P < 0.001). SHR was 
identified as one of the key factors for 28-day mortality by the Boruta 
algorithm. The predictive performance was verified through four machine learning 
algorithms, with the neural network algorithm being the best (AUC 0.801). For 
patients with both acute critical illness and pre-existing CHF, SHR was an 
independent predictor of 28-day all-cause mortality. Its prognostic performance 
surpasses those of HbA1c and blood glucose, and prognostic models based on SHR 
provide clinicians with an effective tool to make therapeutic decisions.

BACKGROUND: Heart failure (HF) combined with diabetes is highly prevalent and is 
associated with more severe left ventricular dysfunction and a higher mortality 
rate. Early prediction of prognosis in such patients is crucial. This study aims 
to investigate the relationship between the lactate-to-albumin ratio (LAR) and 
outcomes in critically ill patients diagnosed with HF and diabetes.
METHODS: Data on critically ill HF patients with diabetes were retrospectively 
collected from the Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care IV (MIMIC-IV) 
database. Restricted cubic spline (RCS) analysis identified a threshold value of 
0.44, dividing patients into low-LAR (< 0.44) and high-LAR (≥ 0.44) groups. 
Least Absolute Shrinkage and Selection Operator (LASSO) regression with tenfold 
cross-validation identified variables associated with mortality. RCS, 
Kaplan-Meier curves, and Cox regression analyses were employed to evaluate the 
association between LAR and mortality. Subgroup analyses were conducted to 
validate the robustness of the findings.
RESULTS: A total of 3,774 patients were included, with a determined LAR cutoff 
value of 0.44. RCS analysis revealed a positive correlation between LAR and 
all-cause mortality at 90 days, 180 days, and 1 year. Cox regression analysis 
showed that both low-LAR and high-LAR groups were independent risk factors for 
all-cause mortality at 90 days, 180 days, and 1 year in HF patients with 
diabetes (P < 0.05). Kaplan-Meier survival curves demonstrated that the 
cumulative survival rates at 90 days, 180 days, and 1 year were lower in the 
low-LAR group compared to the high-LAR group. Subgroup analyses confirmed the 
stability of the association between LAR and all-cause mortality at all time 
points.
CONCLUSION: In summary, LAR is a reliable and independent predictor of increased 
mortality in critically ill HF patients with diabetes. However, additional 
comprehensive prospective studies are needed to validate these findings.

BACKGROUND: We aimed to use the Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care III 
database to build a nomogram to identify 30-day mortality risk of deep vein 
thrombosis (DVT) patients in intensive care unit (ICU).
METHODS: Stepwise logistic regression and logistic regression with least 
absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) were used to fit two 
prediction models. Bootstrap method was used to perform internal validation.
RESULTS: We obtained baseline data of 535 DVT patients, 91 (17%) of whom died 
within 30 days. The discriminations of two new models were better than 
traditional scores. Compared with simplified acute physiology score II (SAPSII), 
the predictive abilities of two new models were improved (Net reclassification 
improvement [NRI] > 0; Integrated discrimination improvement [IDI] > 0; 
P < 0.05). The Brier scores of two new models in training set were 0.091 and 
0.108. After internal validation, corrected area under the curves for two models 
were 0.850 and 0.830, while corrected Brier scores were 0.108 and 0.114. The 
more concise model was chosen to make the nomogram.
CONCLUSIONS: The nomogram developed by logistic regression with LASSO model can 
provide an accurate prognosis for DVT patients in ICU.

Background: Identifying high-risk patients with acute pulmonary embolism is 
vital for improving disease prognosis. However, current guidelines and research 
on risk factors are insufficient to meet clinical needs. This study was aimed at 
exploring novel risk factors to predict in-hospital mortality. Methods: We 
utilized a patient cohort from the Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care 
Version IV (MIMIC-IV) database as training cohort. Major analyses included 
screening risk factors for in-hospital mortality, correlation analysis via 
smooth curve fitting, multivariate Cox regression, and subgroup analysis. The 
findings were further validated with our own institute patient cohort. Results: 
Among 1463 adult patients with acute pulmonary embolism in the MIMIC-IV 
database, the overall in-hospital mortality rate was 17.8%. A nonlinear 
correlation was observed between urine output and in-hospital mortality. A urine 
discharge less than 0.85 mL/kg/h was used as the threshold and was negatively 
associated with the risk for in-hospital death. Compared to patients with 
urine value < 0.5 mL/kg/h, the risk for in-hospital mortality reduced by 36% and 
48% in patients with urine values of 0.5-0.85 mL/kg/h and > 0.85 mL/kg/h, with 
the hazard ratios of 0.64 (0.47, 0.87) and 0.52 (0.38, 0.72), respectively. This 
association remained significant in the subgroup analysis after adjusting for 
age, gender, hypotension, and low oxygen saturation. Our validation patient 
cohort (n = 151) further confirmed the strong association of the urine value 
with in-hospital mortality and consistent cutoff value. Conclusion: Our study 
revealed a negative association of urine output with in-hospital mortality in 
acute pulmonary embolism patients, with the optimal urine output being 
significantly higher than the value of other critical illnesses.

OBJECTIVE: The Acute Disease Quality Initiative (ADQI) working group recently 
released a consensus definition of sepsis-associated acute kidney injury 
(SA-AKI), but the prognosis and risk factors for early and late SA-AKI have not 
been studied.
METHODS: This was a retrospective cohort study based on the Medical Information 
Mart for Intensive Care IV (MIMIC-IV) database (v2.2). First, SA-AKI patients 
that met the new definition from the ADQI were screened, and then, the 
relationships between SA-AKI occurrence time and relevant clinical parameters 
were analyzed.
RESULTS: After propensity score matching, 1,090 early SA-AKI (AKI occurring 
within 48 h of sepsis diagnosis) cases and late SA-AKI (AKI occurring between 
48 h and 7 days after sepsis diagnosis) cases were identified. Compared with 
late SA-AKI patients, early SA-AKI patients had no significant differences in 
all-cause mortality at 28 days, 60 days or 180 days, renal replacement therapy 
(RRT) rates; or major adverse kidney events at 30 days (MAKE-30). However, the 
renal recovery of early SA-AKI patients was significantly better than that of 
late SA-AKI patients, their lengths of hospital stay and intensive care unit 
stay were significantly shorter, and the number of patients with positive fluid 
balance was lower, but the use of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) 
and nephrotoxic antibiotics and the incidence of septic shock were higher. In 
addition, there was a difference in the number of patients with early and late 
SA-AKI at highest AKI stages 1 and 3. Data analysis also revealed that liver 
disease, cancer, highest AKI stage 3 and septic shock were associated with renal 
nonrecovery.
CONCLUSIONS: Although there was no significant difference in mortality between 
early and late SA-AKI patients, there were significant differences in renal 
recovery, positive fluid balance, nephrotoxic antibiotic use, septic shock and 
AKI stage. Therefore, the classification of early and late SA-AKI has certain 
scientific and rational validity, but whether the two have different clinical 
outcomes and pathogeneses requires further study.

BACKGROUND: Traditional scoring systems for patients' outcome prediction in 
intensive care units such as Oxygenation Saturation Index (OSI) and Oxygenation 
Index (OI) may not reliably predict the clinical prognosis of patients with 
acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). Thus, none of them have been widely 
accepted for mortality prediction in ARDS. This study aimed to develop and 
validate a mortality prediction method for patients with ARDS based on machine 
learning using the Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care (MIMIC-III) and 
Telehealth Intensive Care Unit (eICU) Collaborative Research Database (eICU-CRD) 
databases.
METHODS: Patients with ARDS were selected based on the Berlin definition in 
MIMIC-III and eICU-CRD databases. The APPS score (using age, PaO2/FiO2, and 
plateau pressure), Simplified Acute Physiology Score II (SAPS-II), 
Sepsis-related Organ Failure Assessment (SOFA), OSI, and OI were calculated. 
With MIMIC-III data, a mortality prediction model was built based on the random 
forest (RF) algorithm, and the performance was compared to those of existing 
scoring systems based on logistic regression. The performance of the proposed RF 
method was also validated with the combined MIMIC-III and eICU-CRD data. The 
performance of mortality prediction was evaluated by using the area under the 
receiver operating characteristics curve (AUROC) and performing calibration 
using the Hosmer-Lemeshow test.
RESULTS: With the MIMIC-III dataset (308 patients, for comparisons with the 
existing scoring systems), the RF model predicted the in-hospital mortality, 
30-day mortality, and 1-year mortality with an AUROC of 0.891, 0.883, and 0.892, 
respectively, which were significantly higher than those of the SAPS-II, APPS, 
OSI, and OI (all P<0.001). In the multi-source validation (the combined dataset 
of 2,235 patients in MIMIC-III and 331 patients in eICU-CRD), the RF model 
achieved an AUROC of 0.905 and 0.736 for predicting in-hospital mortality for 
the MIMIC-III and eICU-CRD datasets, respectively. The calibration plots 
suggested good fits for our RF model and these scoring systems for predicting 
mortality. The platelet count and lactate level were the strongest predictive 
variables for predicting in-hospital mortality.
CONCLUSIONS: Compared to the existing scoring systems, machine learning 
significantly improved performance for predicting ARDS mortality. Validation 
with multi-source datasets showed a relatively robust generalisation ability of 
our prediction model.

BACKGROUND: Sepsis has a high mortality rate, which is expensive to treat, and 
is a major drain on healthcare resources; it seriously impacts the quality of 
human life. The clinical features of positive or non-positive blood cultures 
have been reported, but the clinical features of sepsis with different microbial 
infections and how they contribute to clinical outcomes have not been adequately 
described.
METHODS: We extracted clinical data of septic patients with a single pathogen 
from the online Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care(MIMIC)-IV database. 
Based on microbial cultures, patients were classified into Gram-negative, 
Gram-positive, and fungal groups. Then, we analyzed the clinical characteristics 
of sepsis patients with Gram-negative, Gram-positive, and fungal infections. The 
primary outcome was 28-day mortality. The secondary outcomes were in-hospital 
mortality, the length of hospital stay, the length of ICU stay, and the 
ventilation duration. In addition, Kaplan-Meier analysis was used for the 28-day 
cumulative survival rate of patients with sepsis. Finally, we performed further 
univariate and multivariate regression analyses for 28-day mortality and created 
a nomogram for predicting 28-day mortality.
RESULTS: The analysis showed that bloodstream infections showed a statistically 
significant difference in survival between Gram-positive and fungal organisms; 
drug resistance only reached statistical significance for Gram-positive 
bacteria. Through univariate and multivariate analysis, it was found that both 
the Gram-negative bacteria and fungi were independent risk factors for the 
short-term prognosis of sepsis patients. The multivariate regression model 
showed good discrimination, with a C-index of 0.788. We developed and validated 
a nomogram for the individualized prediction of 28-day mortality in patients 
with sepsis. Application of the nomogram still gave good calibration.
CONCLUSIONS: Organism type of infection is associated with mortality of sepsis, 
and early identification of the microbiological type of a patient with sepsis 
will provide an understanding of the patient's condition and guide treatment.

BACKGROUND: Sepsis-associated acute kidney injury (SA-AKI) is a severe 
complication associated with poorer prognosis and increased mortality, 
particularly in elderly patients. Currently, there is a lack of accurate 
mortality risk prediction models for these patients in clinic.
OBJECTIVES: This study aimed to develop and validate machine learning models for 
predicting in-hospital mortality risk in elderly patients with SA-AKI.
METHODS: Machine learning models were developed and validated using the public, 
high-quality Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care (MIMIC)-IV critically 
ill database. The recursive feature elimination (RFE) algorithm was employed for 
key feature selection. Eleven predictive models were compared, with the best one 
selected for further validation. Shapley Additive Explanations (SHAP) values 
were used for visualization and interpretation, making the machine learning 
models clinically interpretable.
RESULTS: There were 16,154 patients with SA-AKI in the MIMIC-IV database, and 
8426 SA-AKI patients were included in this study (median age: 77.0 years; 
female: 45%). 7728 patients excluded based on these criteria. They were randomly 
divided into a training cohort (5,934, 70%) and a validation cohort (2,492, 
30%). Nine key features were selected by the RFE algorithm. The CatBoost model 
achieved the best performance, with an AUC of 0.844 in the training cohort and 
0.804 in the validation cohort. SHAP values revealed that AKI stage, PaO2, and 
lactate were the top three most important features contributing to the CatBoost 
model.
CONCLUSION: We developed a model capable of predicting the risk of in-hospital 
mortality in elderly patients with SA-AKI.

OBJECTIVE: High glycemic variability (GV) often indicates a poor prognosis. Our 
aim is to investigate the relationship between GV and short and long-term 
mortality in critically ill heart failure (HF) patients.
METHODS: We extracted data from the Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care 
IV database. The risks of in-hospital and 1-year mortality were calculated using 
Logistic and COX regression. In addition, mediation analysis was used to 
investigate the indirect effect of ventricular arrhythmias (VA) on in-hospital 
mortality.
RESULTS: Among 8,980 critically ill HF patients, the multifactorial regression 
analysis showed that high GV was associated with an increased risk of 
in-hospital and 1-year mortality (OR 1.69, 95 % CI 1.47-1.93; HR 1.12, 95 % CI 
1.02-1.22). The Kaplan-Meier survival curve and restricted cubic spline plot 
also emphasized this association. Furthermore, the impact of GV on in-hospital 
mortality was partially mediated by VA (4.98%). And the increased risk of 1-year 
mortality associated with high GV was more significant in person with diabetes 
(p for interaction =0.018).
CONCLUSION: Our Study indicates that high GV may be an independent risk factor 
for short and long-term mortality in critically ill HF patients. Maintaining the 
stability of blood glucose can reduce adverse outcomes in critically ill HF 
patients.

RATIONALE: Patients transferred from the intensive care unit to the wards who 
are later readmitted to the intensive care unit have increased length of stay, 
healthcare expenditure, and mortality compared with those who are never 
readmitted. Improving risk stratification for patients transferred to the wards 
could have important benefits for critically ill hospitalized patients.
OBJECTIVES: We aimed to use a machine-learning technique to derive and validate 
an intensive care unit readmission prediction model with variables available in 
the electronic health record in real time and compare it to previously published 
algorithms.
METHODS: This observational cohort study was conducted at an academic hospital 
in the United States with approximately 600 inpatient beds. A total of 24,885 
intensive care unit transfers to the wards were included, with 14,962 transfers 
(60%) in the training cohort and 9,923 transfers (40%) in the internal 
validation cohort. Patient characteristics, nursing assessments, International 
Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision codes from prior admissions, 
medications, intensive care unit interventions, diagnostic tests, vital signs, 
and laboratory results were extracted from the electronic health record and used 
as predictor variables in a gradient-boosted machine model. Accuracy for 
predicting intensive care unit readmission was compared with the Stability and 
Workload Index for Transfer score and Modified Early Warning Score in the 
internal validation cohort and also externally using the Medical Information 
Mart for Intensive Care database (n = 42,303 intensive care unit transfers).
RESULTS: Eleven percent (2,834) of discharges to the wards were later readmitted 
to the intensive care unit. The machine-learning-derived model had significantly 
better performance (area under the receiver operating curve, 0.76) than either 
the Stability and Workload Index for Transfer score (area under the receiver 
operating curve, 0.65), or Modified Early Warning Score (area under the receiver 
operating curve, 0.58; P value < 0.0001 for all comparisons). At a specificity 
of 95%, the derived model had a sensitivity of 28% compared with 15% for 
Stability and Workload Index for Transfer score and 7% for the Modified Early 
Warning Score. Accuracy improvements with the derived model over Modified Early 
Warning Score and Stability and Workload Index for Transfer were similar in the 
Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care-III cohort.
CONCLUSIONS: A machine learning approach to predicting intensive care unit 
readmission was significantly more accurate than previously published algorithms 
in both our internal validation and the Medical Information Mart for Intensive 
Care-III cohort. Implementation of this approach could target patients who may 
benefit from additional time in the intensive care unit or more frequent 
monitoring after transfer to the hospital ward.

INTRODUCTION: Hemorrhagic stroke may cause changes in intracranial pressure 
(ICP) and cerebral perfusion pressure (CPP), which may influence the prognosis 
of patients. The aim of this study was to investigate the relationship between 
early ICP, CPP, and 28-day mortality in the intensive care unit (ICU) of 
patients with hemorrhagic stroke.
PATIENTS AND METHODS: A retrospective study was performed using the Medical 
Information Mart for Intensive Care (MIMIC-IV) and the eICU Collaborative 
Research Database (eICU-CRD), including hemorrhagic stroke patients in the ICU 
with recorded ICP monitoring. The median values of ICP and CPP were collected 
for the first 24 h of the patient's monitoring. The primary outcome was 28-day 
ICU mortality. Multivariable Cox proportional hazards models were used to 
analyze the relationship between ICP, CPP, and 28-day ICU mortality. Restricted 
cubic regression splines were used to analyze nonlinear relationships.
RESULTS: The study included 837 patients with a 28-day ICU mortality rate of 
19.4%. Multivariable analysis revealed a significant correlation between early 
ICP and 28-day ICU mortality (HR 1.08, 95% CI 1.04-1.12, p < 0.01), whereas 
early CPP showed no correlation with 28-day ICU mortality (HR 1.00, 95% CI 
0.98-1.01, p = 0.57), with a correlation only evident when CPP < 60 mmHg (HR 
1.99, 95% CI 1.14-3.48, p = 0.01). The study also identified an early ICP 
threshold of 16.5 mmHg.
DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSION: Early ICP shows a correlation with 28-day mortality 
in hemorrhagic stroke patients, with a potential intervention threshold of 
16.5 mmHg. In contrast, early CPP showed no correlation with patient prognosis.

OBJECTIVE: To investigate the association between preoperative nutritional 
scores and moderate-to-severe acute kidney injury (AKI) after coronary artery 
bypass graft (CABG) surgery and the predictive significance of nutritional 
indices for moderate to severe AKI.
METHODS: This study retrospectively included older patients underwent CABG 
surgery from the Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care (MIMIC) database. 
Nutritional scores were calculated by the Geriatric Nutritional Risk Index 
(GNRI) and the Prognostic Nutritional Index (PNI), respectively. 
Moderate-to-severe injury was determined by KDIGO criteria. Logistic regression, 
subgroup analysis, and restricted cubic splines were utilized to investigate the 
association. The predictive value was also assessed by the area under the curve 
(AUC), net reclassification index (NRI), and integrated discrimination 
improvement (IDI).
RESULTS: A total of 1,007 patients were retrospectively included, of which 100 
(9.9%) and 380 (37.7%) had malnutrition calculated by GNRI and PNI scores. The 
incidence of moderate-to-severe AKI was 524 (52.0%). After adjustment for 
selected risk factors, worse nutritional scores were associated with a higher 
incidence of moderate-to-severe AKI (PGNRI<0.001; PPNI=0.001). Integrating these 
indices into different base models improves their performance, as manifested by 
significant improvements in AUCs and NRIs (p < 0.05).
CONCLUSION: Worse preoperative nutritional status was associated with an 
elevated risk of postoperative moderate-to-severe AKI. Integrating these indices 
into base models improve their predictive performance. These results highlight 
the importance of assessing nutritional status among older patients had CABG 
surgery.

BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Improved mortality prediction among intensive care unit 
(ICU) inpatients is a valuable and challenging task. Limited clinical data, 
especially with appropriate labels, are an important element restricting 
accurate predictions. Generative adversarial networks (GANs) are excellent 
generative models and have shown great potential for data simulation. However, 
there have been no relevant studies using GANs to predict mortality among ICU 
inpatients. In this study, we aim to evaluate the predictive performance of a 
variant of GAN called conditional medical GAN (c-med GAN) compared with some 
baseline models, including simplified acute physiology score II (SAPS II), 
support vector machine (SVM), and multilayer perceptron (MLP).
METHODS: Data from a publicly available intensive care database, the Medical 
Information Mart for Intensive Care III (MIMIC-III) database (v1.4), were 
included in this study. The area under the precision-recall curve (PR-AUC), area 
under the receiver operating characteristic curve (ROC-AUC), and F1 score were 
used to evaluate the predictive performance. In addition, the size of the 
dataset was artificially reduced, and the performance of the c-med GAN was 
compared in different size datasets.
RESULTS: The results showed that c-med GAN achieves the best PR-AUC, ROC-AUC, 
and F1 score compared with SAPS II, SVM, and MLP when training in the full 
MIMIC-III dataset. When the size of the dataset was reduced, the prediction 
performances of both MLP and c-med GAN were affected. However, the c-med GAN 
still outperformed MLP on smaller datasets and had less degradation.
CONCLUSION: The prediction of in-hospital mortality based on the c-med GAN for 
ICU patients showed better performance than the baseline models. Despite some 
inadequacies, this model may have a promising future in clinical applications 
which will be explored by further research.

Background The stress hyperglycemia ratio (SHR) indicates relative hyperglycemia 
levels. Research on the impact of SHR on mortality in coronary heart disease 
(CHD) patients in intensive care is limited. This study explores the predictive 
accuracy of SHR for the prognosis of CHD patients in the ICU. Methods This study 
included 2,059 CHD patients from the American Medical Information Mart for 
Intensive Care (MIMIC-IV) database. SHR was determined using the formula: SHR = 
(admission glucose) (mmol/L) / (1.59 * HbA1c [%] - 2.59). Subjects were 
stratified into quartiles based on SHR levels to examine the correlation between 
SHR and in-hospital mortality. The restricted cubic splines and Cox proportional 
hazards models were employed to assess this association, while Kaplan-Meier 
survival analysis was executed to ascertain the mortality rates across the SHR 
quartiles. Results Among the 2059 participants (1358 men), the rates of 
in-hospital and ICU mortality were 8.5% and 5.25%, respectively. Analysis showed 
SHR as a significant predictor of increased risk for both in-hospital (HR,1.16, 
95% CI: 1.02-1.32, P = 0.022) and ICU mortality (HR, 1.16, 95% CI: 1.01-1.35, 
P = 0.040) after adjustments. A J-shaped relationship was noted between SHR and 
mortality risks (p for non-linearity = 0.002, respectively). Kaplan-Meier 
analysis confirmed substantial differences in in-hospital and ICU mortality 
across SHR quartiles. Conclusions SHR significantly predicts in-hospital and ICU 
mortality in critically ill CHD patients, indicating that higher SHR levels 
correlate with longer ICU stays and increased mortality. This underscores the 
potential of SHR as a prognostic marker for ICU CHD patients.

The recent release of large-scale healthcare datasets has greatly propelled the 
research of data-driven deep learning models for healthcare applications. 
However, due to the nature of such deep black-boxed models, concerns about 
interpretability, fairness, and biases in healthcare scenarios where human lives 
are at stake call for a careful and thorough examination of both datasets and 
models. In this work, we focus on MIMIC-IV (Medical Information Mart for 
Intensive Care, version IV), the largest publicly available healthcare dataset, 
and conduct comprehensive analyses of interpretability as well as dataset 
representation bias and prediction fairness of deep learning models for 
in-hospital mortality prediction. First, we analyze the interpretability of deep 
learning mortality prediction models and observe that (1) the best-performing 
interpretability method successfully identifies critical features for mortality 
prediction on various prediction models as well as recognizing new important 
features that domain knowledge does not consider; (2) prediction models rely on 
demographic features, raising concerns in fairness. Therefore, we then evaluate 
the fairness of models and do observe the unfairness: (1) there exists disparate 
treatment in prescribing mechanical ventilation among patient groups across 
ethnicity, gender and age; (2) models often rely on racial attributes unequally 
across subgroups to generate their predictions. We further draw concrete 
connections between interpretability methods and fairness metrics by showing how 
feature importance from interpretability methods can be beneficial in 
quantifying potential disparities in mortality predictors. Our analysis 
demonstrates that the prediction performance is not the only factor to consider 
when evaluating models for healthcare applications, since high prediction 
performance might be the result of unfair utilization of demographic features. 
Our findings suggest that future research in AI models for healthcare 
applications can benefit from utilizing the analysis workflow of 
interpretability and fairness as well as verifying if models achieve superior 
performance at the cost of introducing bias.

OBJECTIVE: To investigate the association between renal mean perfusion pressure 
(MPP) and prognosis in sepsis-associated acute kidney injury (SA-AKI).
METHODS: Data were extracted from the Medical Information Mart for Intensive 
Care IV (MIMIC-IV) database. Group-based trajectory modeling (GBTM) was applied 
to identify dynamic MPP patterns, while restricted cubic spline (RCS) curves 
were utilized to confirm the non-linear relationship between MPP and mortality. 
Cox regression analysis assessed the risk of mortality across different MPP 
levels, adjusting for potential confounders. Subgroup analyses and sensitivity 
analyses were conducted to ensure the robustness of the findings.
RESULTS: A total of 2318 patients with SA-AKI were stratified into five MPP 
trajectories by GBTM. Patients in Traj-1 and Traj-2, characterized by 
consistently low MPP (<60 mmHg), demonstrated markedly higher 90-d mortality 
(62.86% and 26.98%). RCS curves revealed a non-linear inverse relationship 
between MPP and 90-d mortality, identifying 60 mmHg as the optimal threshold. 
Patients with MPP ≤ 60 mmHg exhibited significantly elevated 90-d mortality 
compared to those with MPP > 60 mmHg (29.81% vs. 20.88%). Cox regression 
analysis established Traj-1 and Traj-2 as independent risk factors for increased 
mortality relative to Traj-3 (60-70 mmHg), with hazard ratios (HRs) of 4.67 
(95%-CI 3.28-6.67) and 1.45 (95%-CI 1.20-1.76). MPP > 60 mmHg was significantly 
associated with reduced 90-d mortality (HR 0.65, 95%-CI 0.55-0.77). Subgroup and 
PSM analyses supported these findings.
CONCLUSIONS: Dynamic MPP trajectory serves as a valuable prognostic biomarker 
for SA-AKI. Early monitoring of MPP trends offers critical insights into renal 
perfusion management, potentially improving outcomes in SA-AKI.

OBJECTIVE: To explore an artificial intelligence approach based on 
gradient-boosted decision trees for prediction of all-cause mortality at an 
intensive care unit, comparing its performance to a recent logistic regression 
system in the literature, and a logistic regression model built on the same 
platform.
METHODS: A gradient-boosted decision trees model and a logistic regression model 
were trained and tested with the Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care 
database. The 1-hour resolution physiological measurements of adult patients, 
collected during 5 hours in the intensive care unit, consisted of eight routine 
clinical parameters. The study addressed how the models learn to categorize 
patients to predict intensive care unit mortality or survival within 12 hours. 
The performance was evaluated with accuracy statistics and the area under the 
Receiver Operating Characteristic curve.
RESULTS: The gradient-boosted trees yielded an area under the Receiver Operating 
Characteristic curve of 0.89, compared to 0.806 for the logistic regression. The 
accuracy was 0.814 for the gradient-boosted trees, compared to 0.782 for the 
logistic regression. The diagnostic odds ratio was 17.823 for the 
gradient-boosted trees, compared to 9.254 for the logistic regression. The 
Cohen's kappa, F-measure, Matthews correlation coefficient, and markedness were 
higher for the gradient-boosted trees.
CONCLUSION: The discriminatory power of the gradient-boosted trees was 
excellent. The gradient-boosted trees outperformed the logistic regression 
regarding intensive care unit mortality prediction. The high diagnostic odds 
ratio and markedness values for the gradient-boosted trees are important in the 
context of the studied unbalanced dataset.

OBJETIVO: Explorar uma abordagem de inteligência artificial baseada em árvores 
de decisão impulsionadas por gradiente para previsão de mortalidade por todas as 
causas em unidade de terapia intensiva, comparando seu desempenho com um sistema 
de regressão logística recente na literatura e um modelo de regressão logística 
construído na mesma plataforma.
MÉTODOS: Foram desenvolvidos um modelo de árvores impulsionadas por gradiente e 
um modelo de regressão logística, treinados e testados com o banco de dados 
Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care. As medidas fisiológicas de 
pacientes adultos com resolução de 1 hora, coletadas durante 5 horas na unidade 
de terapia intensiva, consistiram em oito parâmetros clínicos de rotina. 
Estudou-se como os modelos aprendem a categorizar os pacientes para prever a 
mortalidade ou a sobrevida, em unidades de terapia intensiva, em 12 horas. O 
desempenho foi avaliado por meio de estatísticas de acurácia e pela área sob a 
curva Característica de Operação do Receptor.
RESULTADOS: As árvores impulsionadas por gradiente produziram área sob a curva 
Característica de Operação do Receptor de 0,89, em comparação com 0,806 para a 
regressão logística. A acurácia foi de 0,814 para as árvores impulsionadas por 
gradiente, em comparação com 0,782 para a regressão logística. A razão de 
chances de diagnóstico foi de 17,823 para as árvores impulsionadas por 
gradiente, em comparação a 9,254 para a regressão logística. O kappa de Cohen, a 
medida F, o coeficiente de correlação de Matthews e a marcação foram maiores 
para as árvores impulsionadas por gradiente.
CONCLUSÃO: O poder discriminatório das árvores impulsionadas por gradiente foi 
excelente. As árvores impulsionadas por gradiente superaram a regressão 
logística em relação à previsão de mortalidade em unidade de terapia intensiva. 
A alta razão de chances de diagnóstico e os valores de marcação para as árvores 
impulsionadas por gradiente são importantes no contexto do conjunto de dados não 
balanceados estudado.

INTRODUCTION: Glycaemic variability (GV), rather than glucose level, has been 
shown to be an important factor associated with in-hospital mortality. The 
coefficient of variation of glucose (GLUCV) is one of the methods used to 
evaluate GV. However, the clinical significance of GLUCV in diabetes mellitus 
(DM) patients diagnosed with chronic kidney disease (CKD) as a risk factor for 
long-term adverse changes is unknown.
MATERIAL AND METHODS: In this retrospective study, we extracted data of adult DM 
patients diagnosed with CKD from the Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care 
(MIMIC-IV). We sought to investigate the relationship between GV and in-hospital 
mortality as well as 30-day mortality. A non-parametric test was used to compare 
baseline characteristics between groups. Kaplan-Meier analysis and Cox 
regression model were used to analyse the risk factors associated with 
in-hospital and 30-day mortality.
RESULTS: A total of 1572 DM patients with CKD were included in our data 
analysis. The quartile of the GLUCV values was used to assign subjects to 4 
groups: GLUCV1 (GLUCV < 24), GLUCV2 (24 ≤ GLUCV < 31), GLUCV3 (31 ≤ GLUCV < 39) 
and GLUCV 4 (GLUCV ≥ 39). COX regression analysis revealed that the GLUCV was an 
independent risk factor for in-hospital and 30-day mortality [GLUCV2 group (HR = 
0.639, 95% CI: 0.454-0.899, p = 0.010), GLUCV3 group (HR = 0.668, 95% CI: 
0.476-0.936, p = 0.019), and GLUCV3 group (HR = 0.726, 95% CI: 0.528-0.999, p = 
0.049)]. The Kaplan-Meier survival curve was steeper in the GLUCV1 and GLUCV4 
groups, and the survival rate decreased in a time-dependent manner.
CONCLUSIONS: Herein, we validated GV as a mortality risk factor for DM patients 
with CKD. Therefore, monitoring and adjusting GV in hospitalized patients might 
have a significant treatment benefit.

OBJECT: Establish a clinical prognosis model of coronary heart disease (CHD) to 
predict 28-day mortality in patients with sepsis.
METHOD: The data were collected retrospectively from septic patients with a 
previous history of coronary heart disease (CHD) from the Medical Information 
Mart for Intensive Care (MIMIC)-III database. The included patients were 
randomly divided into the training cohorts and validation cohorts. The variables 
were selected using the backward stepwise selection method of Cox regression, 
and a nomogram was subsequently constructed. The nomogram was compared to the 
Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (SOFA) model using the C-index, area under 
the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) over time, Net 
reclassification index (NRI), Integrated discrimination improvement index (IDI), 
calibration map, and decision curve analysis (DCA).
RESULT: A total of 800 patients were included in the study. We developed a 
nomogram based on age, diastolic blood pressure (DBP), pH, lactate, red blood 
cell distribution width (RDW), anion gap, valvular heart disease, peripheral 
vascular disease, and acute kidney injury (AKI) stage. The nomogram was 
evaluated using C-index, AUC, NRI, IDI, calibration plot, and DCA. Our findings 
revealed that this nomogram outperformed the SOFA score in predicting 28-day 
mortality in sepsis patients.

The predictive Intensive Care Unit (ICU) scoring system plays an important role 
in ICU management for its capability of predicting important outcomes, 
especially mortality. There are many scoring systems that have been developed 
and used in the ICU. These scoring systems are primarily based on the structured 
clinical data contained in the electronic health record (EHR), which may suffer 
the loss of the important clinical information contained in the narratives and 
images. In this work, we build a deep learning based survival prediction model 
with multi-modality data to predict ICU-mortality. Four sets of features are 
investigated: (1) physiological measurements of Simplified Acute Physiology 
Score (SAPS) II, (2) common thorax diseases pre-defined by radiologists, (3) 
BERT-based text representations, and (4) chest X-ray image features. We use the 
Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care IV (MIMIC-IV) dataset to evaluate 
the proposed model. Our model achieves the average C-index of 0.7847 (95% 
confidence interval, 0.7625-0.8068), which substantially exceeds that of the 
baseline with SAPS-II features (0.7477 (0.7238-0.7716)). Ablation studies 
further demonstrate the contributions of pre-defined labels (2.12%), text 
features (2.68%), and image features (2.96%). Our model achieves a higher 
average C-index than the traditional machine learning methods under the same 
feature fusion setting, which suggests that the deep learning methods can 
outperform the traditional machine learning methods in ICU-mortality prediction. 
These results highlight the potential of deep learning models with multimodal 
information to enhance ICU-mortality prediction. We make our work publicly 
available at https://github.com/bionlplab/mimic-icu-mortality.

INTRODUCTION: The prognosis of new-onset atrial fibrillation (AF) compared with 
that of preexisting and non-AF remains controversial. The purpose of this study 
was to evaluate the effect of new-onset AF compared with preexisting and non-AF 
on hospital and 90-day mortality.
METHODS: A retrospective cohort study was performed using data obtained from the 
Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care III database. The primary outcome 
was 90-day mortality. Secondary outcomes included hospital mortality, hospital 
and intensive care unit (ICU) length of stay, and acute kidney injury. Logistic 
and Cox regression analyses were performed to evaluate the relationship between 
new-onset AF and study outcomes.
RESULTS: A total of 38,159 adult patients were included in the study. The 
incidence of new-onset AF was 9.4%. Ninety-day mortality, hospital mortality, 
and hospital and ICU length of stay in patients with new-onset and preexisting 
AF were significantly increased compared with those in patients with non-AF 
patients (all p < 0.001). After adjusting for patient characteristics, new-onset 
AF remained associated with increased 90-day mortality compared with non-AF 
(adjusted hazard ratio (HR) 1.37, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.26 to 1.50; 
p < 0.01) and preexisting AF (adjusted HR 1.12; 95%-CI 1.02 to 1.23; p < 0.01). 
Patients in the surgical intensive care unit (SICU) had significantly higher 
90-day mortality than patients in the coronary care unit (adjusted HR 1.30; 95% 
CI 1.31 to 1.51; p < 0.001).
CONCLUSIONS: Critically ill patients with new-onset AF have significantly 
increased hospital and 90-day mortality compared with patients with preexisting 
and non-AF. Patients with new-onset AF in the ICU, especially those in the SICU, 
require robust management measures.

BACKGROUND: To construct and validate a risk assessment model for acute kidney 
injury (AKI) in patients with acute pancreatitis (AP) in the intensive care unit 
(ICU).
METHODS: A total of 963 patients diagnosed with acute pancreatitis (AP) from the 
Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care IV (MIMIC-IV) database was included. 
These patients were randomly divided into training set (N = 674) and validation 
set (N = 289) at a ratio of 7:3. Clinical characteristics were utilized to 
establish a nomogram for the prediction of AKI during ICU stay. These variables 
were selected by the least absolute shrinkage and selection operation (LASSO) 
regression and included in multivariate logistic regression analysis. Variables 
with P-values less than 0.05 were included in the final model. A nomogram was 
constructed based on the final model. The predicted accuracy of the nomogram was 
assessed by calculating the receiver operating characteristic curve (ROC) and 
the area under the curve (AUC). Moreover, calibration curves and Hosmer-Lemeshow 
goodness-of-fit test (HL test) were performed to evaluate model performance. 
Decision curve analysis (DCA) evaluated the clinical net benefit of the model.
RESULTS: A multivariable model that included 6 variables: weight, SOFA score, 
white blood cell count, albumin, chronic heart failure, and sepsis. The C-index 
of the nomogram was 0.82, and the area under the receiver operating 
characteristic curve (AUC) of the training set and validation set were 0.82 (95% 
confidence interval:0.79-0.86) and 0.76 (95% confidence interval: 0.70-0.82), 
respectively. Calibration plots showed good consistency between predicted and 
observed outcomes in both the training and validation sets. DCA confirmed the 
clinical value of the model and its good impact on actual decision-making.
CONCLUSION: We identified risk factors associated with the development of AKI in 
patients with AP. A risk prediction model for AKI in ICU patients with AP was 
constructed, and improving the treatment strategy of relevant factors in the 
model can reduce the risk of AKI in AP patients.

OBJECTIVE: To compare the accuracy of serum lactate parameters, including 
lactate peak concentration (LACpeak), lactate time area (LACarea), and lactate 
clearance (LC) for predicting mortality of the septic patients, and to compare 
with the predictive accuracy of National Early Warning Score (NEWS) and 
Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (SOFA) scores.
METHODS: This study retrospectively screened the septic patients admitted to the 
ICU in the Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care IV (MIMIC-IV) from 2008 
to 2019. The baseline data and outcomes of patients were gathered. The subjects 
were divided into the non-survival group and the survival group. SOFA, NEWS, 
LACpeak, and LACarea were recorded. The LC was calculated 6 h after LACpeak. The 
above parameters were compared by the T-test and Mann-Whitney U test, and odds 
ratios were calculated adjusting for age and sex. The receiver operating 
characteristic curves (ROCs) of subjects were plotted according to SOFA, NEWS, 
LACpeak, and LACarea within 24h, and LC at 6h of ICU admission. The Areas under 
the ROC curve (AUCs), sensitivity, and specificity were compared with R version 
4.1.1.
RESULTS: 1,169 septic patients were involved, and 366 (31.3%) patients died 
within 28 days. Compared to the survival group, the LACpeak of the non-survival 
group was higher [4.85 (3.2, 7.9) vs. 3.4 (2.6, 5.25) mmol/L, adjusted odds 
ratio 1.18, P < 0.001], and the LACarea of the non-survivals was higher than the 
survivals too [18.44 (10.36, 27.63) vs. 13.65 (9.01, 21.73), adjusted odds ratio 
1.03, P < 0.001)]. The LC of the survivals at 6 h after LACpeak was 
significantly higher than that of the non-survivals [0.26 (0.14.0.42) vs. 0.19 
(0.10, 0.33), adjusted odds ratio 0.06, P < 0.01]. Within 24h of ICU admission, 
the AUCs of mortality prediction in descending order were NEWS [0.73 (0.70, 
0.76)], SOFA [0.69 (0.66, 0.73)], LACpeak [0.64 (0.61, 0.68)], and LACarea [0.60 
(0.56, 0.63)]. There were 204 patients with 6-hour LC after LACpeak the AUCs of 
LACarea, LACpeak and LC were 0.73(0.65, 0.80), 0.71(0.62,0.78) and 0.65 (0.56, 
0.73), respectively.
CONCLUSIONS: The predictive accuracy of LC was not superior to LACpeak and 
LACarea for the mortality of the septic patients and the predictive value of all 
the above lactate parameters for mortality maybe not better than SOFA and NEWS.

BACKGROUND: This study aimed to evaluate the association between the 
glucose-to-lymphocyte ratio (GLR) and all-cause mortality in intensive care unit 
(ICU) patients with Non-traumatic cerebral hemorrhage.
METHODS: This is a retrospective cohort study. Baseline data and in-hospital 
prognosis from patients with non-traumatic cerebral hemorrhage admitted to the 
intensive care unit. Multivariate COX regression analysis was applied and 
adjusted hazard ratios (HR) and 95% predictive values with confidence intervals 
(CI) were calculated. Survival curves for the two groups of cases were plotted 
using K-M curves, and subgroup analyses were performed in one step. Using 
restricted cubic spline curves, we analyzed the potential linear relationship 
between GLR and outcome indicators.
RESULTS: In the Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care IV (MIMIC-IV 
database), we extracted 3,783 patients with nontraumatic intracerebral 
hemorrhage, and 1,806 patients were finally enrolled in the study after 
exclusion of missing values and patients with a short hospital stay. The overall 
ICU mortality rate was 8.2% (148/1806) and the in-hospital mortality rate was 
12.5% (225/1806). The use of curve fitting yielded a significant linear 
relationship between GLR and both ICU mortality and in-hospital mortality. It 
also suggested a reference point at GLR=3.9. These patients were categorized 
into high and low subgroups based on the median value of their GLR (GLR = 3.9). 
Model comparisons based on multivariate COX regression analysis showed that 
in-hospital mortality was higher in the high GLR group after adjusting for all 
confounders (HR = 1.31, 95% CI: 1.04-1.47), while the ICU mortality in the high 
GLR group was (HR = 1.73, 95% CI: 1.18-2.52). Stratified analyses based on age, 
gender, race, GCS, BMI, and disease type showed stable correlations between the 
high GLR group and in-hospital and ICU mortality.
CONCLUSION: Based on our retrospective analysis, it is known that as the GLR 
increased, the in-hospital mortality rate and ICU mortality rate of patients 
with nontraumatic cerebral hemorrhage also increased progressively in the United 
States in a clear linear relationship. However, further studies are needed to 
confirm these findings.

The prognosis of septic patients with cirrhosis is worse compared to septic 
patients without cirrhosis. Early and accurate prognosis determination in 
patients with cirrhosis and sepsis is pivotal for guiding treatment decisions. 
The aim of this study was to investigate the association between 
albumin-corrected anion gap (ACAG) and clinical prognosis of patients with 
sepsis and cirrhosis. This study extracted data of patients with sepsis and 
cirrhosis from the Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care (MIMIC-IV) 
database. A total of 1340 patients (64.6% male) were enrolled. After confounders 
adjusting, elevated ACAG had a significant association with 28-day mortality 
(HR1.604; 95% CI 1.258-2.048; P < 0.001). Restricted cubic spline revealed that 
a linear relationship between ACAG and 28-day mortality (P-nonlinear = 0.089, 
P-overall = 0.001). According to the ROC curve analysis, the ACAG demonstrated a 
higher area under the curve (AUC) of 0.703 compared to AG (0.675). Kaplan-Meier 
analysis revealed higher 28-day mortality in high ACAG group (log-rank test, 
χ^2 = 175.638, P < 0.001). Furthermore, subgroup analysis showed a significant 
interaction between ACAG and etiology of cirrhosis (P for interaction = 0.014). 
Therefore, ACAG could provide clinicians with valuable insights for guiding 
interventions in this high-risk population.

BACKGROUND: Patients with heart failure (HF) with diabetes may face a poorer 
prognosis and higher mortality than patients with either disease alone, 
especially for those in intensive care unit. So far, there is no precise 
mortality risk prediction indicator for this kind of patient.
METHOD: Two high-quality critically ill databases, the Medical Information Mart 
for Intensive Care IV (MIMIC-IV) database and the Telehealth Intensive Care Unit 
(eICU) Collaborative Research Database (eICU-CRD) Collaborative Research 
Database, were used for study participants' screening as well as internal and 
external validation. Nine machine learning models were compared, and the best 
one was selected to define indicators associated with hospital mortality for 
patients with HF with diabetes. Existing attributes most related to hospital 
mortality were identified using a visualization method developed for machine 
learning, namely, Shapley Additive Explanations (SHAP) method. A new composite 
indicator ASL was established using logistics regression for patients with HF 
with diabetes based on major existing indicators. Then, the new index was 
compared with existing indicators to confirm its discrimination ability and 
clinical value using the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve, decision 
curve, and calibration curve.
RESULTS: The random forest model outperformed among nine models with the area 
under the ROC curve (AUC) = 0.92 after hyper-parameter optimization. By using 
this model, the top 20 attributes associated with hospital mortality in these 
patients were identified among all the attributes based on SHAP method. Acute 
Physiology Score (APS) III, Sepsis-related Organ Failure Assessment (SOFA), and 
Max lactate were selected as major attributes related to mortality risk, and a 
new composite indicator was developed by combining these three indicators, which 
was named as ASL. Both in the initial and external cohort, the new indicator, 
ASL, had greater risk discrimination ability with AUC higher than 0.80 in both 
low- and high-risk groups compared with existing attributes. The decision curve 
and calibration curve indicated that this indicator also had a respectable 
clinical value compared with APS III and SOFA. In addition, this indicator had a 
good risk stratification ability when the patients were divided into three risk 
levels.
CONCLUSION: A new composite indicator for predicting mortality risk in patients 
with HF with diabetes admitted to intensive care unit was developed on the basis 
of attributes identified by the random forest model. Compared with existing 
attributes such as APS III and SOFA, the new indicator had better discrimination 
ability and clinical value, which had potential value in reducing the mortality 
risk of these patients.

BACKGROUND: Sepsis is a recognized global health challenge that places a 
considerable disease burden on countries. Although there has been some progress 
in the study of sepsis, the mortality rate of sepsis remains high. The 
relationship between serum osmolality and the prognosis of patients with sepsis 
is unclear.
METHOD: Patients with sepsis who met the criteria in the Medical Information 
Mart for Intensive Care IV database were included in the study. Hazard ratios 
(HRs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were determined using multivariable Cox 
regression. The relationship between serum osmolality and the 28-day mortality 
risk in patients with sepsis was investigated using curve fitting, and 
inflection points were calculated.
RESULTS: A total of 13,219 patients with sepsis were enrolled in the study; the 
mean age was 65.1 years, 56.9 % were male, and the 28-day mortality rate was 
18.8 %. After adjusting for covariates, the risk of 28-day mortality was 
elevated by 99% (HR 1.99, 95%CI 1.74-2.28) in the highest quintile of serum 
osmolality (Q5 >303.21) and by 59% (HR 1.59, 95%CI 1.39-1.83) in the lowest 
quintile (Q1 ≤285.80), as compared to the reference quintile (Q3 291.38-296.29). 
The results of the curve fitting showed a U-shaped relationship between serum 
osmolality and the risk of 28-day mortality, with an inflection point of 286.9 
mmol/L.
CONCLUSION: There is a U-shaped relationship between serum osmolality and the 
28-day mortality risk in patients with sepsis. Higher or lower serum osmolality 
is associated with an increased risk of mortality in patients with sepsis. 
Patients with sepsis have a lower risk of mortality when their osmolality is 
285.80-296.29 mmol/L.

BACKGROUND: The early identification of patients at high risk for acute kidney 
injury (AKI) with a poor prognosis is crucial to prevent complications and 
minimize mortality. This study sought to investigate the association between 
albumin-corrected anion gap (ACAG) and all-cause mortality among critically ill 
patients with AKI.
METHODS: All eligible AKI patients from the Medical Information Mart for 
Intensive Care IV (MIMIC-IV version 2.0) database were considered for 
participation in this study. We employed Kaplan-Meier curves to assess the 30-d 
and 360-d cumulative survival rates among various groups. Flexibly visualizing 
the connection between ACAG and mortality, we utilize restricted cubic splines 
(RCS) and multivariate Cox regression models. Result robustness underwent 
assessment through subgroup analyses and sensitivity analyses. 
Receiver-operating characteristic (ROC) curves were generated to evaluate the 
predictive performance of ACAG.
RESULTS: The study included 9625 AKI participants, of whom 58.60% were male, and 
the 360-d all-cause mortality rate was 39.89%. According to Kaplan-Meier 
analysis, the 30-d and 360-d cumulative survival rates for AKI patients were 
significantly lower in the high ACAG group than in the normal ACAG group. RCS 
analysis indicated that ACAG levels had a non-linear correlation with the risk 
of 30-d and 360-d mortality for AKI patients. Cox regression analysis 
demonstrated that ACAG is an independent risk indicator for 30-d and 360-d 
prognosis in AKI patients in the ICU.
CONCLUSIONS: Elevated ACAG levels (> 20 mmol/L) at ICU admission were associated 
with 30-d and 360-d all-cause mortality in critically ill patients with AKI.

The incidence of pneumonia in ICU patients with TBI is very high, seriously 
affecting the prognosis. This study aims to construct a predictive model for 
pneumonia in ICU patients with TBI and provide help for the prevention of 
TBI-related pneumonia.Clinical data of ICU patients with TBI were collected from 
the Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care (MIMIC)-IV database and hospital 
data. Variables were screened by lasso and multivariate logistic regression to 
construct a predictive nomogram model, verified in internal validation cohort 
and external validation cohort by receiver operator characteristic (ROC) curve, 
calibration curve and decision curve analysis (DCA).A total of 1850 ICU patients 
with TBI were enrolled in the study from the MIMIC-IV database, including 1298 
in the training cohort and 552 in internal validation cohort. The external 
validation cohort included 240 ICU patients with TBI from hospital data. Nine 
variables were selected from the training cohort by lasso regression and 
multivariate logistic regression, and a pneumonia prediction nomogram was 
constructed. This nomogram has a high discrimination in training, internal 
validation and external validation cohorts (AUC = 0.857, 0.877, 0.836). The 
calibration curve and DCA showed that this nomogram had a high calibration and 
better clinical decision-making efficiency.The nomogram showed excellent 
discrimination and clinical utility to predict pneumonia, and could identify 
pneumonia high-risk patients early, thus providing personalised treatment 
strategies for ICU patients with TBI.

Heart failure (HF) is associated with poor prognosis. While various immune 
markers have been linked to HF outcomes, the relationship between eosinophils 
(EOS) and prognosis across different HF phenotypes remains unclear and 
controversial. In this study, we analyzed 2,677 HF patients from the Medical 
Information Mart for Intensive Care III (MIMIC-III) database, categorizing them 
into reduced ejection fraction (≤ 50%) and preserved ejection fraction (> 50%) 
groups. Multiple logistic regression, Kaplan-Meier survival curve estimation, 
Cox proportional hazards model, and restricted cubic splines were employed to 
assess the association between admission EOS and mortality. Subgroup analyses 
were conducted based on age, gender, sepsis, atrial fibrillation, hypertension 
and rheumatic and immunological diseases and mechanical ventilation. A total of 
954 patients with heart failure with reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF) and 1723 
patients with heart failure with preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF) were 
enrolled, with a female proportion of 37.84% and 56.88%, respectively. The 
median age of patients was 74.46 (IQR: 63.34-83.26) years and the median EOS was 
0.09 (IQR: 0.04-0.20). Among these patients, in-hospital mortality was 14.5% 
(389 patients), and the overall 90-day mortality rate reached 27.12% (726 
patients). There were no significant differences in EOS levels between the HFrEF 
and HFpEF groups (0.1 vs. 0.09, P = 0.154). After adjusting for confounders, 
multivariate logistic regression showed that higher EOS quartiles were 
associated with reduced in-hospital mortality in HFrEF patients, with quartile 3 
(Q3) (OR 0.54, 95% CI 0.31-0.96, P = 0.035) and Q4 (OR 0.37, 95% CI 0.19-0.71, 
P = 0.003) showing significant protective effects compared with the lowest EOS 
quartile (Q1), while Q2 did not reach statistical significance (P = 0.931). 
Subgroup analyses yielded similar findings. Multivariate Cox regression 
demonstrated a reduced hazard ratio in Q4 (HR 0.64, 95% CI 0.44-0.94, P = 0.023) 
compared with Q1 in HFrEF patients. However, no significant association was 
observed between EOS and prognosis in HFpEF. Our findings indicated that higher 
EOS was associated with improved in-hospital and 90-day survival in ICU patients 
with HFrEF, but not in those with HFpEF.

BACKGROUND: Current prediction models are suboptimal for determining mortality 
risk in patients with acute pancreatitis (AP); this might be improved by using a 
machine learning (ML) model. In this study, we aimed to construct an explainable 
ML model to calculate the risk of mortality in patients with AP admitted in 
intensive care unit (ICU) and compared it with existing scoring systems.
METHODS: A gradient-boosting ML (XGBoost) model was developed and externally 
validated based on two public databases: Medical Information Mart for Intensive 
Care (MIMIC, training cohort) and the eICU Collaborative Research Database 
(eICU-CRD, validation cohort). We compared the performance of the XGBoost model 
with validated clinical risk scoring systems (the APACHE IV, SOFA, and Bedside 
Index for Severity in Acute Pancreatitis [BISAP]) by area under receiver 
operating characteristic curve (AUC) analysis. SHAP (SHapley Additive 
exPlanations) method was applied to provide the explanation behind the 
prediction outcome.
RESULTS: The XGBoost model performed better than the clinical scoring systems in 
correctly predicting mortality risk of AP patients, achieving an AUC of 0.89 
(95% CI: 0.84-0.94). When set the sensitivity at 100% for death prediction, the 
model had a specificity of 38%, much higher than the APACHE IV, SOFA and BISAP 
score, which had a specificity of 1%, 16% and 1% respectively.
CONCLUSIONS: This model might increase identification of very low-risk patients 
who can be safely monitored in a general ward for management. By making the 
model explainable, physicians would be able to better understand the reasoning 
behind the prediction.

BACKGROUND: Managing systolic blood pressure (SBP), diastolic blood pressure 
(DBP), and heart rate (HR) is pivotal in acute aortic dissection (AAD) care. 
However, no prior studies have jointly analyzed the trajectories of these 
parameters. This research aimed to characterize their joint longitudinal 
trajectories and investigate the influence on AAD prognosis.
METHODS: We included AAD patients from the Medical Information Mart for 
Intensive Care (MIMIC)-IV database. Using group-based multi-trajectory modeling 
(GBMTM), we identified combined trajectories of SBP, DBP, and HR within the 
initial 24 h of intensive care unit (ICU) admission. Cox proportional hazard 
regression, log-binomial regression, and logistic regression were employed to 
assess the association between trajectory groups and mortality outcomes.
RESULTS: Data from 337 patients were analyzed. GBMTM identified five combined 
trajectory groups. Group 1 featured rapidly declining SBP and DBP with high 
pulse pressure and low HR; Group 2 showed high to moderate SBP with slight 
rebound and persistently low HR; Group 3 displayed persistently moderate BP and 
HR; Group 4 was characterized by moderate blood pressure with persistently high 
HR; and Group 5 had high to moderate SBP with slight rebound, high but gradually 
declining DBP, and slightly high HR. Group 3 demonstrated a lower risk of 
mortality, with an adjusted hazard ratio of 0.32 (95 % CI, 0.14-0.74), and the 
adjusted relative risks for in-hospital, 30-day, and 1-year mortalities were 
0.37 (95 % CI, 0.15-0.87), 0.25 (95 % CI, 0.10-0.62), and 0.41 (95 % CI, 
0.22-0.79), respectively. The time-independent C-index curve demonstrated that 
the multi-trajectory groups had higher C-index values than any univariate 
trajectory groups or admission values of SBP, DBP, and HR.
CONCLUSIONS: Utilization of GBMTM can yield data-driven insights to identify 
distinct subphenotypes in AAD patients. The combined trajectories of SBP, DBP, 
and HR within 24 h of ICU admission significantly influenced the mortality rate.

BACKGROUND: Sepsis-associated liver injury (SALI) is a common complication in 
sepsis patients, significantly affecting their prognosis. Previous studies have 
shown that aspirin can improve the prognosis of septic patients. However, there 
is currently a lack of clinical evidence supporting the use of aspirin in the 
treatment of SALI. Therefore, we conducted this study to explore the association 
between the use of aspirin and the prognosis of patients with SALI.
METHODS: The patients in this study were obtained from the Medical Information 
Mart for Intensive Care IV (MIMIC-IV) database, version 3.0. The primary outcome 
was 30-day all-cause mortality. Baseline characteristics between the aspirin and 
non-aspirin groups were balanced using propensity score matching (PSM). The 
Kaplan-Meier survival curve and Cox regression analysis were used to investigate 
the association between aspirin use and the prognosis of patients with SALI.
RESULTS: Of 657 SALI patients in this study, 447 (68%) patients had not used 
aspirin during hospitalization, whereas 210 (32%) had. After PSM, the 30-day 
mortality was 33.1% in the non-aspirin group and 21% in the aspirin group, 
indicating a significantly reduced mortality risk in the aspirin group (HR, 
0.57; 95% CI, 0.37-0.90; P = 0.016). Similarly, the results of the multivariable 
Cox regression analysis and inverse probability weighting (IPW) analysis showed 
that, compared to the non-aspirin group, the aspirin group had a significantly 
lower 30-day mortality risk (Multivariable Cox regression analysis: HR, 0.69; 
95% CI, 0.48-0.99; P = 0.047; IPW: HR, 0.62; 95% CI, 0.43-0.89; P = 0.010).
CONCLUSION: Aspirin can reduce 30-day mortality in SALI patients, regardless of 
the dose or timing of administration. However, careful assessment based on 
individual differences is essential to ensure the safety and effectiveness of 
aspirin use.

BACKGROUND: The blood urea nitrogen-to-creatinine ratio (BUNCR) has been 
proposed as a potential biomarker for critical illness-induced catabolism. 
However, its specific relevance and significance in the context of non-traumatic 
intracranial hemorrhage (NTIH) remains unclear. As such, the primary objective 
of this study was to determine the role of BUNCR in the prognosis of patients 
with NTIH.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: All data were sourced from the Medical Information Mart 
for Intensive Care-IV 2.0 (MIMIC-IV) database. Study outcomes included 30-day 
and 1-year mortality rates. Univariate and multivariate logistic regression 
analyses were used to calculate adjusted odds ratio with corresponding 95% 
confidence interval, and generalized additive model were used to identify both 
linear and non-linear relationships between BUNCR and mortality rates. A 
two-piecewise regression model was performed to calculate the saturation effect. 
Subgroup analyses were performed to evaluate outcome stability in various 
groups.
RESULTS: A retrospective study of 3,069 patients with NTIH revealed a U-shaped 
relationship between BUNCR levels and 30-day/1-year mortality. The two-piecewise 
regression model showed that the inflection points for 30-day and 1-year 
mortality were 10.455 and 16.25, respectively. On the left side of the 
inflection point, the 30-day and 1-year mortality rate decreased by 17.7% 
(OR = 0.823, 95%CI: 0.705-0.960; p = 0.013) and 5.3% (OR = 0.947, 95%CI: 
0.899-0.999; p = 0.046), respectively, per 1 unit increment of BUNCR. On the 
right side of the inflection point, the 30-day and 1-year mortality rate 
increased by 1.6% (OR = 1.016, 95%CI: 1.000-1.031; p = 0.046) and 3.6% 
(OR = 1.036, 95%CI:1.019-1.054; p < 0.001) per 1 unit decrement of BUNCR. 
Subgroup analyses revealed consistent results across different strata.
CONCLUSION: This study identified a nonlinear relationship between BUNCR and 
mortality in patients with NTIH, indicating that BUNCR may be valuable 
prognostic marker for early identification and proactive management.

BACKGROUND: Triglyceride glucose (TyG) is associated with stroke, 
atherosclerosis, and adverse clinical outcomes. However, its correlation with 
cerebrovascular disease (CVD) mortality remains unclear. This study aimed to 
investigate the relationship between TyG index and mortality in patients with 
CVD.
METHODS: Patient data sourced from the Medical Information Mart for Intensive 
Care -IV database were categorized based on TyG quartiles. Kaplan-Meier survival 
analysis was used to estimate survival disparities among the TyG subgroups. Cox 
proportional risk modeling was used to examine the association between the TyG 
index and mortality. Generalized summation models were applied to fit the 
smoothed curves. log-likelihood ratio test were used to analyze the non-linear 
relationship.
RESULTS: The study comprised 1,965 patients (50.18% were male). The 28-day and 
90-day mortality rates were 20.10% and 24.48%, respectively. The TyG index 
exhibited a linear relationship with the 28-day mortality (Hazards ratio (HR), 
1.16; 95% confidence interval (CI), 0.99-1.36) and the 90-day mortality (HR, 
1.18; 95% CI, 1.02-1.37). In the TyG Q4 group, each 1 mg/dl increase was linked 
to a 35% rise in the risk of 28-day mortality and a 38% increase in the risk of 
90-day mortality. Subgroup analyses highlighted a more substantial association 
between TyG index and 90-day mortality in the diabetic group.
CONCLUSION: Our findings underscore the positive association between TyG and the 
28- and 90-day mortality rates in patients with CVD. This insight may prove 
pivotal for identifying at-risk populations and enhancing risk prediction in the 
clinical management of CVD.

Sepsis is a clinical syndrome characterised by a severe disorder of 
pathophysiology caused by infection of pathogenic micro-organisms. The addition 
of antioxidant micronutrient therapies such as thiamine to sepsis treatment 
remains controversial. This study explored the effect of thiamine on the 
prognosis of patients with sepsis. This study was a retrospective study 
involving patients with sepsis from the Medical Information Mart for Intensive 
Care IV. Patients were divided into two groups, the thiamine received group (TR) 
and the thiamine unreceived group (TUR), according to whether they were 
supplemented with thiamin via intravenous while in the intensive care unit 
(ICU). The primary outcome was ICU mortality. The association between thiamine 
and outcome was analysed using the Cox proportional hazards regression model, 
propensity score matching (PSM), generalised boosted model-based inverse 
probability of treatment weighting (IPTW) and doubly robust estimation. A total 
of 11 553 sepsis patients were enrolled in this study. After controlling for 
potential confounders using Cox regression models, the TR group had a 
statistically significantly lower ICU mortality risk than the TUR group. The 
hazard ratio of ICU mortality for the TR group was 0·80 (95 % CI 0·70, 0·93). We 
obtained the same results after using PSM, IPTW and doubly robust estimation. 
Supplementation with thiamine has a beneficial effect on the prognosis of 
patients with sepsis. More randomised controlled trials are needed to confirm 
the effectiveness of thiamine supplementation in the treatment of sepsis.

BACKGROUND: Sepsis-associated acute kidney injury (SA-AKI) is common in 
critically ill patients, which is associated with significantly increased 
mortality. Existing mortality prediction tools showed insufficient predictive 
power or failed to reflect patients' dynamic clinical evolution. Therefore, the 
study aimed to develop and validate machine learning-based models for real-time 
mortality prediction in critically ill patients with SA-AKI.
METHODS: The multi-center retrospective study included patients from two 
distinct databases. A total of 12,132 SA-AKI patients from the Medical 
Information Mart for Intensive Care IV (MIMIC-IV) were randomly allocated to the 
training, validation, and internal test sets. An additional 3,741 patients from 
the eICU Collaborative Research Database (eICU-CRD) served as an external test 
set. For every 12 h during the ICU stays, the state-of-the-art eXtreme Gradient 
Boosting (XGBoost) algorithm was used to predict the risk of in-hospital death 
in the following 48, 72, and 120 h and in the first 28 days after ICU admission. 
Area under the receiver operating characteristic curves (AUCs) were calculated 
to evaluate the models' performance.
RESULTS: The XGBoost models, based on routine clinical variables updated every 
12 h, showed better performance in mortality prediction than the SOFA score and 
SAPS-II. The AUCs of the XGBoost models for mortality over different time 
periods ranged from 0.848 to 0.804 in the internal test set and from 0.818 to 
0.748 in the external test set. The shapley additive explanation method provided 
interpretability for the XGBoost models, which improved the understanding of the 
association between the predictor variables and future mortality.
CONCLUSIONS: The interpretable machine learning XGBoost models showed promising 
performance in real-time mortality prediction in critically ill patients with 
SA-AKI, which are useful tools for early identification of high-risk patients 
and timely clinical interventions.

BACKGROUND: The use of SIRS and SOFA criteria in diagnosing sepsis among 
patients has been characterized by increasingly growing criticism. Indeed, the 
definition of sepsis has attracted significant controversy in history across 
medical and academic realms.
METHODS: The study used the Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care-III 
(MIMIC-III) database in assessing the effectiveness of the SIRS and SOFA 
diagnostic criteria. It ascertained the severity and specificity of sepsis 
infection in ICU patients. The Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care-III 
(MIMIC-III) database was established by the Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center 
(BIDMC) and MIT's Computational Physiology Laboratory. The database is a 
voluminous single-center database containing information pertaining to 38,000 
adults who were admitted to the BIDMC in the 11 years leading up to 2012. The 
identification of patients with sepsis was conducted using the International 
Classification of Diseases (ICD-10-CM) diagnosis codes.
RESULTS: The analysis of data for this study was based on the chi-square test, 
which is significant in comparing the specificity, mortality, and sensitivity of 
the data. The process of screening the MIMIC-III database resulted in the 
identification of 21,368 patients with infections from the hospital admissions 
in the database. The results also indicate a significantly higher mortality rate 
within 28 days of admission in sepsis-3 patients compared with sepsis-1. In this 
experiment, we limited the study period to 28 days to restrict the potential of 
mortality caused by other factors. Additionally, we evaluated the clinical 
factors associated with the sepsis-1 or sepsis-3 and found out similar results 
in the analysis for sepsis-1 and sepsis-3.
CONCLUSIONS: The study results also portray numerous challenges in using the 
sepsis-3 criteria as a diagnostic tool. In particular, the ICD-10-CM diagnosis 
approach was limiting because it inhibited the measure of uncertainty of 
infection present at the beginning of the two diagnostic criteria of sepsis-1 
and sepsis-3.

PURPOSE: This study was aimed to identify the risk factors that influence the 
mortality risk in patients with acute aortic dissection (AAD) within one year 
after discharge, and aimed to construct a predictive model for assessing 
mortality risk.
METHODS: The study involved 320 adult patients obtained from the Medical 
Information Mart for Intensive Care (MIMIC) database. Logistic regression 
analysis was conducted to identify potential risk factors associated with 
mortality in AAD patients within one year after discharge and to develop a 
predictive model. The performance of the predictive model was assessed using the 
receiver operating characteristic curve (ROC), calibration curve, and decision 
curve analysis (DCA). To further validate the findings, patient data from the 
First Affiliated Hospital of Guangxi Medical University (157 patients) were 
analyzed.
RESULTS: Univariate and multivariate logistic regression analyses revealed that 
gender, length of hospital stay, highest blood urea nitrogen (BUN_max), use of 
adrenaline, and use of amiodarone were significant risk factors for mortality 
within one year after discharge (p < 0.05). The constructed model exhibited a 
consistency index (C-index) and an area under the ROC curve of 0.738. The 
calibration curve and DCA demonstrated that these indicators had a good degree 
of agreement and utility. The external validation results of the model also 
indicated good predictability (AUC = 0.700, p < 0.05).
CONCLUSION: The personalized scoring prediction model constructed by gender, 
length of hospital stays, BUN_max levels, as well as the use of adrenaline and 
amiodarone, can effectively identify AAD patients with high mortality risk 
within one year after discharge.

BACKGROUND: The relationship between the dynamic changes in insulin resistance 
(IR) and the prognosis of septic patients remains unclear. This study aims to 
investigate the correlation between the clinical subphenotype of IR represented 
by the triglyceride-glucose (TyG) index trajectory and the mortality rate among 
patients with sepsis.
METHODS: In this retrospective cohort study, we utilized data from septic 
patients within the Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care (MIMIC)-IV 
database version 2.0 to construct trajectories of the TyG index over 72 h. 
Subsequently, we computed the similarity among various TyG index trajectories 
with the dynamic time warping (DTW) algorithm and utilized the hierarchical 
clustering (HC) algorithm to demarcate distinct cluster and identified 
subphenotypes according to the trajectory trend. Subsequently, we assessed the 
mortality risk between different subphenotypes using analyses such as survival 
analysis and validated the robustness of the results through propensity score 
matching (PSM) and various models.
RESULTS: A total of 2350 patients were included in the study. Two trajectory 
trends: TyG index decreasing (n = 926) and TyG index increasing (n = 1424) were 
identified, which indicated corresponding to the clinical subphenotype of 
increased and alleviative IR respectively. The 28-day and in-hospital mortality 
for the increased IR group was 28.51% and 25.49% respectively. In comparison, 
patients in the alleviative IR group with a 28-day mortality of 23.54% and an 
in-hospital mortality of 21.60%. These subphenotypes exhibited distinct 
prognosis, time dependent Cox model showed the increased IR group with a higher 
28-day mortality [hazard ratio (HR): 1.07, 95% confidence interval (CI): 
1.02-1.12, P = 0.01] and in-hospital mortality [HR: 1.05, 95% CI: 1.00-1.11, 
P = 0.045] compared to the alleviative IR group. Sensitivity analyses with 
various models further validated the robustness of our findings.
CONCLUSION: Dynamic increase in the TyG index trajectory is associated with 
elevated mortality risk among patients with sepsis, which suggests that dynamic 
increased IR exacerbates the risk of poor outcomes in patients.

BACKGROUND: Lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) has been reported in multiple heart 
diseases. Herein, we explored the prognostic effects of preoperative LDH on 
adverse outcomes in cardiac surgery patients.
METHODS: Retrospective data analysis was conducted from two large medical 
databases: Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care (MIMIC) III and MIMIC IV 
databases. The primary outcome was in-hospital mortality, whereas the secondary 
outcomes were 1-year mortality, continuous renal replacement therapy, prolonged 
ventilation, and prolonged length of intensive care unit and hospital stay.
RESULTS: Patients with a primary endpoint had significantly higher levels of LDH 
(p < 0.001). Multivariate regression analysis presented that elevated LDH was 
independently correlated with increased risk of primary and secondary endpoints 
(all p < 0.001). Subgroup analyses showed that high LDH was consistently 
associated with primary endpoint. Moreover, LDH exhibited the highest area under 
the curve (0.768) for the prediction of primary endpoint compared to the other 
indicators, including neutrophil-lymphocyte ratio (NLR), lymphocyte-monocyte 
ratio (LMR), platelet-lymphocyte ratio (PLR), lactate, and simplified acute 
physiology score (SAPS) II. The above results were further confirmed in the 
MIMIC IV dataset.
CONCLUSIONS: Elevated preoperative LDH may be a robust predictor of poor 
prognosis in cardiac surgery patients, and its predictive ability is superior to 
NLR, LMR, PLR, lactate, and SAPS II.

BACKGROUND: To explore the influencing factors for in-hospital mortality in the 
neonatal intensive care unit (NICU) and to establish a predictive nomogram.
METHODS: Neonatal data were extracted from the Medical Information Mart for 
Intensive Care III (MIMIC-III) database. Both univariate and multivariate logit 
binomial general linear models were used to analyse the factors influencing 
neonatal death. The area under the receiver operating characteristics (ROC) 
curve was used to assess the predictive model, which was visualized by a 
nomogram.
RESULTS: A total of 1258 neonates from the NICU in the MIMIC-III database were 
eligible for the study, including 1194 surviving patients and 64 deaths. 
Multivariate analysis showed that red cell distribution width (RDW) (odds ratio 
[OR] 0.813, p=0.003) and total bilirubin (TBIL; OR 0.644, p<0.001) had 
protective effects on neonatal in-hospital death, while lymphocytes (OR 1.205, 
p=0.025), arterial partial pressure of carbon dioxide (PaCO2; OR 1.294, p=0.016) 
and sequential organ failure assessment (SOFA) score (OR 1.483, p<0.001) were 
its independent risk factors. Based on this, the area under the curve of this 
predictive model was up to 0.865 (95% confidence interval 0.813 to 0.917), which 
was also confirmed by a nomogram.
CONCLUSIONS: The nomogram constructed suggests that RDW, TBIL, lymphocytes, 
PaCO2 and SOFA score are all significant predictors for in-hospital mortality in 
the NICU.

OBJECTIVE: To develop machine learning models for predicting intensive care unit 
(ICU) readmission using ensemble learning algorithms.
METHODS: A publicly accessible American ICU database, medical information mart 
for intensive care (MIMIC)-Ⅲ as the data source was used, and the patients were 
selected by the inclusion and exclusion criteria. A set of variables that had 
the predictive ability of outcome including demographics, vital signs, 
laboratory tests, and comorbidities of patients were extracted from the dataset. 
We built the ICU readmission prediction models based on ensemble learning 
methods including random forest, adaptive boosting (AdaBoost), and gradient 
boosting decision tree (GBDT), and compared the prediction performance of the 
machine learning models with a conventional Logistic regression model. Five-fold 
cross validation was used to train and validate the prediction models. Average 
sensitivity, positive prediction value, negative prediction value, false 
positive rate, false negative rate, area under the receiver operating 
characteristic curve (AUROC) and Brier score were used as performance measures. 
After constructing the prediction models, top 10 predictive variables based on 
importance ranking were identified by the model with the best discrimination.
RESULTS: Among these ICU readmission prediction models, GBDT (AUROC=0.858) had 
better performance than random forest (AUROC=0.827), and was slightly superior 
to AdaBoost (AUROC=0.851) in terms of AUROC. Compared with Logistic regression 
(AUROC=0.810), the discrimination of the three ensemble learning models was much 
better. The feature importance provided by GBDT showed that the top ranking 
variables included vital signs and laboratory tests. The patients with ICU 
readmission had higher mean arterial pressure, systolic blood pressure, 
diastolic blood pressure, and heart rate than the patients without ICU 
readmission. Meanwhile, the patients readmitted to ICU experienced lower urine 
output and higher serum creatinine. Overall, the patients having repeated 
admissions during their hospitalization showed worse heart function and renal 
function compared with the patients without ICU readmission.
CONCLUSION: The ensemble learning based ICU readmission prediction models had 
better performance than Logistic regression model. Such ensemble learning models 
have the potential to aid ICU physicians in identifying those patients with high 
risk of ICU readmission and thus help improve overall clinical outcomes.

目的: 基于集成学习算法建立患者再入重症监护病房(intensive care unit, ICU)的风险预测模型，并比较各个模型的预测性能。
方法: 使用美国重症医学数据库(medical information mart for intensive 
care，MIMIC)-Ⅲ，根据纳入、排除标准筛选患者，提取人口学特征、生命体征、实验室检查、合并症等可能对结局有预测作用的变量，基于集成学习方法随机森林、自适应提升算法(adaptive 
boosting, AdaBoost)和梯度提升决策树(gradient boosting decision tree, 
GBDT)建立再入ICU预测模型，并比较集成学习与Logistic回归的预测性能。使用五折交叉验证后的平均灵敏度、阳性预测值、阴性预测值、假阳性率、假阴性率、受试者工作特征曲线下面积(area 
under the receiver operating characteristic 
curve，AUROC)和Brier评分评价模型效果，基于最佳性能模型给出重要性排序前10位的预测变量。
结果: 所有模型中，GBDT (AUROC=0.858)优于随机森林(AUROC=0.827)，略好于AdaBoost 
(AUROC=0.851)。与Logistic回归(AUROC=0.810)相比，集成学习算法在区分度上均有较大的提升。GBDT算法给出的变量重要性排序中，平均动脉压、收缩压、舒张压、心率、尿量、血肌酐等变量排序靠前，相对而言，再入ICU患者的心血管功能和肾功能更差。
结论: 
基于集成学习算法的患者再入ICU预测模型表现出较好的性能，优于Logistic回归。使用集成学习算法建立的再入ICU风险预测模型可用于识别再入ICU风险高的患者，医务人员可针对高风险患者采取干预措施，改善患者的整体临床结局。

BACKGROUND: There has not been a well-accepted prognostic model to predict the 
mortality of aortic aneurysm patients in intensive care unit after open surgery 
repair. Otherwise, our previous study found that anion gap was a prognosis 
factor for aortic aneurysm patients. Therefore, we wanted to investigate the 
relationship between anion gap and mortality of aortic aneurysm patients in 
intensive care unit after open surgery repair.
METHODS: From Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care III, data of aortic 
aneurysm patients in intensive care unit after open surgery were enrolled. The 
primary clinical outcome was defined as death in intensive care unit. Univariate 
analysis was conducted to compare the baseline data in different groups 
stratified by clinical outcome or by anion gap level. Restricted cubic spline 
was drawn to find out the association between anion gap level and mortality. 
Subgroup analysis was then conducted to show the association in different level 
and was presented as frost plot. Multivariate regression models were built based 
on anion gap and were adjusted by admission information, severity score, 
complication, operation and laboratory indicators. Receiver operating 
characteristic curves were drawn to compare the prognosis ability of anion gap 
and simplified acute physiology score II. Decision curve analysis was finally 
conducted to indicate the net benefit of the models.
RESULTS: A total of 405 aortic aneurysm patients were enrolled in this study and 
the in-intensive-care-unit (in-ICU) mortality was 6.9%. Univariate analysis 
showed that elevated anion gap was associated with high mortality (P 
value < 0.001), and restricted cubic spline analysis showed the positive 
correlation between anion gap and mortality. Receiver operating characteristic 
curve showed that the mortality predictive ability of anion gap approached that 
of simplified acute physiology score II and even performed better in predicting 
in-hospital mortality (P value < 0.05). Moreover, models based on anion gap 
showed that 1 mEq/L increase of anion gap improved up to 42.3% (95% confidence 
interval 28.5-59.8%) risk of death.
CONCLUSIONS: The level of serum anion gap was an important prognosis factor for 
aortic aneurysm mortality in intensive care unit after open surgery.

BACKGROUND: Although cancer patients are increasingly admitted to the intensive 
care unit (ICU) for cancer- or treatment-related complications, improved 
mortality prediction remains a big challenge. This study describes a new 
ML-based mortality prediction model for critically ill cancer patients admitted 
to ICU.
PATIENTS AND METHODS: We developed CanICU, a machine learning-based 28-day 
mortality prediction model for adult cancer patients admitted to ICU from 
Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care (MIMIC) database in the USA (n = 
766), Yonsei Cancer Center (YCC, n = 3571), and Samsung Medical Center in Korea 
(SMC, n = 2563) from 2 January 2008 to 31 December 2017. The accuracy of CanICU 
was measured using sensitivity, specificity, and area under the receiver 
operating curve (AUROC).
RESULTS: A total of 6900 patients were included, with a 28-day mortality of 
10.2%/12.7%/36.6% and a 1-year mortality of 30.0%/36.6%/58.5% in the YCC, SMC, 
and MIMIC-III cohort. Nine clinical and laboratory factors were used to 
construct the classifier using a random forest machine-learning algorithm. 
CanICU had 96% sensitivity/73% specificity with the area under the receiver 
operating characteristic (AUROC) of 0.94 for 28-day, showing better performance 
than current prognostic models, including the Acute Physiology and Chronic 
Health Evaluation (APACHE) or Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (SOFA) score. 
Application of CanICU in two external data sets across the countries yielded 
79-89% sensitivity, 58-59% specificity, and 0.75-0.78 AUROC for 28-day 
mortality. The CanICU score was also correlated with one-year mortality with 
88-93% specificity.
CONCLUSION: CanICU offers improved performance for predicting mortality in 
critically ill cancer patients admitted to ICU. A user-friendly online 
implementation is available and should be valuable for better mortality risk 
stratification to allocate ICU care for cancer patients.

AIMS: Hyperglycemia on admission is associated with poor prognosis in ischemic 
stroke (IS) patients. We aimed to investigate the relationship between stress 
hyperglycemia ratio (SHR) and short-term or long-term mortality in IS patients 
in the ICU and to explore whether this relationship is influenced by diabetes 
status.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: We collected patients with severe IS requiring ICU 
admission in the Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care (MIMIC-IV) database 
and calculated SHR. Outcomes included 30-day, 90-day, and 1-year mortality. The 
association between SHR and mortality in patients with critical IS was 
elucidated using Multivariate Cox regression and subgroup analysis for diabetes.
RESULTS: A total of 1376 patients were recruited. After adjusting for potential 
confounders, patients in the third and fourth quartiles had a significantly 
increased risk of death at 30 days, 90 days, and 1 year compared to the first 
quartile of SHR (Q3 vs. Q1: HR 1.56-1.80, all p < 0.02; Q4 vs. Q1: HR 1.75-2.15, 
all p < 0.001; all p for trend < 0.001). In addition, the highest quartile of 
SHR was significantly associated with short-term or long-term mortality compared 
with the first quartile, regardless of diabetes status.
CONCLUSIONS: Our results suggest that stress hyperglycemia, defined by the 
glucose/HbA1c ratio, is associated with increased short-term and long-term 
mortality in patients with ischemic stroke, independent of the patient's 
diabetes status.

This study was to preview the risk of 30-day mortality in sepsis patients using 
sentiment analysis. The clinical data of patients and nursing notes were 
collected from the Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care (MIMIC-III) 
database. The factors influencing 30-day mortality were analyzed using the Cox 
regression model. And, the prognostic index (PI) was estimated. The receiver 
operating characteristic (ROC) curve was used to determine the PI cut-off point 
and assess the prediction ability of the model. In total, 1844 of 3560 patients 
were eligible for the study, with a 30-day mortality of 37.58%. Multivariate Cox 
analysis showed that sentiment polarity scores, sentiment subjectivity scores, 
simplified acute physiology score (SAPS)-II, age, and intensive care unit (ICU) 
types were all associated with the risk of 30-day mortality (P < 0.05). In the 
preview of 30-day mortality, the area under the curve (AUC) of ROC was 0.78 
(95%CI: 0.74-0.81,P < 0.001) when the cut-off point of PI was 0.467. The 
documented notes from nurses were described for the first time. Sentiment scores 
measured in nursing notes are associated with the risk of 30-day mortality in 
sepsis patients and may improve the preview of 30-day mortality.

BACKGROUND: Intensive care unit (ICU) readmissions are associated with mortality 
and poor outcomes. To improve discharge decisions, machine learning (ML) could 
help to identify patients at risk of ICU readmission. However, as many models 
are black boxes, dangerous properties may remain unnoticed. Widely used post hoc 
explanation methods also have inherent limitations. Few studies are evaluating 
inherently interpretable ML models for health care and involve clinicians in 
inspecting the trained model.
METHODS: An inherently interpretable model for the prediction of 3 day ICU 
readmission was developed. We used explainable boosting machines that learn 
modular risk functions and which have already been shown to be suitable for the 
health care domain. We created a retrospective cohort of 15,589 ICU stays and 
169 variables collected between 2006 and 2019 from the University Hospital 
Münster. A team of physicians inspected the model, checked the plausibility of 
each risk function, and removed problematic ones. We collected qualitative 
feedback during this process and analyzed the reasons for removing risk 
functions. The performance of the final explainable boosting machine was 
compared with a validated clinical score and three commonly used ML models. 
External validation was performed on the widely used Medical Information Mart 
for Intensive Care version IV database.
RESULTS: The developed explainable boosting machine used 67 features and showed 
an area under the precision-recall curve of 0.119 ± 0.020 and an area under the 
receiver operating characteristic curve of 0.680 ± 0.025. It performed on par 
with state-of-the-art gradient boosting machines (0.123 ± 0.016, 0.665 ± 0.036) 
and outperformed the Simplified Acute Physiology Score II (0.084 ± 0.025, 0.607 
± 0.019), logistic regression (0.092 ± 0.026, 0.587 ± 0.016), and recurrent 
neural networks (0.095 ± 0.008, 0.594 ± 0.027). External validation confirmed 
that explainable boosting machines (0.221 ± 0.023, 0.760 ± 0.010) performed 
similarly to gradient boosting machines (0.232 ± 0.029, 0.772 ± 0.018). 
Evaluation of the model inspection showed that explainable boosting machines can 
be useful to detect and remove problematic risk functions.
CONCLUSIONS: We developed an inherently interpretable ML model for 3 day ICU 
readmission prediction that reached the state-of-the-art performance of black 
box models. Our results suggest that for low- to medium-dimensional datasets 
that are common in health care, it is feasible to develop ML models that allow a 
high level of human control without sacrificing performance.

BACKGROUND: Sepsis-associated acute kidney injury (S-AKI) is a major contributor 
to mortality in intensive care units (ICU). Early prediction of mortality risk 
is crucial to enhance prognosis and optimize clinical decisions. This study aims 
to develop a 28-day mortality risk prediction model for S-AKI utilizing an 
explainable ensemble machine learning (ML) algorithm.
METHODS: This study utilized data from the Medical Information Mart for 
Intensive Care IV (MIMIC-IV 2.0) database to gather information on patients with 
S-AKI. Univariate regression, correlation analysis and Boruta were combined for 
feature selection. To construct the four ML models, hyperparameters were tuned 
via random search and five-fold cross-validation. To evaluate the performance of 
all models, ROC, K-S, and LIFT curves were used. The discrimination of ML models 
and traditional scoring systems was compared using area under the receiver 
operating characteristic curve (AUC). Additionally, the SHapley Additive 
exPlanation (SHAP) was utilized to interpret the ML model and identify essential 
variables. To investigate the relationship between the top nine continuous 
variables and the risk of 28-day mortality. COX regression-restricted cubic 
splines were utilized while controlling for age and comorbidities.
RESULTS: The study analyzed data from 9,158 patients with S-AKI, dividing them 
into a 28-day mortality group of 1,940 and a survival group of 7,578. The 
results showed that XGBoost was the best performing model of the four ML models 
with AUC of 0.873. All models outperformed APS-III 0.713 and SAPS-II 0.681. The 
K-S and LIFT curves indicated XGBoost as the most effective predictor for 28-day 
mortality risk. The model's performance was evaluated using ROCpr curves, 
calibration curves, accuracy, precision, and F1 scores. SHAP force plots were 
utilized to interpret and visualize the personalized predictive power of the 
28-day mortality risk model. Additionally, COX regression restricted cubic 
splines revealed an interesting non-linear relationship between the top nine 
variables and 28-day mortality.
CONCLUSION: The use of ensemble ML models has shown to be more effective than 
the LR model and conventional scoring systems in predicting 28-day mortality 
risk in S-AKI patients. By visualizing the XGBoost model with the best 
predictive performance, clinicians are able to identify high-risk patients early 
on and improve prognosis.

BACKGROUND: Understanding the relationship between nutrition risk at admission 
to the intensive care unit (ICU) and the prognosis of patients with traumatic 
brain injury (TBI) may aid early recognition of high-risk patients.
METHODS: We extracted data from the Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care 
III and the electronic ICU Collaborative Research Databases. Using modified 
Nutrition Risk in the Critically ill score (mNUTRIC) within the first 24 h of 
ICU admission, 5153 patients were divided into three groups: low (≤1, n = 1765), 
moderate (2-4, n = 2574), and high (≥5, n = 814). The primary outcome was 28-day 
in-hospital mortality, and the secondary outcomes were 7-day in-hospital 
mortality, length of ICU stay, and duration of mechanical ventilation.
RESULTS: During the median follow-up time of 6.69 days, 647 deaths occurred in 
total. After adjustment for potential confounding factors, setting the low 
mNUTRIC group as a reference, the risk of 28-day mortality was increased in the 
high and moderate mNUTRIC groups (hazard ratio [HR]high vs low [95% CI]: 4.21 
[2.70-6.58] and 2.84 [1.95-4.14], respectively). Similarly, high and moderate 
mNUTRIC scores are linked to a higher risk of 7-day mortality (PTrend  < 0.001) 
and a longer duration of mechanical ventilation (PTrend  < 0.001). The effect of 
mNUTRIC on mortality varied by serum glucose level (PInteraction  = 0.01). 
Lastly, those whose mNUTRIC scores deteriorated within the first 3 days have a 
1.46 times greater risk of dying compared with patients with improved mNUTRIC 
scores.
CONCLUSIONS: Nutrition risk screening by mNUTRIC score at the time of admission 
to the ICU may improve mortality prediction.

OBJECTIVE: Sepsis is a serious complication of acute cholangitis. We aimed to 
establish a nomogram for predicting the probability of sepsis in patients with 
acute cholangitis.
METHODS: Subjects were patients with acute cholangitis in the Medical 
Information Mart for Intensive Care database. Extraneous variables were excluded 
based on stepwise regression. The nomogram was established using logistic 
regression.
RESULTS: The predictive model comprised five variables: age (odds ratio [OR]: 
1.03, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.01–1.04), ventilator-support time (OR: 
1.004, 95% CI: 1.001–1.008), diabetes (OR: 10.74, 95% CI: 2.80–70.57), 
coagulopathy (OR: 2.92, 95% CI: 1.83–4.73) and systolic blood pressure (OR: 
0.62, 95% CI: 0.41–0.93). The areas under the receiver operating characteristic 
curve of the nomogram for the training and validation sets were 0.700 and 0.647, 
respectively. The Hosmer–Lemeshow goodness-of-fit test revealed high concordance 
between the predicted and observed probabilities for both the training and 
validation sets. The calibration plot also demonstrated good agreement between 
the predicted and observed outcomes for both the training and validation sets.
CONCLUSIONS: We developed and validated a risk-prediction model for sepsis in 
patients with acute cholangitis. Our results will be helpful for preventing 
sepsis in patients with acute cholangitis.

BACKGROUND: Mechanical ventilation remains one of the primary management 
measures for critically ill patients in intensive care units (ICUs). However, 
previous studies on the prognosis prediction of ICU patients received mechanical 
ventilation were limited. This study was to develop and validate a nomogram for 
predicting short- and long-term survival among patients who received mechanical 
ventilation in the ICU.
METHODS: This was a retrospective cohort study with a 3-year follow-up. 
Demographic, laboratory, clinical data of 16,775 participants aged ≥18 years who 
received mechanical ventilation in the ICU were extracted from the Medical 
Information Mart for Intensive Care III (MIMIC-III) database. The outcomes of 
this study were 1-month, 3-month, 1-year, and 3-year survival. All eligible 
patients were randomly classified into the training and testing groups with a 
ratio of 7:3. A multivariate Cox regression in the training group was used to 
explore the predictors and develop the predictive nomogram. Internal and 
subgroup validations were performed, and the C-index was calculated to estimate 
the predictive performance of the nomogram. The time-dependent receiver 
operating characteristic curves were drawn, and corresponding areas under the 
curve (AUC) were calculated.
RESULTS: Totally 6,291 patients died during the follow-up duration. Age, gender, 
ethnicity, ICU type, comorbidity, days of mechanical ventilation, white blood 
cell count, blood urea nitrogen, the fraction of inspiration O2, Sequential 
Organ Failure Assessment scores, and the Glasgow coma score were predictors of 
the survival of ICU patients who received mechanical ventilation (P<0.05). The 
C-index of the nomogram was 0.819 and was validated in the testing group at 
0.816. The AUCs for the prognostic nomogram for 1-month, 3-month, 1-year, and 
3-year survival were 0.889, 0.892, 0.882, and 0.866, respectively.
CONCLUSIONS: This nomogram showed good predictive performance for short- and 
long-term survival in ICU patients treated with mechanical ventilation, which 
may be a useful tool for clinicians to assess the prognosis of patients and to 
adjust treatment strategies in time.

BACKGROUND: Acute kidney injury (AKI) is more likely to develop in the elderly 
admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU). Acute kidney disease (AKD) affects 
∼45% of patients with AKI and increases short-term mortality. However, there are 
no studies on the prognosis of AKD in the elderly.
METHODS: Data from 2666 elderly patients with AKD in the Medical Information 
Mart for Intensive Care IV were used for model development and 535 in the eICU 
Collaborative Research Database for external validation. Based on 5 machine 
learning algorithms, 33 noninvasive parameters were extracted as features for 
modeling.
RESULTS: In-hospital mortality of AKD in the elderly was 29.6% and 31.8% in 
development and validation cohorts, respectively. The comprehensive 
best-performing algorithm was the support vector machine (SVM), and a simplified 
online application included only 10 features employing SVM (AUC: 0.810 and 0.776 
in the training and external validation cohorts, respectively) was deployed. 
Model interpretation by SHapley Additive exPlanation (SHAP) values revealed that 
the difference (AKD day - ICU day) in sequential organ failure assessment (delta 
SOFA), Glasgow coma scale (GCS), delta GCS, delta peripheral oxygen saturation 
(SpO2), and SOFA were the top five features associated with prognosis. The 
optimal target was determined by SHAP values from partial dependence plots.
CONCLUSIONS: A web-based tool was externally validated and deployed to predict 
the early prognosis of AKD in the elderly based on readily available noninvasive 
parameters, assisting clinicians in intervening with precision and purpose to 
save lives to the greatest extent.

BACKGROUND: The main purpose of this study was to explore the predictive value 
of the systemic immune inflammation index (SII), a novel clinical marker, in 
heart failure (HF) patients.
METHODS: Critically ill patients with HF were identified from the Medical 
Information Mart for Intensive Care III (MIMIC III) database. Patients were 
divided into three groups according to tertiles of SII (group 1, group 2, group 
3). We used Kaplan-Meier curves and Cox proportional hazards regression models 
to evaluate the association between the SII and all-cause mortality in HF. 
Subgroup analysis was used to verify the predictive effect of the SII on 
mortality.
RESULTS: This study included 9107 patients with a diagnosis of HF from the MIMIC 
III database. After 30, 60, 180, and 365 days of follow-up, 25.60%, 32.10%, 
41.30%, and 47.50% of the patients in group 3 had died. Using the Kaplan-Meier 
curve, we observed that patients with higher SII values had a shorter survival 
time (log rank p < 0.001). The Cox proportional hazards regression model 
adjusted for all possible confounders and indicated that the higher SII group 
had a higher mortality (30-day: HR = 1.304, 95%CI = 1.161 - 1.465, 60-day: HR = 
1.266, 95% CI = 1.120 - 1.418, 180-day: HR = 1.274, 95%CI = 1.163 - 1.395, and 
365-day: HR = 1.255, 95%CI = 1.155 - 1.364).
CONCLUSIONS: SII values could be used as a predictor of prognosis in critically 
ill patients with HF.

BACKGROUND: In-hospital mortality, prolonged length of stay (LOS), and 30-day 
readmission are common outcomes in the intensive care unit (ICU). Traditional 
scoring systems and machine learning models for predicting these outcomes 
usually ignore the characteristics of ICU data, which are time-series forms. We 
aimed to use time-series deep learning models with the selective combination of 
three widely used scoring systems to predict these outcomes.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: A retrospective cohort study was conducted on 40,083 
patients in ICU from the Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care-IV 
(MIMIC-IV) database. Three deep learning models, namely, recurrent neural 
network (RNN), gated recurrent unit (GRU), and long short-term memory (LSTM) 
with attention mechanisms, were trained for the prediction of in-hospital 
mortality, prolonged LOS, and 30-day readmission with variables collected during 
the initial 24 h after ICU admission or the last 24 h before discharge. The 
inclusion of variables was based on three widely used scoring systems, namely, 
APACHE II, SOFA, and SAPS II, and the predictors consisted of time-series vital 
signs, laboratory tests, medication, and procedures. The patients were randomly 
divided into a training set (80%) and a test set (20%), which were used for 
model development and model evaluation, respectively. The area under the 
receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC), sensitivity, specificity, and 
Brier scores were used to evaluate model performance. Variable significance was 
identified through attention mechanisms.
RESULTS: A total of 33 variables for 40,083 patients were enrolled for mortality 
and prolonged LOS prediction and 36,180 for readmission prediction. The rates of 
occurrence of the three outcomes were 9.74%, 27.54%, and 11.79%, respectively. 
In each of the three outcomes, the performance of RNN, GRU, and LSTM did not 
differ greatly. Mortality prediction models, prolonged LOS prediction models, 
and readmission prediction models achieved AUCs of 0.870 ± 0.001, 0.765 ± 0.003, 
and 0.635 ± 0.018, respectively. The top significant variables co-selected by 
the three deep learning models were Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS), age, blood urea 
nitrogen, and norepinephrine for mortality; GCS, invasive ventilation, and blood 
urea nitrogen for prolonged LOS; and blood urea nitrogen, GCS, and ethnicity for 
readmission.
CONCLUSION: The prognostic prediction models established in our study achieved 
good performance in predicting common outcomes of patients in ICU, especially in 
mortality prediction. In addition, GCS and blood urea nitrogen were identified 
as the most important factors strongly associated with adverse ICU events.

BACKGROUND The growing number of patients with Alzheimer disease worldwide has 
become a leading public concern. Whether Alzheimer disease has an impact on the 
outcomes of critically ill patients remains unclear; therefore, we conducted 
this study to evaluate comorbid Alzheimer disease in patients in the Intensive 
Care Unit (ICU). MATERIAL AND METHODS Data were extracted from the Medical 
Information Mart for Intensive Care-III database, version 1.4. Patients were 
divided into an Alzheimer disease group and a non-Alzheimer disease group. 
Differences in all-cause mortality, length of hospital stay, mechanical 
ventilation rate, and mechanical ventilation duration were analyzed. Propensity 
score matching (PSM) was performed to compensate for differences in baseline 
characteristics. The differences in prognosis were compared between groups after 
PSM. Survival analyses in patients were performed and Cox regression analyses 
were used to predict prognoses. RESULTS We included 33 935 patients, among which 
433 patients were comorbid with Alzheimer disease. After PSM, there were no 
significant differences in 7-day mortality, but there were significant 
differences in 28-day mortality (P=0.047) and 90-day mortality (P=0.012) between 
the 2 groups. There was also a significant difference in the 4-year cumulative 
survival between the 2 groups (P<0.001). In all patients undergoing surgery, 
multivariate Cox regression analysis showed that Alzheimer disease comorbidity 
was significantly associated with 90-day mortality and 4-year mortality. 
CONCLUSIONS Critical ill patients with Alzheimer disease had higher 28-day and 
90-day mortality. Especially for patients undergoing surgery, Alzheimer disease 
is an independent risk factor affecting long-term survival.

BACKGROUND: Malnutrition is a common occurrence in critically ill patients, and 
has been related to poor prognosis in various diseases. Here, we assess the 
prognostic value of malnutrition using nutritional indices in intensive care 
units (ICU) patients.
METHODS: We retrieved information on 2060 patients from the Medical Information 
Mart for Intensive Care III, and randomized the patients into training and 
validation cohorts, at a ratio of 7:3. We estimated their nutritional indices 
using prognostic nutritional index (PNI), geriatric nutritional risk index 
(GNRI), and controlling nutritional status (CONUT) score. Both multivariate 
regression analysis and the Kaplan-Meier (KM) survival curve were used to 
examine the prognostic role of nutritional indices in ICU mortality. Then we 
evaluated the additional predictive significance of each nutritional index 
beyond the baseline model including conventional risk factors.
RESULTS: Multivariate regression analysis revealed that PNI, GNRI, and CONUT 
were independent predictors of in-hospital and 1-year mortality (all P < 0.001). 
KM curves showed higher 1-year mortality rates in having nutritional risk 
patients (PNI ≤ 38 or GNRI ≤ 98 or CONUT ≥ 2). Moreover, subgroup analyses 
revealed a significant association between each nutritional index and 1-year 
mortality in patients with different comorbidities. We also observed a 
pronounced additional impact on the predictive value of 1-year mortality when 
PNI, GNRI, and CONUT were separately added to the baseline model. The additional 
role of each nutritional index was further verified in the validation cohort.
CONCLUSIONS: Our results revealed that the nutritional indices at admission are 
significantly correlated with increased mortality rates in ICU adult patients.

INTRODUCTION: Septic patients requiring intensive care unit (ICU) readmission 
are at high risk of mortality, but research focusing on the association of ICU 
readmission due to sepsis and mortality is limited. The aim of this study was to 
develop and validate a machine learning (ML) model for predicting in-hospital 
mortality in septic patients readmitted to the ICU using routinely available 
clinical data.
METHODS: The data used in this study were obtained from the Medical Information 
Mart for Intensive Care (MIMIC-IV, v1.0) database, between 2008 and 2019. The 
study cohort included patients with sepsis requiring ICU readmission. The data 
were randomly split into a training (75%) data set and a validation (25%) data 
set. Nine popular ML models were developed to predict mortality in septic 
patients readmitted to the ICU. The model with the best accuracy and area under 
the curve (A.C.) in the validation cohort was defined as the optimal model and 
was selected for further prediction studies. The SHAPELY Additive explanations 
(SHAP) values and Local Interpretable Model-Agnostic Explanation (LIME) methods 
were used to improve the interpretability of the optimal model.
RESULTS: A total of 1117 septic patients who had required ICU readmission during 
the study period were enrolled in the study. Of these participants, 434 (38.9%) 
were female, and the median (interquartile range [IQR]) age was 68.6 (58.4-79.2) 
years. The median (IQR) ICU interval duration was 2.60 (0.64-5.78) days. After 
feature selection, 31 of 47 clinical factors were ultimately chosen for use in 
model construction. Of the nine ML models tested, the best performance was 
achieved with the random forest (RF) model, with an A.C. of 0.81, an accuracy of 
85% and a precision of 62% in the validation cohort. The SHAP summary analysis 
revealed that Glasgow Coma Scale score, urine output, blood urea nitrogen, 
lactate, platelet count and systolic blood pressure were the top six most 
important factors contributing to the RF model. Additionally, the LIME method 
demonstrated how the RF model works in terms of explaining risk of death 
prediction in septic patients requiring ICU readmission.
CONCLUSION: The ML models reported here showed a good prognostic prediction 
ability in septic patients requiring ICU readmission. Of the features selected, 
the parameters related to organ perfusion made the largest contribution to 
outcome prediction during ICU readmission in septic patients.

A high serum anion gap (AG) at the time of patient admission can lead to the 
deterioration or even death; data are lacking for patients who suffer acute 
heart failure (AHF). The present study aimed at exploring the impact of serum AG 
(SAG) levels on the in-hospital mortality in AHF patients. The study conducted 
retrospective analysis on the data from the medical information mart for 
intensive care (MIMIC-IV) database in severe AHF cases. Serum AG, age, sex, 
concomitant diseases and laboratory tests were collected from patients at 
admission. Multivariate Cox proportional hazard regression model together with 
Kaplan Meier (K-M) survival curve served for analyzing the relationship of serum 
AG with the hospital all-cause mortality (ACM). In addition, subgroup analysis 
assisted in assessing the concordance. Data from 2774 AHF patients were 
collected in the study. The hospital ACM rate was 9.2% (254/2774). After 
correcting potential confounders, multivariate analysis compared the high serum 
AG level (≥ 16 mmol/L) and the low serum AG level (< 16 mmol/L) (hazard ratio 
(HR): 1.89 [95% CI 1.42-2.51]). In a similar way, K-M survival curve indicated 
that hospital survival was lower in patients with high serum, suggesting that 
high serum AG level could lead to poor AHF prognosis. In patients with AHF, high 
serum AG level could increase the hospital ACM.

BACKGROUND: Serum lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) is a nonspecific inflammatory 
biomarker and has been reported to be associated with pneumonia prognosis. This 
study aimed to evaluate the relationship between LDH levels and 
ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) risk in intensive care unit (ICU) 
patients.
METHODS: This retrospective cohort study used data from the Multiparameter 
Intelligent Monitoring in Intensive Care database from 2001 to 2019. ICU 
patients aged ≥ 18 years and receiving mechanical ventilation were included. LDH 
levels were analyzed as continuous and categorical variables (< 210, 210-279, 
279-390, > 390 IU/L), respectively. Restricted cubic spline (RCS) curves and 
quartiles were used to categorize LDH levels. Logistic regression and linear 
regression were utilized to assess the relationship of LDH levels with VAP risk 
and duration of mechanical ventilation, respectively.
RESULTS: A total of 9,164 patients were enrolled, of which 646 (7.05%) patients 
developed VAP. High levels of LDH increased the risk of VAP [odds ratio 
(OR) = 1.15, 95% confidence interval (CI): 1.06-1.24] and LDH levels were 
positively correlated with the duration of mechanical ventilation [β = 4.49, 
95%CI: (3.42, 5.56)]. Moreover, patients with LDH levels of 279-390 IU/L 
(OR = 1.38, 95%CI: 1.08-1.76) and > 390 IU/L (OR = 1.50, 95%CI: 1.18-1.90) had a 
higher risk of VAP than patients with LDH levels < 210 IU/L. Patients with LDH 
levels of 279-390 IU/L [β = 3.84, 95%CI: (0.86, 6.82)] and > 390 IU/L 
[β = 11.22, 95%CI: (8.21, 14.22)] (vs. <210 IU/L) had a longer duration of 
mechanical ventilation.
CONCLUSION: Elevated serum LDH levels were related to a higher risk of VAP and 
longer duration of mechanical ventilation and may be useful for monitoring VAP 
risk.

RESEARCH OBJECTIVES: Clostriodiodes difficile infection (CDI) is a major cause 
of healthcare-associated diarrhoea with high mortality. There is a lack of 
validated predictors for severe outcomes in CDI. The aim of this study is to 
derive and validate a clinical prediction tool for CDI in-hospital mortality 
using a large critical care database.
METHODOLOGY: The demographics, clinical parameters, laboratory results and 
mortality of CDI were extracted from the Medical Information Mart for Intensive 
Care-III (MIMIC-III) database. We subsequently trained three machine learning 
models: logistic regression (LR), random forest (RF) and gradient boosting 
machine (GBM) to predict in-hospital mortality. The individual performances of 
the models were compared against current severity scores (Clostridiodes 
difficile Associated Risk of Death Score (CARDS) and ATLAS (Age, Treatment with 
systemic antibiotics, leukocyte count, Albumin and Serum creatinine as a measure 
of renal function) by calculating area under receiver operating curve (AUROC). 
We identified factors associated with higher mortality risk in each model.
SUMMARY OF RESULTS: From 61 532 intensive care unit stays in the MIMIC-III 
database, there were 1315 CDI cases. The mortality rate for CDI in the study 
cohort was 18.33%. AUROC was 0.69 (95% CI, 0.60 to 0.76) for LR, 0.71 (95% CI, 
0.62 to 0.77) for RF and 0.72 (95% CI, 0.64 to 0.78) for GBM, while previously 
AUROC was 0.57 (95% CI, 0.51 to 0.65) for CARDS and 0.63 (95% CI, 0.54 to 0.70) 
for ATLAS. Albumin, lactate and bicarbonate were significant mortality factors 
for all the models. Free calcium, potassium, white blood cell, urea, platelet 
and mean blood pressure were present in at least two of the three models.
CONCLUSION: Our machine learning derived CDI in-hospital mortality prediction 
model identified pertinent factors that can assist critical care clinicians in 
identifying patients at high risk of dying from CDI.

BACKGROUND: The prognosis of patients with alcohol-associated cirrhosis (ALC) 
admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) is poor. We developed and validated a 
nomogram (NIALC) for ICU patients with ALC.
METHODS: Predictors of mortality were defined by a machine learning method in a 
cohort of 394 ICU patients with ALC from the Medical Information Mart for 
Intensive Care database. Then the nomogram (NIALC) was constructed and evaluated 
using the AUC. The MELD, MELD-sodium, Child-Pugh, and CLIF-SOFA scores were then 
compared with NIALC. Two datasets of 394 and 501 ICU patients with ALC were 
utilized for model validation.
RESULTS: In-hospital mortality was 41% and 21% in the training and external 
validation sets. Predictors included were blood urea nitrogen, total bilirubin, 
prothrombin time, serum creatinine, lactate, partial thromboplastin time, 
phosphate, mean arterial pressure, lymphocytes, fibrinogen, and albumin. The 
AUCs for the NIALC were 0.767 and 0.760 in the two validation cohorts, which 
were better than those of the MELD, MELD-sodium, Child-Pugh, and CLIF-SOFA.
CONCLUSION: We developed a nomogram for ICU patients with ALC, which 
demonstrated better discriminative ability than previous prognostic scores. This 
nomogram could be conveniently used to facilitate the individualized prediction 
of death in ICU patients with ALC.

Pan-Immune-Inflammation Value (PIV) has recently received more attention as a 
novel indicator of inflammation. We aimed to evaluate the association between 
PIV and prognosis in septic patients. Data were extracted from the Medical 
Information Mart for Intensive Care IV database. The primary and secondary 
outcomes were 28-day and 90-day mortality. The association between PIV and 
outcomes was assessed by Kaplan-Meier curves, Cox regression analysis, 
restricted cubic spline curves and subgroup analysis. A total of 11,331 septic 
patients were included. Kaplan-Meier curves showed that septic patients with 
higher PIV had lower 28-day survival rate. In multivariable Cox regression 
analysis, log2-PIV was positively associated with the risk of 28-day mortality 
[HR (95% CI) 1.06 (1.03, 1.09), P < 0.001]. The relationship between log2-PIV 
and 28-day mortality was non-linear with a predicted inflection point at 8. To 
the right of the inflection point, high log2-PIV was associated with an 
increased 28-day mortality risk [HR (95% CI) 1.13 (1.09, 1.18), P < 0.001]. 
However, to the left of this point, this association was non-significant [HR 
(95% CI) 1.01 (0.94, 1.08), P = 0.791]. Similar results were found for 90-day 
mortality. Our study showed a non-linear relationship between PIV and 28-day and 
90-day mortality risk in septic patients.

BACKGROUND: Acute kidney injury is common in patients with sepsis and 
contributes to poor prognosis and mortality. Early identification of high-risk 
patients can provide evidence for clinical decision-making.
METHODS: We developed a prediction model based on a cohort of 15,726 patients 
with sepsis from the Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care III critical 
care database. Logistic regression analysis was applied to develop a prediction 
model incorporating the selected risk factors. Discrimination and calibration of 
the prediction model were assessed using the C-index and calibration plot.
RESULTS: Risk factors in the prediction model included diabetes mellitus, 
chronic kidney disease, congestive heart failure, chronic liver disease, 
hyperbicarbonemia, hyperglycemia, low blood pH, prolonged clotting time, 
hypotension, and hyperlactatemia. The model showed great discrimination with a 
C-index of 0.711 (95% CI, 0.702-0.721) and appropriate calibration. A medium 
C-index value of 0.712 (95% CI, 0.697-0.727) could still be reached in the 
validation cohort. Negative and positive predictive values for the optimal 
cutoff value of ≥6 points were 56.8% and 72.3% in the training cohort and 57.3% 
and 72.6% in the validation cohort, respectively.
CONCLUSIONS: This prediction model allows clinicians to quickly assess the risk 
of sepsis-associated acute kidney injury (SA-AKI) at an early stage. 
Accordingly, clinicians can implement more medical measures that are considered 
beneficial to patients with sepsis.

Objectives: This study aimed to analyze clinical characteristics and outcomes of 
critically ill patients with multiple myeloma (MM) admitted to the intensive 
care unit (ICU) and identify predictors of poor short-term prognosis. Methods: 
Data for patients with MM admitted to the ICU were extracted from the Medical 
Information Mart for Intensive Care III database. The risk factors leading to 
the ICU and hospital mortality were evaluated using logistic regression 
analysis. Results: Of 126 patients identified, 17 (13.5%) and 37 (29.4%) died in 
the ICU and hospital, respectively. Patients with ICU mortality showed higher 
median blood urea nitrogen (57.0 vs. 29.0) and poorer Acute Physiology Scores 
(APS, 70.0 vs. 46.0) than did surviving patients on the day of ICU admission. 
In-ICU deceased patients had higher proportion of mechanical ventilation (64.7% 
vs. 26.6%) and vasopressor use (64.7% vs. 17.4%) at admission and positive 
pathogenic culture during ICU stay (58.8% vs. 19.3%). The APS and positive 
pathogenic culture were independent prognostic factors for ICU mortality, while 
risk factors for hospital mortality included higher APS and relapsed/refractory 
disease. Conclusion: The short-term prognoses for patients with MM admitted to 
the ICU were mainly determined by the severity of organ failure, infection, and 
disease status.

BACKGROUND: Eosinophils are pro-inflammatory cells involved in thrombosis and 
have been proposed as a prognosis marker in acute ischemic stroke and 
ST-elevation myocardial Infarction. Here, we sought to clarify the prognostic 
value of eosinophil percentage (EOS%) in patients with acute type A aortic 
dissection (AAAD).
METHODS: We examined 183 consecutive AAAD patients. Based on the optimum cut-off 
value of EOS% determined by X-tile software, patients were classified into the 
low EOS% (EOS% ≤ 0.1) and high EOS% groups (EOS% > 0.1). We performed 
multivariate regression analysis and Kaplan-Meier (KM) survival curves to assess 
the association between EOS% and mortality. Eosinophil accumulation in aortic 
dissection intraluminal thrombus was confirmed using hematoxylin-eosin (H&E) 
staining. An external cohort from Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care IV 
was performed to validate the results.
RESULTS: Relative to surviving patients, those who died during hospitalization 
had significantly lower EOS% (p = 0.001) but significantly higher WBC 
(p = 0.002) and neutrophil (p = 0.001) counts. Multivariate regression analysis 
identified EOS% as an independent predictor of in-hospital and 1-year mortality. 
KM curves revealed that 1-year cumulative mortality was significantly higher in 
the low EOS% group, although it was mainly attributed to the higher 30-day 
mortality. H&E staining revealed massive infiltration of eosinophils in all 20 
thrombus specimens. The external validation confirmed that relative to 
survivors, patients with in-hospital mortality (p = 0.010) had significantly 
lower EOS%. Moreover, multivariate regression analyses identified that decreased 
EOS% was independently significantly associated with in-hospital mortality.
CONCLUSIONS: Low EOS% is significantly related to increased mortality rates in 
AAAD patients.

Background: Many severity scores are widely used for clinical outcome prediction 
for critically ill patients in the intensive care unit (ICU). However, for 
patients identified by sepsis-3 criteria, none of these have been developed. 
This study aimed to develop and validate a risk stratification score for 
mortality prediction in sepsis-3 patients. Methods: In this retrospective cohort 
study, we employed the Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care III (MIMIC 
III) database for model development and the eICU database for external 
validation. We identified septic patients by sepsis-3 criteria on day 1 of ICU 
entry. The Least Absolute Shrinkage and Selection Operator (LASSO) technique was 
performed to select predictive variables. We also developed a sepsis mortality 
prediction model and associated risk stratification score. We then compared 
model discrimination and calibration with other traditional severity scores. 
Results: For model development, we enrolled a total of 5,443 patients fulfilling 
the sepsis-3 criteria. The 30-day mortality was 16.7%. With 5,658 septic 
patients in the validation set, there were 1,135 deaths (mortality 20.1%). The 
score had good discrimination in development and validation sets (area under 
curve: 0.789 and 0.765). In the validation set, the calibration slope was 0.862, 
and the Brier value was 0.140. In the development dataset, the score divided 
patients according to mortality risk of low (3.2%), moderate (12.4%), high 
(30.7%), and very high (68.1%). The corresponding mortality in the validation 
dataset was 2.8, 10.5, 21.1, and 51.2%. As shown by the decision curve analysis, 
the score always had a positive net benefit. Conclusion: We observed moderate 
discrimination and calibration for the score termed Sepsis Mortality Risk Score 
(SMRS), allowing stratification of patients according to mortality risk. 
However, we still require further modification and external validation.

University, Chongqing, China.

BACKGROUND: Subarachnoid hemorrhage has a high rate of disability and mortality, 
and the ability to use existing disease severity scores to estimate the risk of 
adverse outcomes is limited. Collect relevant information of patients during 
hospitalization to develop more accurate risk prediction models, using logistic 
regression (LR) and machine learning (ML) technologies, combined with 
biochemical information.
METHODS: Patient-level data were extracted from MIMIC-IV data. The primary 
outcome was in-hospital mortality. The models were trained and tested on a data 
set (ratio 70:30) including age and key past medical history. The recursive 
feature elimination (RFE) algorithm was used to screen the characteristic 
variables; then, the ML algorithm was used to analyze and establish the 
prediction model, and the validation set was used to further verify the 
effectiveness of the model.
RESULT: Of the 1,787 patients included in the mimic database, a total of 379 
died during hospitalization. Recursive feature abstraction (RFE) selected 20 
variables. After simplification, we determined 10 features, including the 
Glasgow coma score (GCS), glucose, sodium, chloride, SPO2, bicarbonate, 
temperature, white blood cell (WBC), heparin use, and sepsis-related organ 
failure assessment (SOFA) score. The validation set and Delong test showed that 
the simplified RF model has a high AUC of 0.949, which is not significantly 
different from the best model. Furthermore, in the DCA curve, the simplified GBM 
model has relatively higher net benefits. In the subgroup analysis of 
non-traumatic subarachnoid hemorrhage, the simplified GBM model has a high AUC 
of 0.955 and relatively higher net benefits.
CONCLUSIONS: ML approaches significantly enhance predictive discrimination for 
mortality following subarachnoid hemorrhage compared to existing illness 
severity scores and LR. The discriminative ability of these ML models requires 
validation in external cohorts to establish generalizability.

BACKGROUND: Serum creatinine, an important diagnostic indicator for acute kidney 
injury (AKI), was considered to be a risk factor for cardiovascular disease. 
This study aimed to investigate the significance of postoperative serum 
creatinine in predicting the prognosis of cardiac surgery patients.
METHODS: The Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care III (MIMIC-III) 
database was used to extract the clinical data. Adult (≥18 years) cardiac 
surgery patients in the database were enrolled. The correlation of postoperative 
serum creatinine with lengths of intensive care unit (ICU) stay was analyzed 
with Spearman correlation, and the association of postoperative serum creatinine 
with hospital mortality was analyzed with chi-square tests. Multivariable 
logistic regression was used to identify postoperative serum creatinine as an 
independent prognostic factor for hospital mortality.
RESULTS: A total of 6,001 patients were enrolled in our study, among whom, 108 
patients (1.8%) died in the hospital. Non-survivors had much higher 
postoperative serum creatinine levels (initial: 0.8 vs. 1.2 mg/dl, P < 0.001; 
maximum: 1.1 vs. 2.8 mg/dl, P < 0.001; minimum: 0.8 vs.1.1 mg/dl, P < 0.001). 
Positive correlations were observed between postoperative serum creatinine (P < 
0.001) and lengths of ICU stay. For all models, postoperative initial 
creatinine, postoperative maximum creatinine, and postoperative minimum 
creatinine were all positively associated with hospital mortality (all P < 
0.001). The predictive performance of postoperative serum creatinine was 
moderately good (area under the curve (AUC) for initial creatinine = 0.7583; AUC 
for maximum creatinine = 0.8413; AUC for minimum creatinine = 0.7063).
CONCLUSIONS: This study demonstrated the potential to use postcardiac surgery 
serum creatinine as an outcome indicator.

INTRODUCTION AND OBJECTIVES: Cirrhotic patients with acute variceal hemorrhage 
(AVH) have high short-term mortality. Established prognostic scores are seldom 
applicable clinically, partially because they need external validation or 
contain subjective variables. We aimed to develop and validate a practical 
prognostic nomogram based on objective predictors to predict prognosis for 
cirrhotic patients with AVH.
PATIENTS AND METHODS: We enrolled 308 AVH patients with cirrhosis from our 
center as the derivation cohort to develop a new nomogram using logistic 
regression and validated it in cohorts of patients from Medical Information Mart 
for Intensive Care (MIMIC) III (n = 247) and IV (n = 302).
RESULTS: International normalized ratio (INR), albumin (ALB) and estimated 
glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) were identified as predictors for inpatient 
mortality and a nomogram was constructed based on them. The nomogram 
discriminated well in both derivation and MIMIC-III/-IV validation cohorts with 
the area under the receiver operating characteristic curves (AUROCs) of 0.846 
and 0.859/0.833, respectively and showed a better agreement between expected and 
observed outcomes (Hosmer-Lemeshow tests, all comparisons, P > 0.05) than other 
scores in all cohorts. Our nomogram had the lowest Brier scores 
(0.082/0.114/0.119 in training/MIMIC-III/MIMIC-IV) and highest R2 
(0.367/0.393/0.346 in training/MIMIC-III/MIMIC-IV) compared to the recalibrated 
model for end-stage liver disease (MELD), MELD-hepatic encephalopathy (MELD-HE) 
and cirrhosis acute gastrointestinal bleeding (CAGIB) scores in all cohorts.
CONCLUSIONS: We developed a practical prognostic nomogram using easily verified 
indicators available in initial patient evaluation, which may serve as a 
reliable tool to accurately predict inpatient mortality for cirrhotic patients 
with AVH.

Temporal-Spatial Correlation Attention Network for Clinical Data Analysis in 
Intensive Care Unit.

Nie W, Yu Y, Zhang C, Song D, Zhao L, Bai Y.

Recent advancements in medical information technology have enabled electronic 
health records (EHRs) to store comprehensive clinical data which has ushered 
healthcare into the era of "big data". However, medical data are rather 
complicated, making problem-solving in healthcare be limited in scope and 
comprehensiveness. The rapid development of deep learning in recent years has 
opened up opportunities for leveraging big data in healthcare. In this article 
we introduce a temporal-spatial correlation attention network (TSCAN) to address 
various clinical characteristic prediction problems, including mortality 
prediction, length of stay prediction, physiologic decline detection, and 
phenotype classification. Leveraging the attention mechanism model's design, our 
approach efficiently identifies relevant items in clinical data and temporally 
correlated nodes based on specific tasks, resulting in improved prediction 
accuracy. Additionally, our method identifies crucial clinical indicators 
associated with significant outcomes, which can inform and enhance treatment 
options. Our experiments utilize data from the publicly accessible Medical 
Information Mart for Intensive Care (MIMIC-IV) database. Finally, our approach 
demonstrates notable performance improvements of 2.0% (metric) compared to other 
SOTA prediction methods. Specifically, we achieved an impressive 90.7% mortality 
rate prediction accuracy and 45.1% accuracy in length of stay prediction.

OBJECTIVE: In this study, we investigated the association between comorbid sleep 
apnoea-hypopnoea syndrome (SAHS) and the prognosis of patients in an intensive 
care unit (ICU) to determine whether this relationship varies between different 
disease subgroups.
METHODS: We conducted a retrospective cohort study using publicly available 
information from the critical care database Medical Information Mart for 
Intensive Care III. Adults (≥18 years of age) who attended the ICU for the first 
time were enrolled. Demographic information and clinical data were obtained from 
each patient. The primary outcome was 30-day mortality after ICU admission, and 
the secondary outcomes were in-hospital and ICU mortality. Multivariate logistic 
regression and Cox regression analyses were used to examine the associations 
between SAHS comorbidities and the research outcomes. Propensity score matching 
was used to adjust for potential confounding variables.
RESULTS: Of the 32 989 patients enrolled, 1918 (5.81%) were diagnosed with SAHS 
as a comorbid condition. Patients with SAHS had a significantly lower 30-day 
mortality rate compared with those without SAHS (5.27% vs 13.65%, respectively; 
p<0.001). The frequency of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, cerebral 
disease, cardiovascular disease, hypertension, diabetes mellitus and renal 
failure was significantly different between the two groups. Patients with SAHS 
demonstrated significantly longer survival compared with patients without SAHS. 
Multivariate Cox proportional hazards regression identified a significant 
relationship between SAHS and mortality within 30 days (adjusted HR=0.610, 95% 
CI 0.499 to 0.747, p<0.0001).
CONCLUSION: SAHS as a comorbid condition decreases the risk of 30-day mortality, 
in-hospital mortality and ICU mortality among ICU patients.

Background: Thiamine deficiency is common in patients with heart failure, and 
thiamine supplement can benefit these patients. However, the association between 
thiamine administration and prognosis among critically ill patients with heart 
failure remains unclear. Thus, this study aims to prove the survival benefit of 
thiamine use in critically ill patients with heart failure. Methods: A 
retrospective cohort analysis was performed on the basis of the Medical 
Information Mart of Intensive Care-Ⅳ database. Critically ill patients with 
heart failure were divided into the thiamine and non-thiamine groups depending 
on whether they had received thiamine therapy or not during hospitalization. The 
association between thiamine supplement and in-hospital mortality was assessed 
by using the Kaplan-Meier (KM) method and Cox proportional hazard models. A 1:1 
nearest propensity-score matching (PSM) and propensity score-based inverse 
probability of treatment weighting (IPW) were also performed to ensure the 
robustness of the findings. Results: A total of 7,021 patients were included in 
this study, with 685 and 6,336 in the thiamine and non-thiamine groups, 
respectively. The kaplan-meier survival curves indicated that the thiamine group 
had a lower in-hospital mortality than the none-thiamine group. After adjusting 
for various confounders, the Cox regression models showed significant beneficial 
effects of thiamine administration on in-hospital mortality among critically ill 
patients with heart failure with a hazard ratio of 0.78 (95% confidence 
interval: 0.67-0.89) in the fully adjusted model. propensity-score matching and 
probability of treatment weighting analyses also achieved consistent results. 
Conclusion: Thiamine supplement is associated with a decreased risk of 
in-hospital mortality in critically ill patients with heart failure who are 
admitted to the ICU. Further multicenter and well-designed randomized controlled 
trials with large sample sizes are necessary to validate this finding.

BACKGROUND: Accurate and prompt clinical assessment of the severity and 
prognosis of patients with acute pancreatitis (AP) is critical, particularly 
during hospitalization. Natural language processing algorithms gain an 
opportunity from the growing number of free-text notes in electronic health 
records to mine this unstructured data, e.g., nursing notes, to detect and 
predict adverse outcomes. However, the predictive value of nursing notes for AP 
prognosis is unclear. In this study, a predictive model for in-hospital 
mortality in AP was developed using measured sentiment scores in nursing notes.
METHODS: The data of AP patients in the retrospective cohort study were 
collected from the Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care III (MIMIC-III) 
database. Sentiments in nursing notes were assessed by sentiment analysis. For 
each individual clinical note, sentiment polarity and sentiment subjectivity 
scores were assigned. The in-hospital mortality of AP patients was the outcome. 
A predictive model was built based on clinical information and sentiment scores, 
and its performance and clinical value were evaluated using the area under 
curves (AUCs) and decision-making curves, respectively.
RESULTS: Of the 631 AP patients included, 88 cases (13.9%) cases were dead in 
hospital. When various confounding factors were adjusted, the mean sentiment 
polarity was associated with a reduced risk of in-hospital mortality in AP [odds 
ratio (OR): 0.448; 95% confidence interval (CI): 0.233-0.833; P=0.014]. A 
predictive model was established in the training group via multivariate logistic 
regression analysis, including 12 independent variables. In the testing group, 
the model showed an AUC of 0.812, which was significantly greater than the 
sequential organ failure assessment (SOFA) of 0.732 and the simplified acute 
physiology score-II (SAPS-II) of 0.792 (P<0.05). When the same level of risk was 
considered, the clinical benefits of the predictive model were found to be the 
highest compared with SOFA and SAPS-II scores.
CONCLUSIONS: The model combined sentiment scores in nursing notes showed well 
predictive performance and clinical value in in-hospital mortality of AP 
patients.

BACKGROUND: Patient monitoring is vital in all stages of care. In particular, 
intensive care unit (ICU) patient monitoring has the potential to reduce 
complications and morbidity, and to increase the quality of care by enabling 
hospitals to deliver higher-quality, cost-effective patient care, and improve 
the quality of medical services in the ICU.
OBJECTIVE: We here report the development and validation of ICU length of stay 
and mortality prediction models. The models will be used in an intelligent ICU 
patient monitoring module of an Intelligent Remote Patient Monitoring (IRPM) 
framework that monitors the health status of patients, and generates timely 
alerts, maneuver guidance, or reports when adverse medical conditions are 
predicted.
METHODS: We utilized the publicly available Medical Information Mart for 
Intensive Care (MIMIC) database to extract ICU stay data for adult patients to 
build two prediction models: one for mortality prediction and another for ICU 
length of stay. For the mortality model, we applied six commonly used machine 
learning (ML) binary classification algorithms for predicting the discharge 
status (survived or not). For the length of stay model, we applied the same six 
ML algorithms for binary classification using the median patient population ICU 
stay of 2.64 days. For the regression-based classification, we used two ML 
algorithms for predicting the number of days. We built two variations of each 
prediction model: one using 12 baseline demographic and vital sign features, and 
the other based on our proposed quantiles approach, in which we use 21 extra 
features engineered from the baseline vital sign features, including their 
modified means, standard deviations, and quantile percentages.
RESULTS: We could perform predictive modeling with minimal features while 
maintaining reasonable performance using the quantiles approach. The best 
accuracy achieved in the mortality model was approximately 89% using the random 
forest algorithm. The highest accuracy achieved in the length of stay model, 
based on the population median ICU stay (2.64 days), was approximately 65% using 
the random forest algorithm.
CONCLUSIONS: The novelty in our approach is that we built models to predict ICU 
length of stay and mortality with reasonable accuracy based on a combination of 
ML and the quantiles approach that utilizes only vital signs available from the 
patient's profile without the need to use any external features. This approach 
is based on feature engineering of the vital signs by including their modified 
means, standard deviations, and quantile percentages of the original features, 
which provided a richer dataset to achieve better predictive power in our 
models.

OBJECTIVES: The application of natural language processing (NLP) in the clinical 
domain is important due to the rich unstructured information in clinical 
documents, which often remains inaccessible in structured data. When applying 
NLP methods to a certain domain, the role of benchmark datasets is crucial as 
benchmark datasets not only guide the selection of best-performing models but 
also enable the assessment of the reliability of the generated outputs. Despite 
the recent availability of language models capable of longer context, benchmark 
datasets targeting long clinical document classification tasks are absent.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: To address this issue, we propose Long Clinical Document 
(LCD) benchmark, a benchmark for the task of predicting 30-day out-of-hospital 
mortality using discharge notes of Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care 
IV and statewide death data. We evaluated this benchmark dataset using baseline 
models, from bag-of-words and convolutional neural network to instruction-tuned 
large language models. Additionally, we provide a comprehensive analysis of the 
model outputs, including manual review and visualization of model weights, to 
offer insights into their predictive capabilities and limitations.
RESULTS: Baseline models showed 28.9% for best-performing supervised models and 
32.2% for GPT-4 in F1 metrics. Notes in our dataset have a median word count of 
1687.
DISCUSSION: Our analysis of the model outputs showed that our dataset is 
challenging for both models and human experts, but the models can find 
meaningful signals from the text.
CONCLUSION: We expect our LCD benchmark to be a resource for the development of 
advanced supervised models, or prompting methods, tailored for clinical text.

BACKGROUND: This study aimed to evaluate the association between the 
glucose-to-lymphocyte ratio (GLR) and in-hospital mortality in intensive care 
unit (ICUs) patients with sepsis.
METHODS: This is a retrospective cohort study. Patients with sepsis from the 
Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care-IV (MIMIC-IV) database had their 
baseline data and in-hospital prognosis retrieved. Multivariable Cox regression 
analyses were applied to calculate adjusted hazard ratios (HR) with 95% 
confidence intervals (CI). Survival curves were plotted, and subgroup analyses 
were stratified by relevant covariates. To address the non-linearity 
relationship, curve fitting and a threshold effect analysis were performed.
RESULTS: Of the 23,901 patients, 10,118 patients with sepsis were included. The 
overall in-hospital mortality rate was 17.1% (1,726/10,118). Adjusted for 
confounding factors in the multivariable Cox regression analysis models, when 
GLR was used as a categorical variable, patients in the highest GLR quartile had 
increased in-hospital mortality compared to patients in the lowest GLR quartile 
(HR = 1.26, 95% CI: 1.15-1.38). When GLR was used as a continuous variable, each 
unit increase in GLR was associated with a 2% increase in the prevalence of 
in-hospital mortality (adjusted HR = 1.02, 95% CI: 1.01-1.03, p = 0.001). 
Stratified analyses indicated that the correlation between the GLR and 
in-hospital mortality was stable. The non-linear relationship between GLR and 
in-hospital mortality was explored in a dose-dependent manner. In-hospital 
mortality increased by 67% (aHR = 1.67, 95% CI: 1.45-1.92) for every unit GLR 
increase. When GLR was beyond 1.68, in-hospital mortality did not significantly 
change (aHR: 1.04, 95% CI: 0.92-1.18).
CONCLUSION: There is a non-linear relationship between GLR and in-hospital 
mortality in intensive care patients with sepsis. A higher GLR in ICU patients 
is associated with in-hospital mortality in the United States. However, further 
research is needed to confirm the findings.

BACKGROUND: Skull fracture can lead to significant morbidity and mortality, yet 
the development of effective predictive tools has remained a challenge. This 
study aimed to establish and validate a nomogram to evaluate the 28-day 
mortality risk among patients with skull fracture.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: Data extracted from the Medical Information Mart for 
Intensive Care (MIMIC) database were utilized as the training set, while data 
from the eICU Collaborative Research Database were employed as the external 
validation set. This nomogram was developed using univariate Cox regression, 
best subset regression (BSR), and the least absolute shrinkage and selection 
operator (LASSO) methods. Subsequently, backward stepwise multivariable Cox 
regression was employed to refine predictor selection. Variance inflation factor 
(VIF), akaike information criterion (AIC), area under the receiver operating 
characteristic curve (AUC), concordance index (C-index), calibration curve, and 
decision curve analysis (DCA) were used to assess the model's performance.
RESULTS: A total of 1,527 adult patients with skull fracture were enrolled for 
this analysis. The predictive factors in the final nomogram included age, 
temperature, serum sodium, mechanical ventilation, vasoactive agent, mannitol, 
extradural hematoma, loss of consciousness and Glasgow Coma Scale score. The AUC 
of our nomogram was 0.857, and C-index value was 0.832. After external 
validation, the model maintained an AUC of 0.853 and a C-index of 0.829. 
Furthermore, it showed good calibration with a low Brier score of 0.091 in the 
training set and 0.093 in the external validation set. DCA in both sets revealed 
that our model was clinically useful.
CONCLUSION: A nomogram incorporating nine features was constructed, with a good 
ability in predicting 28-day mortality in patients with skull fracture.

Multi-gate Mixture of Multi-view Graph Contrastive Learning on Electronic Health 
Record.

Cao Y, Wang Q, Wang X, Peng D, Li P.

Electronic Health Record (EHR) is the digital form of patient visits containing 
various medical data, including diagnosis, treatment, and lab events. 
Representation learning of EHR with deep learning methods has been beneficial 
for patient-related prediction tasks. Recently, studies have focused on 
revealing the inherent graph structure between medical events in EHR. Graph 
neural network (GNN) methods are prevalent and perform well in various 
prediction tasks. However, the inherent relationships between various medical 
events must be marked, which is complicated and time-consuming. Most research 
works adopt the straightforward structure of GNN models on a single prediction 
task which could not fully exploit the potential of EHR representations. 
Compared with previous work, the multi-task prediction could utilize the latent 
information of concealed correlations between different prediction tasks. In 
addition, self-contrastive learning on graphs could improve the representation 
learned by GNN. We propose a multi-gate mixture of multi-view graph contrastive 
learning (MMMGCL) method, aiming to get a more reasonable EHR representation and 
improve the performances of downstream tasks. First, each patient visit is 
represented as a graph with a well-designed hierarchically fully-connected 
pattern. Second, node features in the manually constructed graph are pre-trained 
via the Glove method with hierarchical ontology knowledge. Finally, MMMGCL 
processes the pre-trained graph and adopts a joint learning strategy to 
simultaneously optimize task and contrastive losses. We verify our method on two 
large open-source medical datasets, Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care 
(MIMIC-III) and the eICU Collaborative Research Database (eICU). Experiment 
results show that our method could improve performance compared to 
straightforward graph-based methods on prediction tasks of patient readmission, 
mortality, and length of stay.

Traditional scoring systems, such as APACHE II, SOFA, and SAPS II, predict ICU 
mortality using logistic regression (LR) models based on the worst values of 
time-series variables. This methodology often disregards temporal dynamics, 
limiting predictive accuracy. This study aimed to enhance mortality prediction 
in ICU patients by utilizing Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) algorithms, which 
capture the full temporal information from time-series data collected within the 
first 24 h of ICU admission. A total of 1336 ICU patients from the Medical 
Information Mart for Intensive Care-IV database were included in this study. 
Time-series variables from the APACHE II, SOFA, and SAPS II scoring systems 
during the initial 24 h of each patient were collected retrospectively to 
develop LSTM-based prediction models for hospital mortality. Three distinct data 
representations were employed for each scoring system: (1) original hourly data 
over the 24-h period, (2) categorized hourly data derived from the cutoff points 
defined in the scoring systems, and (3) total scores calculated on an hourly 
basis. These data representations were used as inputs for separate LSTM models. 
Model performance was evaluated using a range of metrics, including the area 
under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC), sensitivity, 
specificity, F1 score, and Brier score. The LSTM-optimized models significantly 
outperformed LR model using conventional scoring systems. For APACHE II, the 
LSTM model achieved an AUC of 0.898 compared to 0.777 for LR (P < 0.001). 
Similarly, the SOFA and SAPS II LSTM models achieved AUCs of 0.861 and 0.897, 
respectively, compared to 0.715 (P < 0.001) and 0.708 (P = 0.004) for their LR 
counterparts. While all three LSTM models performed well, the model utilizing 
original hourly values consistently demonstrated the highest accuracy, 
particularly for APACHE II (P = 0.021). Incorporating time-series data into 
LSTM-based prediction models significantly improves the accuracy of ICU 
mortality prediction compared to traditional LR-based scoring systems. This 
approach has the potential to redefine clinical decision support tools in 
critical care settings by leveraging temporal dynamics in patient data.

BACKGROUND: Clinical notes contain contextualized information beyond structured 
data related to patients' past and current health status.
OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to design a multimodal deep learning approach to 
improve the evaluation precision of hospital outcomes for heart failure (HF) 
using admission clinical notes and easily collected tabular data.
METHODS: Data for the development and validation of the multimodal model were 
retrospectively derived from 3 open-access US databases, including the Medical 
Information Mart for Intensive Care III v1.4 (MIMIC-III) and MIMIC-IV v1.0, 
collected from a teaching hospital from 2001 to 2019, and the eICU Collaborative 
Research Database v1.2, collected from 208 hospitals from 2014 to 2015. The 
study cohorts consisted of all patients with critical HF. The clinical notes, 
including chief complaint, history of present illness, physical examination, 
medical history, and admission medication, as well as clinical variables 
recorded in electronic health records, were analyzed. We developed a deep 
learning mortality prediction model for in-hospital patients, which underwent 
complete internal, prospective, and external evaluation. The Integrated 
Gradients and SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) methods were used to analyze 
the importance of risk factors.
RESULTS: The study included 9989 (16.4%) patients in the development set, 2497 
(14.1%) patients in the internal validation set, 1896 (18.3%) in the prospective 
validation set, and 7432 (15%) patients in the external validation set. The area 
under the receiver operating characteristic curve of the models was 0.838 (95% 
CI 0.827-0.851), 0.849 (95% CI 0.841-0.856), and 0.767 (95% CI 0.762-0.772), for 
the internal, prospective, and external validation sets, respectively. The area 
under the receiver operating characteristic curve of the multimodal model 
outperformed that of the unimodal models in all test sets, and tabular data 
contributed to higher discrimination. The medical history and physical 
examination were more useful than other factors in early assessments.
CONCLUSIONS: The multimodal deep learning model for combining admission notes 
and clinical tabular data showed promising efficacy as a potentially novel 
method in evaluating the risk of mortality in patients with HF, providing more 
accurate and timely decision support.

OBJECTIVE: Hip fracture is a prevalent condition with a significant death rate 
among the elderly. We sought to develop a nomogram-based survival prediction 
model for older patients with hip fracture.
DESIGN: A retrospective case-control study.
SETTING: The data from Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care III 
(MIMIC-III V.1.4).
PARTICIPANTS: The clinical features of elderly patients with hip fracture, 
including basic information, comorbidities, severity score, laboratory tests and 
therapy, were filtered out based on the MIMIC-III V.1.4.
METHODS AND MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: All patients included in the study were from 
critical care and randomly divided into training and validation sets (7:3). On 
the basis of retrieved data, the least absolute shrinkage and selection operator 
(LASSO) regression and multiple logistic regression analysis were used to 
identify independent predictive variables of 1-year mortality, and then 
constructed a risk prediction nomogram. The predictive values of the nomogram 
model were evaluated by the concordance indexes (C-indexes), receiver operating 
characteristic curve, decision curve analysis (DCA) and calibration curve.
RESULTS: A total of 341 elderly patients with hip fracture were included in this 
study; 121 cases died within 1 year. After LASSO regression and multiple 
logistic regression analysis, a novel nomogram contained the predictive 
variables of age, weight, the proportion of lymphocyte count, liver disease, 
malignant tumour and congestive heart failure. The constructed model proved 
satisfactory discrimination with C-indexes of 0.738 (95% CI 0.674 to 0.802) in 
the training set and 0.713 (95% CI 0.608 to 0.819) in the validation set. The 
calibration curve shows a good degree of fitting between the predicted and 
observed probabilities and the DCA confirms the model's clinical practicability.
CONCLUSIONS: The novel prediction model provides personalised predictions for 
1-year mortality in elderly patients with hip fractures. Compared with other hip 
fracture models, our nomogram is particularly suitable for predicting long-term 
mortality in critical patients.

BACKGROUND: The association between red blood cell distribution width (RDW) to 
albumin ratio (RAR) and prognosis in patients with acute respiratory failure 
(ARF) admitted to the Intensive Care Unit (ICU) remains unclear. This 
retrospective cohort study aims to investigate this association.
METHODS: Clinical information of ARF patients was collected from the Medical 
Information Mart for Intensive Care IV (MIMIC-IV) version 2.0 database. The 
primary outcome was, in-hospital mortality and secondary outcomes included 
28-day mortality, 60-day mortality, length of hospital stay, and length of ICU 
stay. Cox regression models and subgroup analyses were conducted to explore the 
relationship between RAR and mortality.
RESULTS: A total of 4547 patients with acute respiratory failure were enrolled, 
with 2277 in the low ratio group (RAR < 4.83) and 2270 in the high ratio group 
(RAR > = 4.83). Kaplan-Meier survival analysis demonstrated a significant 
difference in survival probability between the two groups. After adjusting for 
confounding factors, the Cox regression analysis showed that the high RAR ratio 
had a higher hazard ratio (HR) for in-hospital mortality (HR 1.22, 95% CI 
1.07-1.40; P = 0.003), as well as for 28-day mortality and 60-day mortality. 
Propensity score-matched (PSM) analysis further supported the finding that high 
RAR was an independent risk factor for ARF.
CONCLUSION: This study reveals that RAR is an independent risk factor for poor 
clinical prognosis in patients with ARF admitted to the ICU. Higher RAR levels 
were associated with increased in-hospital, 28-day and 60-day mortality rates.

OBJECTIVE: The effectiveness of antithrombotic drugs for treating sepsis is 
controversial. Here, we explore the association between antithrombotic therapy 
and intensive care unit (ICU) mortality for septic patients with peripheral 
vascular disease.
METHODS: This retrospective cohort study uses data from the Medical Information 
Mart for Intensive Care (MIMIC)-III database. Kaplan-Meier survival analyses 
were used to examine mortality among different groups. Cox regression and 
marginal structural Cox models (MSCMs) were used to adjust for confounding 
factors. Main Results. The final cohort from the MIMIC-III database included 776 
patients, of which 701 survived and 75 perished. The anticoagulant (AC) group 
and the antiplatelet-anticoagulation (AC-AP) group survived better than the 
group without antithrombotic treatment (non-AT). The AC and AC-AP groups showed 
a 0.363-fold and 0.373-fold risk of ICU mortality, respectively, compared with 
the non-AT group when controlling for age, gender, CRRT, alcohol, heart failure, 
hypertension, diabetes, obesity, renal failure, liver disease, INR, PT, PPT, and 
SpO2. Antiplatelet therapy did not reduce ICU mortality. The same trends were 
apparent from the MSCM. In addition, the AC-AP group exhibited a lower risk of 
bleeding complications.
CONCLUSION: Although the antithrombotic group (AC and AC-AP groups) demonstrated 
a higher sequential organ failure assessment (SOFA) score than the group without 
antithrombotic treatment (non-AT group), the risk of ICU mortality was lower 
without increasing the risk of bleeding complications. Our study further 
suggested that anticoagulation therapy may benefit the prognosis of septic 
patients with peripheral vascular disease.

BACKGROUND: Heart failure (HF) patients in intensive care units (ICUs) are 
rather poorly studied based on varying left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) 
classification. Characteristics and prognosis of patients in ICUs with HF with 
mildly reduced ejection fraction (HFmrEF), HF with reduced ejection fraction 
(HFrEF) and HF with preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF) require further 
clarification.
METHODS: Data involving clinical information and 4-year follow-up records of HF 
patients were extracted and integrated from the Medical Information Mart for 
Intensive Care III (MIMIC-III) database. Tests were carried out to identity 
differences among these three HF subtypes. Prognostic analyses were performed 
using Kaplan-Meier survival analysis and Cox proportional-hazards regression 
modeling. To develop a novel prediction nomogram, forward selection was used as 
the best-fit model. Prognostic heterogeneity of the subgroups prespecified by 
stratification factors in pairwise comparisons was presented using forest plots.
RESULTS: A total of 4150 patients were enrolled in this study. HFmrEF had the 
lowest all-cause mortality rate during the 4-year follow-up, which was 
significantly different from HFrEF and HFpEF (Log-Rank p  <  0.001). The Cox 
proportional-hazards regression model also showed that a comparison of HFrEF 
versus HFmrEF indicated a hazard ratio (HR) of 0.76 (95% CI 0.61-0.94, p = 
0.011) and HFrEF versus HFpEF indicated a HR 0.93 (95% CI 0.82-1.07, p = 0.307). 
Following a multivariable analysis, 13 factors were confirmed as independent. A 
new nomogram was established and quantified with a concordance index (C-index) 
of 0.70 (95% CI 0.67-0.73), and the internal validation indicated the accuracy 
of the model. Stratification factors such as a history of coronary artery bypass 
grafting (CABG) and comorbidity of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) 
induced prognostic heterogeneity among the three subtypes.
CONCLUSIONS: Clinical characteristics and prognosis significantly varied among 
the three subtypes of HF patients in ICUs, with HFmrEF patients achieving the 
best prognosis. The novel prediction model, tailored for this population, showed 
a satisfying prediction ability.

The purpose of this study was to investigate the value of the Charlson 
comorbidity index (CCI) in predicting intensive care unit (ICU) readmission in 
aortic aneurysm (AA) patients. Patient information came from the Medical 
Information Mart for Intensive Care- IV (MIMIC-IV) database. The relationship 
between CCI and ICU readmission was analyzed by restricted cubic spline, 
generalized linear regression, trend analysis, and hierarchical analysis. The 
clinical value of CCI in predicting ICU readmission was analyzed by receiver 
operating characteristic curve, decision curve analysis, XGBoost regression, and 
random forest regression. A total of 523 patients with AA were enrolled in the 
study. Patients with AA who were readmitted to the ICU had higher width of red 
blood cell distribution width (RDW) and higher CCI. CCI had better performance 
and clinical net benefit for predicting ICU readmission than RDW. An independent 
nonlinear relationship was found between CCI and ICU readmission. The trend 
analysis suggested that the risk of ICU readmission increased with higher CCI 
scores. The hierarchical analysis showed that their association was mainly found 
in surgery requirement populations regardless of AA types. Further, CCI was 
found to have better clinical value in predicting ICU readmission of thoracic 
aortic aneurysm (TAA) patients undergoing surgery. Age, renal disease, chronic 
lung disease, and dementia were important components of CCI in predicting ICU 
readmission of TAA patients undergoing surgery. CCI was independently associated 
with the ICU readmission of AA patients in a positive relationship and had more 
favorable prediction performance in TAA patients who underwent surgery.

INTRODUCTION: The present study presents the development and validation of a 
clinical prediction model using random survival forest (RSF) and stepwise Cox 
regression, aiming to predict the probability of pelvic inflammatory disease 
(PID) progressing to sepsis.
METHODS: A retrospective cohort study was conducted, gathering clinical data of 
patients diagnosed with PID between 2008 and 2019 from the Medical Information 
Mart for Intensive Care (MIMIC)-IV database. Patients who met the Sepsis 3.0 
diagnostic criteria were selected, with sepsis as the outcome. Univariate Cox 
regression and stepwise Cox regression were used to screen variables for 
constructing a nomogram. Moreover, an RSF model was created using machine 
learning algorithms. To verify the model's performance, a calibration curve, 
decision curve analysis (DCA), and receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve 
were utilized. Furthermore, the capabilities of the two models for estimating 
the incidence of sepsis in PID patients within 3 and 7 days were compared.
RESULTS: A total of 1064 PID patients were included, of whom 54 had progressed 
to sepsis. The established nomogram highlighted dialysis, reduced platelet (PLT) 
counts, history of pneumonia, medication of glucocorticoids, and increased 
leukocyte counts as significant predictive factors. The areas under the curve 
(AUCs) of the nomogram for prediction of PID progression to sepsis at 3-day and 
7-day (3-/7-day) in the training set and the validation set were 0.886/0.863 and 
0.824/0.726, respectively, and the C-index of the model was 0.8905. The RSF 
displayed excellent performance, with AUCs of 0.939/0.919 and 0.712/0.571 for 
3-/7-day risk prediction in the training set and validation set, respectively.
CONCLUSION: The nomogram accurately predicted the incidence of sepsis in PID 
patients, and relevant risk factors were identified. While the RSF model 
outperformed the Cox regression models in predicting sepsis incidence, its 
performance exhibited some instability. On the other hand, the Cox 
regression-based nomogram displayed stable performance and improved 
interpretability, thereby supporting clinical decision-making in PID treatment.

Previous studies have shown that mean corpuscular volume (MCV) levels are 
associated with the prognosis of patients with cardiovascular disease. However, 
the relationship between MCV levels and mortality in patients with intracerebral 
hemorrhage (ICH) remains unclear. Patients with ICH were extracted from the 
Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care-III database. The primary outcome 
measure was 30-day mortality. Multivariate Cox regression analysis was used to 
investigate the relationship between MCV at admission and 30-day mortality in 
ICH patients. We enrolled 1100 patients with ICH. After adjustment for potential 
confounders, we found that a 1 unit increase in MCV (fl) was associated with a 
3% increase in 30-day mortality (HR = 1.03, 95% CI = 1.01-1.05, P = .0015). High 
MCV (MCV ≥ 92 fl) compared with the low MCV group (MCV < 87 fl) showed a 46% 
increase of 30-day mortality (HR = 1.46, 95% CI = 1.10-1.92 P = .008). In 
subgroups analysis's the results remained stable. We demonstrated that MCV at 
admission was positively associated with 30-day mortality. The Kaplan-Meier (KM) 
method was used to plot survival curves of three groups with different admission 
MCV levels.

BACKGROUND: Septic shock is a lethal disease, and identifying high-risk patients 
through noninvasive and widely available biomarkers can help improve global 
outcomes. While the clinical impact of chloride levels on critically ill 
patients remains unclear, this study aims to investigate the association between 
hypochloremia and mortality following ICU admission among septic shock patients.
METHODS: This is an analysis of data stored in the databases of Medical 
Information Mart for Intensive Care IV (MIMIC-IV). The initial chloride levels 
were classified ashypochloremia, normal chloraemia, and hyperchloraemia. A 
multivariate logistic regression model was applied, adjusting for age, lactate, 
pH, PO2, urine volume, RDW, creatinine, and liver disease, to assess the 
association between the three categories of chloride levels and mortality.
RESULTS: Of 3726 patients included in the study, 470 patients (12.6%) had 
hypochloremia on ICU admission. During the follow-up period, 1120 (33.5%) 
patients died. Hypochloremia was significantly associated with increased 
mortality and the incidence of AKI after adjusting for several variables.
CONCLUSIONS: Hypochloremia is independently associated with higher hospital 
mortality, AKI incidence among septic shock patients. However, further 
high-quality research is necessary to establish the precise relationship between 
hypochloremia and septic shock prognosis.

BACKGROUND: The Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (SOFA) score monitors organ 
failure and defines sepsis but may not fully capture factors influencing sepsis 
mortality. Socioeconomic and demographic impacts on sepsis outcomes have been 
highlighted recently.
OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the prognostic value of SOFA scores against demographic 
and social health determinants for predicting sepsis mortality in critically ill 
patients, and to assess if a combined model increases predictive accuracy.
METHODS: The study utilized retrospective data from the MIMIC-IV database and 
prospective external validation from the Penn State Health cohort. A Random 
Forest model incorporating SOFA scores, demographic/social data, and the 
Charlson Comorbidity Index was trained and validated.
FINDINGS: In the MIMIC-IV dataset of 32,970 sepsis patients, 6,824 (20.7%) died 
within 30 days. A model including demographic, socioeconomic, and comorbidity 
data with SOFA scores improved predictive accuracy beyond SOFA scores alone. Day 
2 SOFA, age, weight, and comorbidities were significant predictors. External 
validation showed consistent performance, highlighting the importance of delta 
SOFA between days 1 and 3.
CONCLUSION: Adding patient-specific demographic and socioeconomic information to 
clinical metrics significantly improves sepsis mortality prediction. This 
suggests a more comprehensive, multidimensional prognostic approach is needed 
for accurate sepsis outcome predictions.

BACKGROUND: Early and accurate evaluation of severity and prognosis in acute 
pancreatitis (AP), especially at the time of admission is very significant. This 
study was aimed to develop an artificial neural networks (ANN) model for early 
prediction of in-hospital mortality in AP.
METHODS: Patients with AP were identified from the Medical Information Mart for 
Intensive Care-III (MIMIC-III) database. Clinical and laboratory data were 
utilized to perform a predictive model by back propagation ANN approach.
RESULTS: A total of 337 patients with AP were analyzed in the study, and the 
in-hospital mortality rate was 11.2%. A total of 12 variables that differed 
between patients in survivor group and nonsurvivor group were applied to 
construct ANN model. Three independent variables were identified as risk factors 
associated with in-hospital mortality by multivariate logistic regression 
analysis. The predictive performance based on the area under the receiver 
operating characteristic curve (AUC) was 0.769 for ANN model, 0.607 for logistic 
regression, 0.652 for Ranson score, and 0.401 for SOFA score.
CONCLUSION: An ANN predictive model for in-hospital mortality in patients with 
AP in MIMIC-III database was first performed. The patients with high risk of 
fatal outcome can be screened out easily in the early stage of AP by our model.

BACKGROUND: Acute kidney injury (AKI) is a prevalent and severe complication of 
sepsis contributing to high morbidity and mortality among critically ill 
patients. In this retrospective study, we develop a novel risk-predicted 
nomogram of sepsis associated-AKI (SA-AKI).
METHODS: A total of 2,871 patients from the Medical Information Mart for 
Intensive Care III (MIMIC-III) critical care database were randomly assigned to 
primary (2,012 patients) and validation (859 patients) cohorts. A risk-predicted 
nomogram for SA-AKI was developed through multivariate logistic regression 
analysis in the primary cohort while the nomogram was evaluated in the 
validation cohort. Nomogram discrimination and calibration were assessed using 
C-index and calibration curves in the primary and external validation cohorts. 
The clinical utility of the final nomogram was evaluated using decision curve 
analysis.
RESULTS: Risk predictors included in the prediction nomogram included length of 
stay in intensive care unit (LOS in ICU), baseline serum creatinine (SCr), 
glucose, anemia, and vasoactive drugs. Nomogram revealed moderate discrimination 
and calibration in estimating the risk of SA-AKI, with an unadjusted C-index of 
0.752, 95 %Cl (0.730-0.774), and a bootstrap-corrected C index of 0.749. 
Application of the nomogram in the validation cohort provided moderate 
discrimination (C-index, 0.757 [95 % CI, 0.724-0.790]) and good calibration. 
Besides, the decision curve analysis (DCA) confirmed the clinical usefulness of 
the nomogram.
CONCLUSIONS: This study developed and validated an AKI risk prediction nomogram 
applied to critically ill patients with sepsis, which may help identify 
reasonable risk judgments and treatment strategies to a certain extent. 
Nevertheless, further verification using external data is essential to enhance 
its applicability in clinical practice.

OBJECTIVES: Given the high incidence and mortality rate of sepsis, early 
identification of high-risk patients and timely intervention are crucial. 
However, existing mortality risk prediction models still have shortcomings in 
terms of operation, applicability, and evaluation on long-term prognosis. This 
study aims to investigate the risk factors for death in patients with sepsis, 
and to construct the prediction model of short-term and long-term mortality 
risk.
METHODS: Patients meeting sepsis 3.0 diagnostic criteria were selected from the 
Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care-IV (MIMIC-IV) database and randomly 
divided into a modeling group and a validation group at a ratio of 7꞉3. Baseline 
data of patients were analyzed. Univariate Cox regression analysis and full 
subset regression were used to determine the risk factors of death in patients 
with sepsis and to screen out the variables to construct the prediction model. 
The time-dependent area under the curve (AUC), calibration curve, and decision 
curve were used to evaluate the differentiation, calibration, and clinical 
practicability of the model.
RESULTS: A total of 14 240 patients with sepsis were included in our study. The 
28-day and 1-year mortality were 21.45% (3 054 cases) and 36.50% (5 198 cases), 
respectively. Advanced age, female, high sepsis-related organ failure assessment 
(SOFA) score, high simplified acute physiology score II (SAPS II), rapid heart 
rate, rapid respiratory rate, septic shock, congestive heart failure, chronic 
obstructive pulmonary disease, liver disease, kidney disease, diabetes, 
malignant tumor, high white blood cell count (WBC), long prothrombin time (PT), 
and high serum creatinine (SCr) levels were all risk factors for sepsis death 
(all P<0.05). Eight variables, including PT, respiratory rate, body temperature, 
malignant tumor, liver disease, septic shock, SAPS II, and age were used to 
construct the model. The AUCs for 28-day and 1-year survival were 0.717 (95% CI 
0.710 to 0.724) and 0.716 (95% CI 0.707 to 0.725), respectively. The calibration 
curve and decision curve showed that the model had good calibration degree and 
clinical application value.
CONCLUSIONS: The short-term and long-term mortality risk prediction models of 
patients with sepsis based on the MIMIC-IV database have good recognition 
ability and certain clinical reference significance for prognostic risk 
assessment and intervention treatment of patients.

OBJECTIVE: Given the high incidence and mortality rate of sepsis, early 
identification of high-risk patients and timely intervention are crucial. 
However, existing mortality risk prediction models still have shortcomings in 
terms of operation, applicability, and evaluation on long-term prognosis. This 
study aims to investigate the risk factors for death in patients with sepsis, 
and to construct the prediction model of short-term and long-term mortality 
risk.
METHODS: Patients meeting sepsis 3.0 diagnostic criteria were selected from the 
Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care-IV (MIMIC-IV) database and randomly 
divided into a modeling group and a validation group at a ratio of 7꞉3. Baseline 
data of patients were analyzed. Univariate Cox regression analysis and full 
subset regression were used to determine the risk factors of death in patients 
with sepsis and to screen out the variables to construct the prediction model. 
The time-dependent area under the curve (AUC), calibration curve, and decision 
curve were used to evaluate the differentiation, calibration, and clinical 
practicability of the model.
RESULTS: A total of 14 240 patients with sepsis were included in our study. The 
28-day and 1-year mortality were 21.45% (3 054 cases) and 36.50% (5 198 cases), 
respectively. Advanced age, female, high sepsis-related organ failure assessment 
(SOFA) score, high simplified acute physiology score II (SAPS II), rapid heart 
rate, rapid respiratory rate, septic shock, congestive heart failure, chronic 
obstructive pulmonary disease, liver disease, kidney disease, diabetes, 
malignant tumor, high white blood cell count (WBC), long prothrombin time (PT), 
and high serum creatinine (SCr) levels were all risk factors for sepsis death 
(all P<0.05). Eight variables, including PT, respiratory rate, body temperature, 
malignant tumor, liver disease, septic shock, SAPS II, and age were used to 
construct the model. The AUCs for 28-day and 1-year survival were 0.717 (95% CI 
0.710 to 0.724) and 0.716 (95% CI 0.707 to 0.725), respectively. The calibration 
curve and decision curve showed that the model had good calibration degree and 
clinical application value.
CONCLUSION: The short-term and long-term mortality risk prediction models of 
patients with sepsis based on the MIMIC-IV database have good recognition 
ability and certain clinical reference significance for prognostic risk 
assessment and intervention treatment of patients.

Background: The number of geriatric traumatic brain injury (TBI) patients is 
increasing every year due to the population’s aging in most of the developed 
countries. Unfortunately, there is no widely recognized tool for specifically 
evaluating the prognosis of geriatric TBI patients. We designed this study to 
compare the prognostic value of different machine learning algorithm-based 
predictive models for geriatric TBI. Methods: TBI patients aged ≥65 from the 
Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care-III (MIMIC-III) database were 
eligible for this study. To develop and validate machine learning 
algorithm-based prognostic models, included patients were divided into a 
training set and a testing set, with a ratio of 7:3. The predictive value of 
different machine learning based models was evaluated by calculating the area 
under the receiver operating characteristic curve, sensitivity, specificity, 
accuracy and F score. Results: A total of 1123 geriatric TBI patients were 
included, with a mortality of 24.8%. Non-survivors had higher age (82.2 vs. 
80.7, p = 0.010) and lower Glasgow Coma Scale (14 vs. 7, p < 0.001) than 
survivors. The rate of mechanical ventilation was significantly higher (67.6% 
vs. 25.9%, p < 0.001) in non-survivors while the rate of neurosurgical operation 
did not differ between survivors and non-survivors (24.3% vs. 23.0%, p = 0.735). 
Among different machine learning algorithms, Adaboost (AUC: 0.799) and Random 
Forest (AUC: 0.795) performed slightly better than the logistic regression (AUC: 
0.792) on predicting mortality in geriatric TBI patients in the testing set. 
Conclusion: Adaboost, Random Forest and logistic regression all performed well 
in predicting mortality of geriatric TBI patients. Prognostication tools 
utilizing these algorithms are helpful for physicians to evaluate the risk of 
poor outcomes in geriatric TBI patients and adopt personalized therapeutic 
options for them.

OBJECTIVES: Our previous study shows that serum ammonia in sepsis patients 
without hepatic failure is associated with a poor prognosis. The relationship 
between serum ammonia level and the prognosis of sepsis-associated 
encephalopathy (SAE) patients without hepatic failure remains unclear. We aimed 
to explore the relationship between serum ammonia levels and the prognosis of 
patients with SAE.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: This study is a retrospective cohort study. We collected 
465 patients with SAE admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) from Medical 
Information Mart for Intensive Care IV (MIMIC IV) from 2008 to 2019. Patients 
with SAE were divided into a survival group (369 patients) and a non-survival 
group (96 patients). We used the Wilcoxon signed-rank test and the multivariate 
logistic regression analysis to analyze the relationship between serum ammonia 
levels and the prognosis of patients with SAE. R software was used to analyze 
the dataset.
RESULTS: The primary outcome was the relationship between serum ammonia level 
and hospital mortality of SAE. The secondary outcomes were the relationship 
between serum ammonia level and hospital stays, simplified acute physiology 
score (SAPS II), Charlson, Glasgow coma scale (GCS), sequential organ failure 
assessment (SOFA), and lactate level of SAE. The mortality of patients with SAE 
was 20.6%. The serum ammonia level was not significantly associated with 
hospital mortality, longer hospital stays, higher SAPS II and Charlson scores, 
and lower GCS of patients with SAE. The serum ammonia level was associated with 
higher SOFA scores and lactate levels in patients with SAE. The SAPS II and 
Charlson scores were independent risk factors for death in patients with SAE.
CONCLUSION: Serum ammonia level was associated with higher SOFA scores and 
lactate levels in patients with SAE. In addition, the SAPS II and Charlson 
scores can be used to assess the prognosis of patients with SAE. Therefore, we 
should closely monitor serum ammonia, SAPS II, and Charlson levels in patients 
with SAE.

BACKGROUND: Staphylococcus aureus bacteremia (SAB) remains a significant 
contributor to both community-acquired and healthcare-associated bloodstream 
infections. SAB exhibits a high recurrence rate and mortality rate, leading to 
numerous clinical treatment challenges. Particularly, since the outbreak of 
COVID-19, there has been a gradual increase in SAB patients, with a growing 
proportion of (Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus) MRSA infections. 
Therefore, we have constructed and validated a pediction model for recurrent SAB 
using machine learning. This model aids physicians in promptly assessing the 
condition and intervening proactively.
METHODS: The patients data is sourced from the Medical Information Mart for 
Intensive Care IV (MIMIC-IV) database version 2.2. The patients were divided 
into training and testing datasets using a 7:3 random sampling ratio. The 
process of feature selection employed two methods: Recursive Feature Elimination 
(RFE) and Least Absolute Shrinkage and Selection Operator (LASSO). Prediction 
models were built using Extreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost), Random Forest (RF), 
Logistic Regression (LR), Support Vector Machine (SVM), and Artificial Neural 
Network (ANN). Model validation included Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) 
analysis, Decision Curve Analysis (DCA), and Precision-Recall Curve (PRC). We 
utilized SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations) values to demonstrate the 
significance of each feature and explain the XGBoost model.
RESULTS: After screening, MRSA, PTT, RBC, RDW, Neutrophils_abs, Sodium, Calcium, 
Vancomycin concentration, MCHC, MCV, and Prognostic Nutritional Index(PNI) were 
selected as features for constructing the model. Through combined evaluation 
using ROC、 DCA and PRC, XGBoost demonstrated the best predictive performance, 
achieving an AUC value of 0.76 (95% CI: 0.66-0.85) in ROC and 0.56 (95% CI: 
0.37-0.75) in PRC. Building a website based on the Xgboost model. SHAP 
illustrated the feature importance ranking in the XGBoost model and provided 
examples to explain the XGBoost model.
CONCLUSIONS: The adoption of XGBoost for model development holds widespread 
acceptance in the medical domain. The prediction model for recurrent SAB, 
developed by our team, aids physicians in timely diagnosis and treatment of 
patients.

Objective: To construct and validate a predictive nomogram model for the 
survival of patients with ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) to enhance 
prediction of 28-day survival rate in critically ill patients with VAP. Methods: 
A total of 1,438 intensive care unit (ICU) patients with VAP were screened 
through Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care (MIMIC)-IV. On the basis of 
multi-variable Cox regression analysis data, nomogram performance in predicting 
survival status of patients with VAP at ICU admission for 7, 14, and 28 days was 
evaluated using the C-index and area under the curve (AUC). Calibration and 
decision curve analysis curves were generated to assess clinical value and 
effectiveness of model, and risk stratification was performed for patients with 
VAP. Result: Through stepwise regression screening of uni-variable and 
multi-variable Cox regression models, independent prognostic factors for 
predicting nomogram were determined, including age, race, body temperature, 
Sequential Organ Failure Assessment score, anion gap, bicarbonate concentration, 
partial pressure of carbon dioxide, mean corpuscular hemoglobin, and liver 
disease. The model had C-index values of 0.748 and 0.628 in the train and test 
sets, respectively. The receiver operating characteristic curve showed that 
nomogram had better performance in predicting 28-day survival status in the 
train set (AUC = 0.74), whereas it decreased in the test set (AUC = 0.66). 
Calibration and decision curve analysis curve results suggested that nomogram 
had favorable predictive performance and clinical efficacy. Kaplan-Meier curves 
showed significant differences in survival between low, medium, and high-risk 
groups in the total set and training set (log-rank p < 0.05), further validating 
the effectiveness of the model. Conclusion: The VAP patient admission ICU 7, 14, 
and 28-day survival prediction nomogram was constructed, contributing to risk 
stratification and decision-making for such patients. The model is expected to 
play a positive role in supporting personalized treatment and management of VAP.

The heterogeneity of critical illness complicates both clinical trial design and 
real-world management. This complexity has resulted in conflicting evidence and 
opinion regarding the optimal management in many intensive care scenarios. 
Understanding this heterogeneity is essential to tailoring management to 
individual patients. Hyperglycaemia is one such complication in the intensive 
care unit (ICU), accompanied by decades of conflicting evidence around 
management strategies. We hypothesized that analysis of highly-detailed 
electronic medical record (EMR) data would demonstrate that patients vary widely 
in their glycaemic response to critical illness and response to insulin therapy. 
Due to this variability, we believed that hyper- and hypoglycaemia would remain 
common in ICU care despite standardised approaches to management. We utilized 
the Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care III v1.4 (MIMIC) database. We 
identified 19,694 admissions between 2008 and 2012 with available glucose 
results and insulin administration data. We demonstrate that hyper- and 
hypoglycaemia are common at the time of admission and remain so 1 week into an 
ICU admission. Insulin treatment strategies vary significantly, irrespective of 
blood glucose level or diabetic status. We reveal a tremendous opportunity for 
EMR data to guide tailored management. Through this work, we have made available 
a highly-detailed data source for future investigation.

A simple prognostic model is needed for ICU patients. This study aimed to 
construct a modified prognostic model using easy-to-use indexes for prediction 
of the 28-day mortality of critically ill patients. Clinical information of ICU 
patients included in the Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care III 
(MIMIC-III) database were collected. After identifying independent risk factors 
for 28-day mortality, an improved mortality prediction model (mionl-MEWS) was 
constructed with multivariate logistic regression. We evaluated the predictive 
performance of mionl-MEWS using area under the receiver operating characteristic 
curve (AUROC), internal validation and fivefold cross validation. A nomogram was 
used for rapid calculation of predicted risks. A total of 51,121 patients were 
included with 34,081 patients in the development cohort and 17,040 patients in 
the validation cohort (17,040 patients). Six predictors, including Modified 
Early Warning Score, neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio, lactate, international 
normalized ratio, osmolarity level and metastatic cancer were integrated to 
construct the mionl-MEWS model with AUROC of 0.717 and 0.908 for the development 
and validation cohorts respectively. The mionl-MEWS model showed good validation 
capacities with clinical utility. The developed mionl-MEWS model yielded good 
predictive value for prediction of 28-day mortality in critically ill patients 
for assisting decision-making in ICU patients.

Author information:
(1)Clinical Laboratory, Affiliated Dongyang Hospital of Wenzhou Medical 
University, Dongyang, Zhejiang, 322100, People's Republic of China.

PURPOSE: Studies on the prognosis of critically ill older adult patients 
admitted to the emergency department (ED) but requiring immediate admission to 
the intensive care unit (ICU) remain limited. This study aimed to develop an 
in-hospital mortality prediction model for critically ill older adult patients 
transferred from the ED to the ICU.
PATIENTS AND METHODS: The training cohort was taken from the Medical Information 
Mart for Intensive Care IV (version 2.2) database, and the external validation 
cohort was taken from the Affiliated Dongyang Hospital of Wenzhou Medical 
University. In the training cohort, class balance was addressed using Random 
Over Sampling Examples (ROSE). Univariate and multivariate Cox regression 
analyses were performed to identify independent risk factors. These were then 
integrated into the predictive nomogram. In the validation cohort, the 
predictive performance of the nomogram was evaluated using the area under the 
curve (AUC) of the receiver operating characteristic curve, calibration curve, 
clinical utility decision curve analysis (DCA), and clinical impact curve (CIC).
RESULTS: In the ROSE-balanced training cohort, univariate and multivariate Cox 
regression analysis identified that age, sex, Glasgow coma scale score, 
malignant cancer, sepsis, use of mechanical ventilation, use of vasoactive 
agents, white blood cells, potassium, and creatinine were independent predictors 
of in-hospital mortality in critically ill older adult patients, and were 
included in the nomogram. The nomogram showed good predictive performance in the 
ROSE-balanced training cohort (AUC [95% confidence interval]: 0.792 
[0.783-0.801]) and validation cohort (AUC [95% confidence interval]: 0.780 
[0.727-0.834]). The calibration curves were well-fitted. DCA and CIC 
demonstrated that the nomogram has good clinical application value.
CONCLUSION: This study developed a predictive model for early prediction of 
in-hospital mortality in critically ill older adult patients transferred from 
the ED to the ICU, which was validated by external data and has good predictive 
performance.

BACKGROUND: High sepsis mortality rates pose a serious global health problem. 
Machine learning is a promising technique with the potential to improve 
mortality prediction for this disease in an accurate and timely manner.
OBJECTIVES: This study aimed to develop a model capable of rapidly and 
accurately predicting sepsis mortality using data that can be quickly obtained 
in an ambulance, with a focus on practical application during ambulance 
transport.
MATERIAL AND METHODS: Data from the Medical Information Mart for Intensive 
Care-IV (MIMIC-IV) dataset were used to compare the performance of 11 machine 
learning algorithms against the widely utilized quick Sequential Organ Failure 
Assessment (qSOFA) score. A dynamic updating model was implemented. Performance 
was evaluated using area under the curve (AUC) and precision-recall area under 
the curve (PRAUC) scores, and feature importance was assessed with SHapley 
Additive exPlanations (SHAP) values.
RESULTS: The light gradient boosting machine (LightGBM) model achieved the 
highest AUC (0.79) and PRAUC (0.44) scores, outperforming the qSOFA score (AUC = 
0.76, PRAUC = 0.40). The LightGBM also achieved the highest PRAUC (0.44), 
followed by Optuna_LightGBM (0.43) and random forest (0.42). The dynamically 
updated and tuned model further improved performance metrics (AUC = 0.79, PRAUC 
= 0.44) compared to the base model (AUC = 0.76, PRAUC = 0.39). Feature 
importance analysis offers clinicians insights for prioritizing patient 
assessments and interventions.
CONCLUSIONS: The LightGBM-based model demonstrated superior performance in 
predicting sepsis-related mortality in an ambulance setting. This study 
underscores the practical applicability of machine learning models, addressing 
the limitations of previous research, and highlights the importance of real-time 
updates and hyperparameter tuning in optimizing model performance.

In this study, we aim to elucidate the association between nondiabetic 
hyperglycemia and the short-term prognosis of critically ill patients with acute 
ischemic stroke. We extracted data using the Medical Information Mart for 
Intensive Care IV from 2008 to 2019. The primary outcomes were set as intensive 
care units (ICU) and in-hospital mortality. We developed a Cox proportional 
hazards model to determine the nonlinear association between serum glucose 
levels and primary outcomes. Of the 1086 patients included, 236 patients had 
hyperglycemia. Patients with hyperglycemia were associated with higher ages, 
female gender, higher Charlson Comorbidity Index scores, and higher Acute 
Physiology Score III scores. After propensity score matching, 222 pairs 
remained. The hyperglycemia group had a significantly higher ICU mortality 
(17.6% vs. 10.8%; p = 0.041). Meanwhile, no significant differences in ICU 
length of stay (5.2 vs. 5.2; p = 0.910), in-hospital mortality (26.6% vs. 18.9%, 
p = 0.054), and hospital length of stay (10.0 vs. 9.1; p = 0.404) were observed 
between the two groups. The Kaplan-Meier curves for ICU and in-hospital survival 
before matching suggested significant differences; however, after matching, they 
failed to prove any disparity. Non-diabetic patients with acute ischemic stroke 
have poor clinical characteristic while encountering hyperglycemic events; 
therefore, careful monitoring in the acute phase is still required.

OBJECTIVE: Early identifying sepsis patients who had higher risk of poor 
prognosis was extremely important. The aim of this study was to develop an 
artificial neural networks (ANN) model for early predicting clinical outcomes in 
sepsis.
METHODS: This study was a retrospective design. Sepsis patients from the Medical 
Information Mart for Intensive Care-III (MIMIC-III) database were enrolled. A 
predictive model for predicting 30-day morality in sepsis was performed based on 
the ANN approach.
RESULTS: A total of 2874 patients with sepsis were included and 30-day mortality 
was 29.8%. The study population was categorized into the training set (n = 1698) 
and validation set (n = 1176) based on the ratio of 6:4. 11 variables which 
showed significant differences between survivor group and nonsurvivor group in 
training set were selected for constructing the ANN model. In training set, the 
predictive performance based on the area under the receiver-operating 
characteristic curve (AUC) were 0.873 for ANN model, 0.720 for logistic 
regression, 0.629 for APACHEII score and 0.619 for SOFA score. In validation 
set, the AUCs of ANN, logistic regression, APAHCEII score, and SOFA score were 
0.811, 0.752, 0.607, and 0.628, respectively.
CONCLUSION: An ANN model for predicting 30-day mortality in sepsis was 
performed. Our predictive model can be beneficial for early detection of 
patients with higher risk of poor prognosis.

This study aimed to explore the association between admission hemoglobin level 
and clinical outcomes in sepsis based on Medical Information Mart for Intensive 
Care IV(MIMIC-IV) database. It was a retrospective study. Sepsis patients in the 
database were included. Data extraction from MIMIC-IV was performed by 
PostgreSQL 9.6 software. Three different models including crude model (adjusted 
for none), model I (adjusted for gender and age) and model II (adjusted for all 
potential cofounders) were constructed. A generalized liner model and a smooth 
fitting curve for indicating the relationship between hemoglobin level and 
30-day mortality were performed. 6249 septic patients with a 30.18% of 30-day 
mortality were included. With 1 g/dl increment in hemoglobin level, the values 
of odds ratio (OR) in crude model, model I and model II were 0.96 (95% 
confidential interval (CI) 0.94-0.99, P = 0.0023), 0.96 (95%CI 0.93-0.98, 
P = 0.0010) and 0.87 (95%CI 0.79-0.95, P = 0.0020), respectively. The smooth 
fitting curve indicated a non-linear relationship and the turning point was 
7.2 g/dl. Compared the hemoglobin group < 7.2 g/dl, the risk of 30-day mortality 
significantly decreased by 32% in the hemoglobin group ≥ 7.2 g/dl (OR = 0.68, 
95%CI 0.51-0.93, P = 0.0142). The non-linear relationship between admission 
hemoglobin level and 30-day mortality in sepsis was found. Hemoglobin 
supplementation might be beneficial for septic patients with hemoglobin 
level < 7.2 g/dl.

INTRODUCTION: Few studies have investigated the in-hospital mortality among 
critically ill patients with hip fracture. This study aimed to develop and 
validate a model to estimate the risk of in-hospital mortality among critically 
ill patients with hip fracture.
METHODS: For this study, data from the Medical Information Mart for Intensive 
Care III (MIMIC-III) Database and electronic Intensive Care Unit (eICU) 
Collaborative Research Database were evaluated. Enrolled patients (n=391) in the 
MIMIC-III database were divided into a training (2/3, n=260) and a validation 
(1/3, n=131) group at random. Using machine learning algorithms such as random 
forest, gradient boosting machine, decision tree, and eXGBoosting machine 
approach, the training group was utilized to train and optimize models. The 
validation group was used to internally validate models and the optimal model 
could be obtained in terms of discrimination (area under the receiver operating 
characteristic curve, AUROC) and calibration (calibration curve). External 
validation was done in the eICU Collaborative Research Database (n=165). To 
encourage practical use of the model, a web-based calculator was developed 
according to the eXGBoosting machine approach.
RESULTS: The in-hospital death rate was 13.81% (54/391) in the MIMIC-III 
database and 10.91% (18/165) in the eICU Collaborative Research Database. Age, 
gender, anemia, mechanical ventilation, cardiac arrest, and chronic airway 
obstruction were the six model parameters which were identified using the Least 
Absolute Shrinkage and Selection Operator (LASSO) method combined with 10-fold 
cross-validation. The model established using the eXGBoosting machine approach 
showed the highest area under curve (AUC) value (0.797, 95% CI: 0.696-0.898) and 
the best calibrating ability, with a calibration slope of 0.999 and intercept of 
-0.019. External validation also revealed favorable discrimination (AUC: 0.715, 
95% CI: 0.566-0.864; accuracy: 0.788) and calibration (calibration slope: 0.805) 
in the eICU Collaborative Research Database. The web-based calculator could be 
available at https://doctorwangsj-webcalculator-main-yw69yd.streamlitapp.com/.
CONCLUSION: The model has the potential to be a pragmatic risk prediction tool 
that is able to identify hip fracture patients who are at a high risk of 
in-hospital mortality in ICU settings, guide patient risk counseling, and 
simplify prognosis bench-marking by controlling for baseline risk.

Acute myocardial infarction (AMI) and sepsis are the leading causes of high 
mortality rates in intensive care units. While sepsis frequently affects the 
cardiovascular system, distinguishing between sepsis-induced cardiomyopathy and 
AMI remains challenging due to overlapping biomarkers. Misdiagnosis can hinder 
timely treatment and increase risk of complications. This study used 
multidimensional clinical data and machine learning techniques to develop and 
validate a novel predictive model for identifying AMI in critically ill patients 
with sepsis. Data from patients with sepsis were extracted from the Medical 
Information Mart for Intensive Care-IV database. Six machine learning algorithms 
were employed for model construction. Additionally, the machine learning-based 
models were compared with traditional scoring systems. Model performance was 
evaluated in terms of discrimination, calibration, and clinical applicability. 
In total, 2,103 critically ill patients with sepsis were included, 459 (21.8%) 
of whom experienced AMI during hospitalization. A total of 26 variables were 
selected for model construction. Among all models, the Gradient Boosting 
Classifier model demonstrated the best predictive performance in terms of 
discrimination, calibration, and clinical applicability. Machine learning models 
have the potential to serve as tools for predicting AMI in patients with sepsis. 
The Gradient Boosting Classifier model developed herein demonstrated promising 
predictive performance, supporting clinicians in identifying patients at 
high-risk of sepsis and implementing early interventions to reduce mortality 
rates.

BACKGROUND: Identifying sepsis patients with risk of in-hospital death early can 
improve the prognosis of patients. This study aimed to develop a model to 
predict in-hospital death of sepsis patients based on the Medical Information 
Mart for Intensive Care-Ⅲ (MIMIC-Ⅲ) database, and use clinical data to 
externally validate the model.
METHODS: A total of 1,839 sepsis patients were used for model development, and 
125 clinical cases were used for external validation. The discriminatory ability 
of the model was determined by calculating the area under the curve (AUC) with 
95% confidence intervals (CI).
RESULTS: The AUC of the random forest model and logistic regression model was 
0.754 (95%CI, 0.732-0.776) and 0.703 (95%CI, 0.680-0.727), respectively, and the 
random forest model had higher AUC (Z = 3.070, P = .002). External validation 
showed that the AUC of the random forest model was 0.539 (95%CI, 0.440-0.628). 
Further validation was carried out according to gender and SOFA score. The AUC 
of the model in males and females was 0.648 and 0.412, respectively. In 
addition, the AUC of the model in the population with SOFA scores of 3-8, 9-12, 
and 13-15 were 0.705, 0.495, and 0.769, respectively.
CONCLUSIONS: The random forest model had a better predictive ability and a good 
applicability to external populations with SOFA score of 13-15.

OBJECTIVES: Identifying high-risk patients in the intensive care unit (ICU) is 
important given the high mortality rate. However, existing scoring systems lack 
easily accessible, low-cost and effective inflammatory markers. We aimed to 
identify inflammatory markers in routine blood tests to predict mortality in ICU 
patients and evaluate their predictive power.
DESIGN: Retrospective case-control study.
SETTING: Single secondary care centre.
PARTICIPANTS: We analysed data from the Medical Information Mart for Intensive 
Care III database. A total of 21 822 ICU patients were enrolled and divided into 
survival and death groups based on in-hospital mortality.
PRIMARY AND SECONDARY OUTCOME MEASURES: The predictive values of potential 
inflammatory markers were evaluated and compared using receiver operating 
characteristic curve analysis. After identifying the neutrophil-to-lymphocyte 
ratio (NLR) as having the best predictive ability, patients were redivided into 
low (≤1), medium (1-6) and high (>6) NLR groups. Univariate and multivariate 
logistic regression analyses were performed to evaluate the association between 
the NLR and mortality. The area under the curve (AUC), net reclassification 
improvement (NRI) and integrated discrimination improvement (IDI) were used to 
assess whether incorporating the NLR could improve the predictive power of 
existing scoring systems.
RESULTS: The NLR had the best predictive ability (AUC: 0.609; p<0.001). 
In-hospital mortality rates were significantly higher in the low (OR (OR): 2.09; 
95% CI 1.64 to 2.66) and high (OR 1.64; 95% CI 1.50 to 1.80) NLR groups than in 
the medium NLR group. Adding the NLR to the Simplified Acute Physiology Score II 
improved the AUC from 0.789 to 0.798, with an NRI and IDI of 16.64% and 0.27%, 
respectively.
CONCLUSIONS: The NLR predicted mortality in ICU patients well. Both low and high 
NLRs were associated with elevated mortality rates, including the NLR may 
improve the predictive power of the Simplified Acute Physiology Score II.

OBJECTIVE: To explore the relationship between lactate-to-albumin ratio (LAR) at 
ICU admission and prognosis in critically ill patients with acute kidney injury 
(AKI).
METHODS: A retrospective analysis was conducted. Patients were divided into low 
(<0.659) LAR and high LAR (≥0.659) groups. Least absolute shrinkage and 
selection operator regression analysis was conducted to select variables 
associated with the 30-day prognosis. Cox regression analyses were performed to 
assess the association between LAR and mortality. Kaplan-Meier curves were 
plotted to compare cumulative survival rates between high and low LAR groups. 
Subgroup analysis was employed to assess the stability of the results. ROC curve 
was used to determine the diagnostic efficacy of LAR on prognosis.
RESULTS: A nonlinear relationship was observed between LAR and the risk of 
30-day and 360-day all-cause mortality in AKI patients (p < 0.001). Cox 
regulation showed that high LAR (≥ 0.659) was an independent risk factor for 
30-day and 360-day all-cause mortality in patients with AKI (p < 0.001). The 
Kaplan-Meier survival curves demonstrated a noteworthy decrease in cumulative 
survival rates at both 30 and 360 days for the high LAR group in comparison to 
the low LAR group (p < 0.001). Subgroup analyses demonstrated the stability of 
the results. ROC curves showed that LAR had a diagnostic advantage when compared 
with lactate or albumin alone (p < 0.001).
CONCLUSION: High LAR (≥0.659) at ICU admission was an independent risk factor 
for both short-term (30-day) and long-term (360-day) all-cause mortality in 
patients with AKI.

Deep learning models (aka Deep Neural Networks) have revolutionized many fields 
including computer vision, natural language processing, speech recognition, and 
is being increasingly used in clinical healthcare applications. However, few 
works exist which have benchmarked the performance of the deep learning models 
with respect to the state-of-the-art machine learning models and prognostic 
scoring systems on publicly available healthcare datasets. In this paper, we 
present the benchmarking results for several clinical prediction tasks such as 
mortality prediction, length of stay prediction, and ICD-9 code group prediction 
using Deep Learning models, ensemble of machine learning models (Super Learner 
algorithm), SAPS II and SOFA scores. We used the Medical Information Mart for 
Intensive Care III (MIMIC-III) (v1.4) publicly available dataset, which includes 
all patients admitted to an ICU at the Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center from 
2001 to 2012, for the benchmarking tasks. Our results show that deep learning 
models consistently outperform all the other approaches especially when the 
'raw' clinical time series data is used as input features to the models.

Sepsis-related mortality rates are high among elderly patients, especially those 
in intensive care units (ICUs). Early prediction of the prognosis of sepsis is 
critical, as prompt and effective treatment can improve prognosis. Researchers 
have predicted mortality and the development of sepsis using machine learning 
algorithms; however, few studies specifically focus on elderly patients with 
sepsis. This paper proposes a viable model for early prediction of in-hospital 
mortality among elderly patients diagnosed with sepsis. We extracted patient 
information from the Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care IV database. We 
employed several machine learning algorithms to predict the in-hospital 
mortality of elderly ICU patients with sepsis. The performance of the model was 
evaluated by using the AUROC and F1 score. Furthermore, the SHAP algorithm was 
used to explain the model, analyze how the individual features affect the model 
output, and visualize the Shapley value for a single individual. Our study 
included 18522 elderly patients, with a mortality of 15.4%. After screening, 59 
clinical variables were extracted to develop models. Feature importance analysis 
showed that age, PO2, RDW, SPO2, WBC, and urine output were significantly 
related to the in-hospital mortality. According to the results of AUROC (0.871 
(95% CI: 0.854-0.888)) and F1 score (0.547 (95% CI: 0.539-0.661)) analyses, the 
extreme gradient boosting (XGBoost) model outperformed the other models (i.e., 
LGBM, LR, RF, DT, and KNN). Furthermore, SHAP force analysis illustrated how the 
constructed model visualized the individualized prediction of death. XGBoost 
machine learning framework gives good in-hospital mortality prediction of 
elderly patients with sepsis and can maximize prediction model accuracy. The 
XGBoost model could be an effective tool to assist doctors in identifying 
high-risk cases of in-hospital mortality among elderly patients with sepsis. 
This could be used to create a clinical decision support system in the future.

Association between Lactate Dehydrogenase and 30-Day Mortality in Patients with 
Sepsis: a Retrospective Cohort Study.

Liu Z, Liu F, Liu C, Chen X.

BACKGROUND: Sepsis is one of the major causes of death in intensive care unit 
patients, so it is urgent to explore indicators for rapid and effective 
screening of sepsis mortality risk. The purpose of this study is to explore the 
association of LDH level with 30-day mortality in sepsis patients to improve 
patient survival outcomes.
METHODS: In this retrospective cohort study, a total of 5,275 patients with 
sepsis from the Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care IV (MIMIC-IV). LDH 
level at admission was obtained, and the outcome indicator was the 30-day 
mortality. Multivariate Cox regression and Kaplan-Meier survival curve analysis 
were used to assess the relationship between LDH level and 30-day mortality in 
patients with sepsis.
RESULTS: A total of 5,275 patients with sepsis were screened, the 30-day 
mortality was 51.5%. In multivariate regression models, hazard ratio [HR] and 
95% confidence interval [CI] for Log2 and LDH ≥ 250 UI/L were 1.33 (1.29 - 1.37) 
and 1.69 (1.54 - 1.85), respectively. Kaplan-Meier survival curve analysis 
suggested that LDH level is associated with prognosis in patients with sepsis.
CONCLUSIONS: LDH level was associated with 30-day mortality, which can be used 
as an important predictor of clinical outcomes for patients.

OBJECTIVES: Unplanned readmissions to the intensive care unit (ICU) are highly 
undesirable, increasing variance in care, making resource planning difficult and 
potentially increasing length of stay and mortality in some settings. 
Identifying patients who are likely to suffer unplanned ICU readmission could 
reduce the frequency of this adverse event.
SETTING: A single academic, tertiary care hospital in the UK.
PARTICIPANTS: A set of 3326 ICU episodes collected between October 2014 and 
August 2016. All records were of patients who visited an ICU at some point 
during their stay. We excluded patients who were ≤16 years of age; visited ICUs 
other than the general and neurosciences ICU; were missing crucial electronic 
patient record measurements; or had indeterminate ICU discharge outcomes or very 
early or extremely late discharge times. After exclusion, 2018 outcome-labelled 
episodes remained.
PRIMARY AND SECONDARY OUTCOME MEASURES: Area under the receiver operating 
characteristic curve (AUROC) for prediction of unplanned ICU readmission or 
in-hospital death within 48 hours of first ICU discharge.
RESULTS: In 10-fold cross-validation, an ensemble predictor was trained on data 
from both the target hospital and the Medical Information Mart for Intensive 
Care (MIMIC-III) database and tested on the target hospital's data. This 
predictor discriminated between patients with the unplanned ICU readmission or 
death outcome and those without this outcome, attaining mean AUROC of 0.7095 (SE 
0.0260), superior to the purpose-built Stability and Workload Index for Transfer 
(SWIFT) score (AUROC=0.6082, SE 0.0249; p=0.014, pairwise t-test).
CONCLUSIONS: Despite the inherent difficulties, we demonstrate that a novel 
machine learning algorithm based on transfer learning could achieve good 
discrimination, over and above that of the treating clinicians or the value 
added by the SWIFT score. Accurate prediction of unplanned readmission could be 
used to target resources more efficiently.

BACKGROUND: Inflammation is involved in the development and progression of 
atherosclerosis. Recent studies indicated that glucose-to-lymphocyte ratio (GLR) 
level were significantly associated with the risk of mortality from inflammatory 
diseases, and showed a specific prognostic value. Herein, this study intended to 
explore the association between GLR level and in-hospital mortality in patients 
with acute myocardial infarction (AMI), and evaluate the predictive value of GLR 
on AMI prognosis.
METHODS: Data of patients with AMI were extracted from the Medical Information 
Mart for Intensive Care IV (MIMIC-IV) database in 2012-2019 in this 
retrospective cohort study. Univariate COX proportional hazard model was used to 
screen covariates. The associations between GLR and in-hospital mortality were 
evaluated using univariate and multivariate COX proportional hazard models. 
Subgroup analysis of age, gender, vasopressor use, SOFA scores, renal 
replacement therapy, coronary artery bypass graft, and β blockers use were 
performed. The evaluated index was hazard ratios (HRs) and 95% confidence 
intervals (CIs). In addition, the predictive performance of GLR, glucose, and 
lymphocytes on in-hospital mortality was assessed respectively.
RESULTS: Among eligible patients, 248 (13.74%) died in the hospital. After 
adjusting for covariates, we found that a higher GLR level was associated with 
an increased risk of in-hospital mortality [HR = 1.70, 95%CI: (1.24-2.34)]. This 
relationship was also found in patients who were male, aged ≥65 years old, did 
not have renal replacement therapy, coronary artery bypass graft, or β blockers, 
used vasopressor or not, and whatever the SOFA scores (all P<0.05). Moreover, 
the predictive performance of GLR on in-hospital mortality seemed superior to 
that of glucose or lymphocytes.
CONCLUSION: GLR may be a potential predictor for AMI prognosis, which provided 
some references for identifying and managing high-risk populations early in 
clinical.

BACKGROUND Hyperammonemia has been reported in some critically ill patients with 
sepsis who do not have hepatic failure. A significant proportion of patients 
with non-hepatic hyperammonemia have underlying sepsis, but the association 
between non-hepatic hyperammonemia and prognosis is unclear. MATERIAL AND 
METHODS Information about patients with sepsis and non-hepatic hyperammonemia 
was retrieved from the Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care-III database. 
Survival rates were analyzed using the Kaplan-Meier method. Multivariate 
logistic regression models were employed to identify prognostic factors. 
Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis was used to measure the 
predictive ability of ammonia in terms of patient mortality. RESULTS A total of 
265 patients with sepsis were enrolled in this study. Compared with the 
non-hyperammonemia group, the patients with hyperammonemia had significantly 
higher rates of hospital (59.8% vs. 43.0%, P=0.007), 30-day (47.7% vs. 34.8%, 
P=0.036), 90-day (61.7% vs. 43.7%, P=0.004), and 1-year mortality (67.3% vs. 
49.4%, P=0.004). In the survival analysis, hyperammonemia was associated with 
these outcomes. Serum ammonia level was an independent predictor of hospital 
mortality. The area under the ROC curve for the ammonia levels had poor 
discriminative capacity. The hyperammonemia group also had significantly lower 
Glasgow Coma Scale scores (P=0.020) and higher incidences of delirium (15.9% vs. 
8.2%, P=0.034) and encephalopathy (37.4% vs. 19.6%, P=0.001). Intestinal 
infection and urinary tract infection with organisms such as Escherichia coli 
may be risk factors for hyperammonemia in patients who have sepsis. CONCLUSIONS 
Higher ammonia levels are associated with poorer prognosis in patients with 
sepsis. Ammonia also may be associated with sepsis-associated encephalopathy. 
Therefore, we recommend that serum ammonia levels be measured in patients who 
are suspected of having sepsis.

OBJECTIVE: The influence of serum sodium level changes on septic patient 
survival after cardiopulmonary bypass surgery is not clear. We attempted to 
figure out the impact of serum sodium trajectory changes on the 30-day mortality 
rate of such patients.
METHODS: The Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care (MIMIC)-IV database was 
searched to gather patients who developed sepsis after cardiopulmonary bypass 
surgery. A group-based trajectory model (GBTM) was employed to determine the 
serum sodium trajectory within 72 h of ICU admission. Patients' survival 
differences between different trajectory groups were compared using Kaplan-Meier 
(K-M) survival curves. Cox regression models were further employed to explore 
the correlation between survival status and serum sodium trajectory.
RESULTS: 1,038 eligible patients were involved in this project. GBTM identified 
3 serum sodium trajectories, all showing a trend of initial decrease followed by 
an increase. K-M curve analysis uncovered a notable difference in 30-day 
survival status between Class 1 and Class 2 (Log-rank p = 0.039), while no 
obvious differences were observed between other groups. Cox hazard analysis 
revealed that in the three models adjusting for different covariates, Class 2 
was connected with the increased risk of survival (OR > 1, p < 0.05).
CONCLUSION: Higher serum sodium trajectory is linked with elevated 30-day death 
risk in septic patients following cardiopulmonary bypass surgery. Repressing 
high levels of serum sodium may be beneficial for patient survival.

Cardiac arrest (CA) poses a significant global health challenge and often 
results in poor prognosis. We developed an interpretable and applicable machine 
learning (ML) model for predicting in-hospital mortality of CA patients who 
survived more than 72 h. A total of 721 patients were extracted from the Medical 
Information Mart for Intensive Care IV database, divided into the training set 
(n = 576) and the internal validation set (n = 145). The external validation set 
containing 856 cases were collected from four tertiary hospitals in Zhejiang 
Province. The primary outcome was in-hospital mortality. Eleven ML algorithms 
were utilized to establish prediction models based on data from 72 h after 
return of spontaneous circulation (ROSC). The results indicate that the CatBoost 
model exhibited the best performance at 72 h. Eleven variables were ultimately 
selected as key features by recursive feature elimination (RFE) to construct a 
compact model. The final model achieved the highest AUC of 0.86 (0.80, 0.92) in 
the internal validation and 0.76 (0.73, 0.79) in the external validation. SHAP 
summary plots and force plots visually explained the predicted outcomes. In 
conclusion, 72-h CatBoost showed promising performance in predicting in-hospital 
mortality of CA patients who survived more than 72 h. The model still requires 
further optimization and improvement.

BACKGROUND: The global volume of gastrointestinal surgery has increased 
steadily. However, there is still a lack of studies focused on the risk factors 
for post-gastrointestinal resection surgery patients in the intensive care 
units.
METHODS: Post gastrointestinal resection surgery patient data were collected 
from the Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care (MIMIC-III) database and 
divided into training set and validation set, then analyzed by Univariate and 
multiple logistic regression.
RESULTS: 795 patients were finally enrolled in our cohort. Multiple logistic 
regression showed that age (1.029 [1.006-1.053]), temperature (0.337 
[0.207-0.547]), respiratory rate (1.133 [1.053-1.218]), mean arterial pressure 
(1.204 [1.039-1.396]), lactate (1.288 [1.112-1.493]), BUN (1.025 [1.010-1.040]) 
and vasopressor use (4.777 [2.499-9.130]) were independent factors associated 
with in-hospital mortality. Our new predicted nomogram achieved a better 
accuracy than SOFA score, SAPS-Ⅱ score, APACHE-Ⅲ score, and Elixhauser score.
CONCLUSION: Our nomogram model could well predict in-hospital mortality for 
post-GI resection surgery patients receiving intensive care.

BACKGROUND: The lack of transparency is a prevalent issue among the current 
machine-learning (ML) algorithms utilized for predicting mortality risk. Herein, 
we aimed to improve transparency by utilizing the latest ML explicable 
technology, SHapley Additive exPlanation (SHAP), to develop a predictive model 
for critically ill patients.
METHODS: We extracted data from the Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care 
IV database, encompassing all intensive care unit admissions. We employed nine 
different methods to develop the models. The most accurate model, with the 
highest area under the receiver operating characteristic curve, was selected as 
the optimal model. Additionally, we used SHAP to explain the workings of the ML 
model.
RESULTS: The study included 21 395 critically ill patients, with a median age of 
68 years (interquartile range, 56-79 years), and most patients were male 
(56.9%). The cohort was randomly split into a training set (N = 16 046) and a 
validation set (N = 5349). Among the nine models developed, the Random Forest 
model had the highest accuracy (87.62%) and the best area under the receiver 
operating characteristic curve value (0.89). The SHAP summary analysis showed 
that Glasgow Coma Scale, urine output, and blood urea nitrogen were the top 
three risk factors for outcome prediction. Furthermore, SHAP dependency analysis 
and SHAP force analysis were used to interpret the Random Forest model at the 
factor level and individual level, respectively.
CONCLUSION: A transparent ML model for predicting outcomes in critically ill 
patients using SHAP methodology is feasible and effective. SHAP values 
significantly improve the explainability of ML models.

Several commonly used scoring systems (SOFA, SAPS II, LODS, and SIRS) are 
currently lacking large sample data to confirm the predictive value of 30-day 
mortality from sepsis, and their clinical net benefits of predicting mortality 
are still inconclusive. The baseline data, LODS score, SAPS II score, SIRS 
score, SOFA score, and 30-day prognosis of patients who met the diagnostic 
criteria of sepsis were retrieved from the Medical Information Mart for 
Intensive Care III (MIMIC-III) intensive care unit (ICU) database. Receiver 
operating characteristic (ROC) curves and comparisons between the areas under 
the ROC curves (AUC) were conducted. Decision curve analysis (DCA) was performed 
to determine the net benefits between the four scoring systems and 30-day 
mortality of sepsis. For all cases in the cohort study, the AUC of LODS, SAPS 
II, SIRS, SOFA were 0.733, 0.787, 0.597, and 0.688, respectively. The 
differences between the scoring systems were statistically significant (all 
P-values < 0.0001), and stratified analyses (the elderly and non-elderly) also 
showed the superiority of SAPS II among the four systems. According to the DCA, 
the net benefit ranges in descending order were SAPS II, LODS, SOFA, and SIRS. 
For stratified analyses of the elderly or non-elderly groups, the results also 
showed that SAPS II had the most net benefit. Among the four commonly used 
scoring systems, the SAPS II score has the highest predictive value for 30-day 
mortality from sepsis, which is better than LODS, SIRS, and SOFA. The results of 
the DCA curves show that using the SAPS II score to predict the 30-day mortality 
of intensive care patients with sepsis to guide clinical applications may obtain 
the highest net benefit.

OBJECTIVE: Recent studies have shown that blood urea nitrogen to creatinine 
(BUN/Cr) ratio might be an effective marker for the prognosis of patients with 
respiratory diseases. Herein, we aimed to assess the association between BUN/Cr 
ratio and the risk of in-hospital mortality in patients with trauma-related 
acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS).
DESIGN: A retrospective cohort study.
SETTING AND PARTICIPANTS: 1034 patients were extracted from the Medical 
Information Mart for Intensive Care-III (MIMIC-III) database.
PRIMARY AND SECONDARY OUTCOME MEASURES: The primary outcome of the study was 
in-hospital mortality, defined by the vital status at the time of hospital 
discharge (ie, survivors and non-survivors).
RESULTS: Of the total patients, 191 (18.5%) died in hospital. The median 
follow-up duration was 16.0 (8.3-26.6) days. The results showed that high level 
of BUN/Cr ratio was significantly associated with an increased risk of 
in-hospital mortality (15.54-21.43: HR=2.00, 95% CI: (1.18 to 3.38); >21.43: 
HR=1.76, 95% CI: (1.04 to 2.99)) of patients with trauma-related ARDS. In 
patients with trauma-related ARDS that aged ≥65 years old, male and female, 
Onychomycosis Severity Index (OSI)>98, Revised Trauma Score (RTS)>11, Simplified 
Acute Physiology Score II (SAPS-II)>37 and sequential organ failure assessment 
(SOFA) scores≤7, BUN/Cr ratio was also related to the increased risk of 
in-hospital mortality (all p<0.05). The predictive performance of BUN/Cr ratio 
for in-hospital mortality was superior to BUN or Cr, respectively, with the area 
under the curve of receiver operator characteristic curve at 0.6, and that 
association was observed in age, gender, OSI, RTS, SAPS-II and SOFA score 
subgroups.
CONCLUSION: BUN/Cr ratio may be a potential biomarker for the risk of 
in-hospital mortality of trauma-related ARDS, which may help the clinicians to 
identify high-risk individuals and to implement clinical interventions.

OBJECTIVES: Acute respiratory failure increases short-term mortality in sepsis 
patients. Hence, in this study, we aimed to develop a novel model for predicting 
the risk of hospital mortality in sepsis patients with acute respiratory 
failure.
METHODS: From the Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care (MIMIC)-IV 
database, we developed a matched cohort of adult sepsis patients with acute 
respiratory failure. After applying a multivariate COX regression analysis, we 
developed a nomogram based on the identified risk factors of mortality. Further, 
we evaluated the ability of the nomogram in predicting individual hospital death 
by the area under a receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve.
RESULTS: A total of 663 sepsis patients with acute respiratory failure were 
included in this study. Systolic blood pressure, neutrophil percentage, white 
blood cells count, mechanical ventilation, partial pressure of oxygen < 60 mmHg, 
abdominal cavity infection, Klebsiella pneumoniae and Acinetobacter baumannii 
infection, and immunosuppressive diseases were the independent risk factors of 
mortality in sepsis patients with acute respiratory failure. The area under the 
ROC curve of the nomogram was 0.880 (95% CI: 0.851-0.908), which provided 
significantly higher discrimination compared to that of the simplified acute 
physiology score II [0.656 (95% CI: 0.612-0.701)].
CONCLUSION: The model shows a good performance in predicting the mortality risk 
of patients with sepsis-related acute respiratory failure. Hence, this model can 
be used to evaluate the short-term prognosis of critically ill patients with 
sepsis and acute respiratory failure.

BACKGROUND: For patients with multiple organ dysfunction syndrome (MODS), timely 
assessment of the condition and real-time adjustment of the treatment plan are 
of critical importance. To this end, transthoracic echocardiography (TTE) is 
widely used in clinical practice, but whether TTE can improve the short-term 
prognosis of MODS patients is currently unclear.
METHODS: We extracted data of patients from the Medical Information Mart for 
Intensive Care III (MIMIC-III) database and included cases according to 
inclusion and exclusion criteria. The primary endpoint was the mortality within 
28 days after admission to the intensive care unit (ICU), and multi-variate 
regression analysis was conducted to infer the risk factors associated death 
within 28 days after ICU admission. Double robust analysis was conducted to 
investigate the correlation between TTE and the endpoint. A gradient-boosted 
model (GBM) was constructed to calculate the propensity score (PS) of patients 
received TTE, so as to reduce the difference of variates between these two 
groups.
RESULTS: A total of 13,844 MODS cases were included and were divided into a TTE 
group and a non-TTE group. There were 5,022 cases (36.28%) in the TTE group, 
2,416 (48.10%) of whom were female; and 8,822 (63.72%) in the non-TTE group, 
4,129 of whom (46.80%) were female. The covariates that contributed 
significantly to PS included chronic heart failure (CHF), creatine kinase (CK), 
troponin, partial pressure of oxygen (PO2), and sequential organ failure 
assessment (SOFA) scores. Double robust analysis showed that within 28 days 
after ICU admission, the TTE group had lower risk of death when compared with 
the non-TTE group. The adjusted odds ratio (OR) value of TTE for 28 days death 
was 0.73 [95% confidence interval (CI): 0.65-0.82; P<0.001]. The other 3 models 
had similar results, suggesting that conduct TTE for patients with MODS in ICU 
was associated with lower risk of 28 days mortality.
CONCLUSIONS: TTE can reduce the mortality of MODS patients in the ICU.

BACKGROUND: The broad adoption of electronic health records (EHRs) provides 
great opportunities to conduct health care research and solve various clinical 
problems in medicine. With recent advances and success, methods based on machine 
learning and deep learning have become increasingly popular in medical 
informatics. However, while many research studies utilize temporal structured 
data on predictive modeling, they typically neglect potentially valuable 
information in unstructured clinical notes. Integrating heterogeneous data types 
across EHRs through deep learning techniques may help improve the performance of 
prediction models.
METHODS: In this research, we proposed 2 general-purpose multi-modal neural 
network architectures to enhance patient representation learning by combining 
sequential unstructured notes with structured data. The proposed fusion models 
leverage document embeddings for the representation of long clinical note 
documents and either convolutional neural network or long short-term memory 
networks to model the sequential clinical notes and temporal signals, and 
one-hot encoding for static information representation. The concatenated 
representation is the final patient representation which is used to make 
predictions.
RESULTS: We evaluate the performance of proposed models on 3 risk prediction 
tasks (i.e. in-hospital mortality, 30-day hospital readmission, and long length 
of stay prediction) using derived data from the publicly available Medical 
Information Mart for Intensive Care III dataset. Our results show that by 
combining unstructured clinical notes with structured data, the proposed models 
outperform other models that utilize either unstructured notes or structured 
data only.
CONCLUSIONS: The proposed fusion models learn better patient representation by 
combining structured and unstructured data. Integrating heterogeneous data types 
across EHRs helps improve the performance of prediction models and reduce 
errors.

Intensive care units (ICUs) are responsible for generating a wealth of useful 
data in the form of electronic health records. We aimed to build a mortality 
prediction model on a Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care (MIMIC-III) 
database and to assess whether the use of deep learning techniques like long 
short-term memory (LSTM) can effectively utilize the temporal relations among 
clinical variables. The models were built on clinical variable dynamics of the 
first 48 h of ICU admission of 12,550 records from the MIMIC-III database. A 
total of 36 variables including 33 time series variables and three static 
variables were used for the prediction. We present the application of LSTM and 
LSTM attention (LSTM-AT) model for mortality prediction with such a large number 
of clinical variables dataset. For training and validation purpose, we have used 
International Classification of Diseases, 9th edition (ICD-9) codes for 
extracting the patients with cardiovascular disease, and infections and 
parasitic disease, respectively. The effectiveness of the LSTM model is achieved 
over non-recurrent baseline models like naïve Bayes, logistic regression (LR), 
support vector machine and multilayer perceptron (MLP) by generating state of 
the art results (area under the curve [AUC], 0.852). Next, by providing 
attention at each time stamp, we developed a model, LSTM-AT, which exhibits even 
better performance (AUC, 0.876).

BACKGROUND: Acute kidney injury (AKI) is a common problem in the intensive care 
unit (ICU). Transthoracic echocardiography (TTE) has become a common test in the 
ICU. But the effect of TTE on the short-term prognosis in ICU patients with AKI 
remains unclear. We aimed to analyze the relationship between TTE and short-term 
prognosis in ICU patients with AKI.
METHODS: AKI patients in the Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care 
(MIMIC)-III database were retrospectively enrolled according to inclusion and 
exclusion criteria, and their clinical information was extracted. TTE was 
conducted during ICU stay. AKI was diagnosed according to KIDGO criteria. The 
primary endpoint was the outcome of 28-day ICU stay. The doubly robust 
estimation method was used to analyze the association of TTE with the primary 
and secondary outcomes of patients with AKI in ICU. The gradient boosted model 
(GBM) was used to estimate the propensity score of patients to undergo TTE 
examination, thereby minimizing the variable imbalance between the TTE and 
non-TTE groups. Weighted cohorts were built using the inverse probabilities 
weighting (IPW) model with estimated propensity scores as weights. The weighted 
cohort was analyzed using logistic regression and validated using other models.
RESULTS: A total of 2,983 patients were included. In the original cohort, 28-day 
mortality was 37.9% in the TTE group (n=1,684) and 40.8% in the non-TTE group 
(n=1,299). In the propensity score model (PSM) cohort, 28-day mortality was 
34.6% in the TTE group (n=702) and 45.6% in the non-TTE group (n=702). Doubly 
robust analysis showed that TTE was associated with lower 28-day mortality.
CONCLUSIONS: TTE examination might decrease the 28-day mortality in patients 
with AKI in the ICU and should be considered for critical patients when 
necessary.

BACKGROUND: Sepsis presents a significant healthcare challenge, characterized by 
high morbidity and mortality rates. There is a scarcity of relevant studies 
investigating the association between serum lactate dehydrogenase level and the 
prognosis of sepsis in patients from intensive care unit, with smaller sample 
sizes compared to other studies.
METHODS: A retrospective analysis was conducted utilizing data from the Second 
Affiliated Hospital of Guangzhou Medical University and the Medical Information 
Mart for Intensive Care IV (MIMIC-IV). The primary outcome was the in-hospital 
mortality. Multivariate Cox proportional hazards regression was adopted to 
assess the independent association. Receiver operator characteristic (ROC) curve 
was used to evaluate the predictive value.
RESULTS: We included a total of 2148 patients in the Guangzhou Sepsis Cohort 
(GZSC) database and 5830 patients in the MIMIC-IV database. In multivariate Cox 
proportional hazards regression, high levels of LDH are significantly associated 
with higher mortality (HR = 1.21, 95% CI 1.13-1.30, p < 0.001 in the GZSC 
database and HR = 1.19, 95% CI 1.13-1.25, p < 0.001 in the MIMIC-IV database). 
The ROC curves showed that the AUC of LDH was 0.663 in the GZSC database and 
0.660 in the MIMIC-IV database.
CONCLUSIONS: A lower lactate dehydrogenase level is associated with reduced 
in-hospital mortality among patients with sepsis, suggesting its potential as a 
valuable marker for predicting prognosis in this patient population.

PURPOSE: To develop and validate a user-friendly model to predict the risk of 
in-hospital mortality in solid cancer patients admitted to the ICU with sepsis.
METHODS: Clinical data of critically ill patients with solid cancer and sepsis 
were obtained from Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care-IV database and 
randomly assigned to the training cohort and validation cohort. The primary 
outcome was in-hospital mortality. The least absolute shrinkage and selection 
operator (LASSO) regression and logistic regression analysis were used to 
feature selection and model development. The performance of the model was 
validated and a dynamic nomogram was developed to visualize the model.
RESULTS: A total of 1584 patients were included in this study, of whom 1108 were 
assigned to the training cohort and 476 to the validation cohort. The LASSO 
regression and logistic multivariable analysis showed that nine clinical 
features were associated with in-hospital mortality and enrolled in the model. 
The area under the curve of the model was 0.809 (95% CI 0.782-0.837) in the 
training cohort and 0.770 (95% CI 0.722-0.819) in the validation cohort. The 
model exhibited satisfactory calibration curves and Brier scores in the training 
set and validation set were 0.149 and 0.152, respectively. The decision curve 
analysis and clinical impact curve of the model presented good clinical 
practicability in both the two cohorts.
CONCLUSION: This predictive model could be used to assess the in-hospital 
mortality of solid cancer patients with sepsis in the ICU, and a dynamic online 
nomogram could facilitate the sharing of the model.

Improving the In-Hospital Mortality Prediction of Diabetes ICU Patients Using a 
Process Mining/Deep Learning Architecture.

Theis J, Galanter WL, Boyd AD, Darabi H.

Diabetes intensive care unit (ICU) patients are at increased risk of 
complications leading to in-hospital mortality. Assessing the likelihood of 
death is a challenging and time-consuming task due to a large number of 
influencing factors. Healthcare providers are interested in the detection of ICU 
patients at higher risk, such that risk factors can possibly be mitigated. While 
such severity scoring methods exist, they are commonly based on a snapshot of 
the health conditions of a patient during the ICU stay and do not specifically 
consider a patient's prior medical history. In this paper, a process mining/deep 
learning architecture is proposed to improve established severity scoring 
methods by incorporating the medical history of diabetes patients. First, health 
records of past hospital encounters are converted to event logs suitable for 
process mining. The event logs are then used to discover a process model that 
describes the past hospital encounters of patients. An adaptation of Decay 
Replay Mining is proposed to combine medical and demographic information with 
established severity scores to predict the in-hospital mortality of diabetes ICU 
patients. Significant performance improvements are demonstrated compared to 
established risk severity scoring methods and machine learning approaches using 
the Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care III dataset.

OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to develop and validate a machine 
learning-based predictive model that predicts 90-day mortality in ICU trauma 
patients.
METHODS: Data of patients with severe trauma were extracted from the Medical 
Information Mart for Intensive Care III (MIMIC-III) database. The performances 
of mortality prediction models generated using nine machine learning extreme 
gradient boosting (XGBoost), logistic regression, random forest, AdaBoost, 
multilayer perceptron (MLP) neural networks, support vector machine (SVM), light 
gradient boosting machine (GBM), k nearest neighbors (KNN) and gaussian naive 
bayes (GNB). The performance of the model was evaluated in terms of 
discrimination, calibration and clinical application.
RESULTS: We found that the accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, PPV, NPV and F1 
score of our proposed XGBoost model were 82.8%, 79.7%, 77.6%, 51.2%, 91.5% and 
0.624, respectively. Among the nine models, the XGBoost model performed best. 
Compared with traditional logistic regression, the calibration curves of the 
XGBoost model and decision curve analysis (DCA) performed well.
CONCLUSION: Our study shows that the XGBoost model outperforms other machine 
learning models in predicting 90-day mortality in trauma patients. It can be 
used to assist clinicians in the early identification of mortality risk factors 
and early intervention to reduce mortality.

BACKGROUND: Disorders of serum sodium are common among general patients and are 
associated with poor outcomes. The prognostic value of serum sodium disorders in 
patients with acute pancreatitis (AP) has not been studied. We conducted this 
retrospective study to explore the association between serum sodium levels and 
the outcomes of patients with AP.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: Patients with AP from the Medical Information Mart for 
Intensive Care III (MIMIC-III) were screened for this study. The laboratory 
variables, including serum sodium levels, were obtained by analyzing the first 
blood sample on the first day after admission. Univariate logistic regression 
was performed to discover potential factors for mortality of AP. The unadjusted 
and adjusted association between serum sodium level and mortality of AP was 
shown by the restricted cubic spline (RCS). The categorical cutoff for the 
detrimental effect of serum sodium level on the prognosis of AP was also 
confirmed by stepwise logistic regression after adjusting for con-founding 
effects of significant factors in the univariate logistic regression.
RESULTS: A total of 869 patients with AP in the MIMIC-III were included with a 
mortality of 13.1%. Unadjusted logistic regression showed that age (p < 0.001), 
simplified acute physiological score (SAPS) (p < 0.001), systolic blood pressure 
(p < 0.001), diastolic blood pressure (p < 0.001), hemoglobin (p = 0.040), serum 
creatinine (p = 0.046), and serum phosphorus (p < 0.001) were significantly 
associated with the mortality of AP. The RCS showed that the serum sodium level 
was negatively and linearly associated with mortality of AP after adjusting for 
confounding effects of significant factors in the univariate logistic 
regression. Serum sodium < 133 mmol/L, which indicated hyponatremia, was 
significantly correlated with a higher mortality risk than serum 
sodium ≥ 133 mmol/L (p = 0.013).
CONCLUSIONS: Hyponatremia is widely developed among patients with AP and 
correlates with a higher mortality risk of AP. Physicians should pay more 
attention to managing patients with AP with hyponatremia.

BACKGROUND: A great increase in the number of patients needs critical care to 
the intensive care unit (ICU) due to improvements in oncology. The aim of the 
study was to explore risk factors affecting survival of critically ill patients 
with solid cancers in ICU.
METHODS: The study retrospectively reviewed patients between 2001 and 2012, 
which were collected by Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care III 
(MIMIC-III) from the Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center in Boston, MA, USA.
RESULTS: A total of 38,508 adult patients, who were admitted to ICUs and 8,308 
(21.6%) were diagnosed as an underlying malignancy; 1,671 and 3,165 adult 
patients with sold cancer were admitted to surgical ICU (SICU) and medical ICU 
(MICU), respectively. Patients in SICU had a higher survival rate at the point 
of 28-, 90-day, and 1-, 3-year than patients in MICU (P<0.001 for all). 
Multivariate analysis demonstrated that age ≥70, emergency admission, the 
presence of metastases, Oxford Acute Severity of Illness Score (OASIS) ≥30 and 
sepsis were independent risk factors affecting 28-day survival in SICU. In MICU, 
emergency admission, metastatic disease, Sequential Organ Failure Assessment 
(SOFA) ≥3, Simplified Acute Physiology Score II (SAPS II) ≥39, Acute Physiology 
Score III (APS III) ≥40, Oxford Acute Severity of Illness Score (OASIS) ≥30, 
Elixhauser comorbidity index ≥9 and sepsis were independent risk factors for 
28-day survival rate. The area under curve (AUC) of the OASIS for predicting ICU 
mortality was 0.824 [95% confidence interval (CI): 0.805-0.842], which was 
obviously higher than other scores in SICU. The AUC of the SAPS II for 
predicting ICU mortality was 0.820 (95% CI: 0.806-0.833), which was slightly 
higher than other scores in MICU.
CONCLUSIONS: Patients with cancer in SICU have longer survival time than 
patients with cancer in MICU. The prediction of prognosis of critically ill 
cancer patients can guide treatment and optimize medical resources.

OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to characterize long-term cerebral perfusion 
pressure (CPP) trajectory in traumatic brain injury (TBI) patients and construct 
an interpretable prediction model to assess the risk of unfavorable CPP 
evolution patterns.
METHODS: TBI patients with CPP records were identified from the Medical 
Information Mart for Intensive Care (MIMIC)-IV 2.1, eICU Collaborative Research 
Database (eICU-CRD) 2.0, and HiRID dataset 1.1.1. The research process consisted 
of 2 stages. First, group-based trajectory modeling (GBTM) was used to identify 
different CPP trajectories. Second, different artificial neural network (ANN) 
algorithms were used to predict the trajectories of CPP.
RESULTS: A total of 331 eligible patients' records from MIMIC-IV 2.1 and 
eICU-CRD 2.0 were used for trajectory analysis and model development. 
Additionally, 310 patients' data from HiRID were used for external validation. 
The GBTM identified 5 CPP trajectory groups, group 1 and group 5 were merged 
into class 1 based on unfavorable in-hospital mortality. The best 6 predictors 
were invasive systolic blood pressure coefficient of variation, venous blood 
chloride ion concentration, PaCO2, prothrombin time, CPP coefficient of 
variation, and mean CPP. Compared with other algorithms, Scaled Conjugate 
Gradient performed relatively better in identifying class 1.
CONCLUSIONS: This study identified 2 CPP trajectory groups associated with 
elevated risk and 3 with reduced risk. PaCO2 might be a strong predictor for the 
unfavorable CPP class. The ANN model achieved the primary goal of risk 
stratification, which is conducive to early intervention and individualized 
treatment.

In hospitals, one of the dominant issues is the development of an accurate and 
precise nursing management system which is hard to implement due to the various 
problems in the implementation of the traditional manual system. For this 
purpose, we are to solve the imperfect functions of the traditional nursing 
information management system and the strong subjectivity and low accuracy of 
the way of manually judging the patient's condition. Firstly, the Immune Genetic 
Algorithm (IGA) is used to optimize the Backpropagation Neural Network (BPNN). A 
mortality prediction model using IGA-BPNN is proposed. Secondly, a nursing 
information management system for critically ill patients in neurosurgery is 
designed. The IGA-BPNN prediction model is used as a part of the system to 
predict the mortality of critically ill patients. Finally, the performance of 
the predictive model and the system is tested using the Medical Information Mart 
for Intensive Care (MIMIC)-III data set design experiment. The results show the 
following: (1) Precision, Recall, and F1-score of mortality prediction using the 
IGA-BPNN model are 7.2%, 7.2%, and 7.3% higher than those of other prediction 
models. The designed model has better performance. (2) The comprehensive 
performance of the system during operation can reach the standard. The 
researched content aims to provide important technical support for the nursing 
information management of critically ill patients in neurosurgery and the 
intelligent analysis of patients' condition.

OBJECT: This study aimed to develop and validate a set of practical predictive 
tools that reliably estimate the 28-day prognosis of acute kidney injury 
patients undergoing continuous renal replacement therapy.
METHODS: The clinical data of acute kidney injury patients undergoing continuous 
renal replacement therapy were extracted from the Medical Information Mart for 
Intensive Care IV database with structured query language and used as the 
development cohort. An all-subset regression was used for the model screening. 
Predictive models were constructed via a logistic regression, and external 
validation of the models was performed using independent external data.
RESULTS: Clinical prediction models were developed with clinical data from 1,148 
patients and validated with data from 121 patients. The predictive model based 
on seven predictors (age, vasopressor use, red cell volume distribution width, 
lactate, white blood cell count, platelet count, and phosphate) exhibited good 
predictive performance, as indicated by a C-index of 0.812 in the development 
cohort, 0.811 in the internal validation cohort and 0.768 in the external 
validation cohort.
CONCLUSIONS: The model reliably predicted the 28-day prognosis of acute kidney 
injury patients undergoing continuous renal replacement therapy. The predictive 
items are readily available, and the web-based prognostic calculator 
(https://libo220284.shinyapps.io/DynNomapp/) can be used as an adjunctive tool 
to support the management of patients.

BACKGROUND: Previous studies suggest that septic patients often have elevated 
triglyceride levels due to various factors, and higher levels may indicate a 
poorer prognosis. However, few studies have investigated whether lower 
triglycerides are associated with a better prognosis.
METHODS: The Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care IV (MIMIC-IV) database 
provided all the data. To assess the association between triglycerides and 
prognosis, we used logistic regression analysis (LR), least absolute shrinkage 
and selection operator (LASSO) and Cox proportional hazards models.
RESULTS: Inclusion criteria were met by a total of 804 patients with a mean 
triglyceride of 103 mg/dL. We found that patients had a higher risk of 30-day 
ICU mortality when triglycerides were in the second quartile (74-103 mg/dL). 
Interestingly, this group of patients seems to benefit more from the use of 
atorvastatin.
CONCLUSION: Our study showed that septic patients with triglyceride levels in 
the second quartile (74-103 mg/dL) have a higher 30-day ICU mortality rate 
compared to those with triglyceride levels in other quartiles.

PURPOSE: Venous thromboembolism (VTE) is a common complication of intracerebral 
hemorrhage (ICH) patients in intensive care unit (ICU), but anticoagulation 
therapy of ICH patients with VTE remains controversial. We aim to explore the 
risk factors and prognosis of anticoagulation therapy in ICH patients with VTE.
PATIENTS AND METHODS: Medical records of ICH patients were collected from the 
Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care III (MIMIC-III version 1.4) 
database. The risk factors and prognosis of anticoagulation therapy in ICH 
patients with VTE were assessed by multivariable logistic regression analysis 
and Kaplan-Meier survival analysis, respectively.
RESULTS: A total of 848 ICH patients were included in our study, of whom 69 ICH 
patients with VTE were screened, including 58 patients with deep vein thrombosis 
(DVT), 12 patients with pulmonary embolism (PE), and 1 patient with DVT and PE. 
In the multivariable logistic regression analysis, malignancy (odds ratio (OR): 
4.262, 95% confidence interval (CI): 2.263-8.027, P=0.000), pulmonary 
circulation disease (OR: 28.717, 95% CI: 9.566-86.208, P=0.000), coagulopathy 
(OR: 2.453, 95% CI: 1.098-5.483, P=0.029), age > 60 years old (OR: 2.138, 95% 
CI: 1.087-4.207, P=0.028) and hospitalization time > 16 days (OR: 2.548, 95% CI: 
1.381-4.701, P=0.003) were independent risk factors for VTE in ICH patients. 
Kaplan-Meier survival analysis and log-rank test found that, compared to 
non-anticoagulation group, anticoagulation group had higher cumulative survival 
rates during hospitalization, 28-day, 3-month, 1-year, and 4-year after 
admission, respectively.
CONCLUSION: Malignancy, pulmonary circulation disease, coagulopathy, age >60 
years old and hospitalization time >16 days were independent risk factors for 
VTE in ICH patients, and anticoagulation therapy for VTE in ICH patients may be 
safe and effective. These findings need to be verified by more high-quality and 
well-designed randomized controlled trials.

District, Shanghai 200092, China.

BACKGROUND: Although the measurement of central venous pressure (CVP) is a 
common clinical tool, the role of CVP monitoring in the outcome of sepsis is 
controversial because threshold values of CVP are uncertain, and there are only 
limited data on short-term survival of patients with septic acute kidney injury 
(AKI).
METHODS: This retrospective cohort study was based on the Medical Information 
Mart for Intensive Care IV (MIMIC-IV) database (source of the training dataset). 
Multivariate regression analysis was performed to clarify the relation between 
CVP measurement and clinical outcomes, and a univariate regression model after 
propensity score matching was utilized to validate our findings. A mortality 
prediction model for septic AKI and a risk stratification scoring approach were 
developed, and the emergency intensive care unit (eICU) database was used for 
external validation.
RESULTS: Of the 9170 patients in the training set, 2446 (26.7%) underwent CVP 
measurement. No significant association was found between CVP monitoring and 
28-day mortality among patients with septic AKI (odds ratio = 0.479; 95% 
confidence interval 0.213-1.076, P = 0.075), even after adjustments (propensity 
score matching; P = 0.178). Length of ICU stay and hospital stay was markedly 
reduced in patients undergoing CVP measurement within 3 hours (median 6.2 and 
10.9 days, respectively, P < 0.001). The addition of the mean perfusion pressure 
initial, CVP, and the magnitude of the CVP change within 48 hours to the model 
significantly increased model discrimination (area under the receiver operating 
characteristic curve: 0.867 and 0.780, respectively, P < 0.001).
CONCLUSIONS: These findings suggest that CVP measurement alone has little effect 
on the outcome of septic AKI. Nonetheless, initial CVP levels and the dynamic 
changes in CVP within the first 48 hours after ICU admission and the mean 
perfusion pressure initial can improve the accuracy of outcome prediction 
models.

BACKGROUND: Vitamin D plays a critical role in the regulation of multiple 
physiological pathways. Vitamin D deficiency may be a risk factor for 
life-threatening clinical conditions. Several studies have found that vitamin D 
supplementation in critically ill patients improves prognosis. The purpose of 
this study was to determine the association between vitamin D and the prognosis 
of patients with acute respiratory failure (ARF).
METHODS: In this retrospective cohort study, we collected clinical information 
of ARF patients from the Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care IV 
(MIMIC-IV) version 2.0 database. The outcome of this study was in-hospital 
mortality, intensive care unit (ICU) mortality. Patients were divided into the 
no-vitamin D and vitamin D groups according to whether they received 
supplementation or not. The correlation between vitamin D and outcome was 
examined using Kaplan-Meier (KM) survival curves, Cox proportional risk 
regression models and subgroup analyses. Propensity-score matching (PSM) was 
used to ensure the robustness of our findings.
RESULTS: The study finally included 7,994 patients with ARF, comprising 6,926 
and 1,068 in the no-vitamin D and vitamin D groups, respectively. The 
Kaplan-Meier survival curve indicated a significant difference in survival 
probability between the two groups. After adjustment for a series of 
confounders, the multivariate Cox proportional hazards models showed that the 
hazard ratio (95% confidence interval) values for in-hospital and ICU mortality 
in the no-vitamin D group were 1.67 (1.45, 1.93) and 1.64 (1.36, 1.98), 
respectively. The results of propensity score-matched (PSM) analysis were 
consistent with the original population. In the subgroup analysis, Vitamin D 
supplementation was associated with lower in-hospital mortality in patients with 
higher clinical scores (SOFA score ≥ 8, OASIS ≥ 38).
CONCLUSION: Our study concluded that Vitamin D supplementation may reduce 
in-hospital and ICU mortality in patients with ARF in the ICU. There may be a 
beneficial effect on in-hospital mortality in patients with higher clinical 
scores. Additional randomized controlled trials are needed to follow up to 
confirm the relationship between vitamin D supplementation and ARF.

BACKGROUND: Some patients with psychotropic drug poisoning need intensive care 
unit (ICU) admission, but risk prediction models for prolonged ICU stays are 
lacking.
OBJECTIVES: Develop and evaluate a prediction model for prolonged ICU stays in 
patients with psychotropic drug poisoning.
METHODS: The clinical data of patients with psychotropic drug poisoning were 
collected from the Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care (MIMIC)-Ⅳ 2.2 
database. Patients were grouped by their ICU length of stay: non-prolonged (<2 
days) and prolonged (≥2 days). Variable selection methods included LASSO and 
logistic regression. The selected variables were used to construct the model, 
which was subsequently evaluated for discrimination, calibration, and clinical 
utility.
RESULTS: The cohort included 413 patients with psychotropic drug poisoning, 49.4 
% male, with a median age of 41 years. The variables stepwise selected for model 
construction through LASSO and logistic regression include sepsis, SAPS Ⅱ, heart 
rate, respiratory rate, and mechanical ventilation. The model showed good 
discrimination with an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve 
(AUC) of 0.785 (95 % CI: 0.736-0.833) and was validated well with bootstrap 
internal validation (AUC: 0.792, 95 % CI: 0.745-0.839). Calibration curves 
indicated good fit (χ2 = 4.148, P = 0.844), aligning observed and predicted 
rates of prolonged ICU stays. Decision curve analysis (DCA) showed positive net 
benefits across a threshold probability range of 0.07-0.85.
CONCLUSIONS: The model developed in this study may help predict the risk of 
prolonged ICU stays for patients with psychotropic drug poisoning.

BACKGROUND: The number of studies applying machine learning (ML) to predict 
acute kidney injury (AKI) has grown steadily over the past decade. We assess and 
critically appraise the state of the art in ML models for AKI prediction, 
considering performance, methodological soundness, and applicability.
METHODS: We searched PubMed and ArXiv, extracted data, and critically appraised 
studies based on the Transparent Reporting of a Multivariable Prediction Model 
for Individual Prognosis or Diagnosis (TRIPOD), Checklist for Critical Appraisal 
and Data Extraction for Systematic Reviews of Prediction Modelling Studies 
(CHARMS), and Prediction Model Risk of Bias Assessment Tool (PROBAST) 
guidelines.
RESULTS: Forty-six studies from 3166 titles were included. Thirty-eight studies 
developed a model, five developed and externally validated one, and three 
studies externally validated one. Flexible ML methods were used more often than 
deep learning, although the latter was common with temporal variables and text 
as predictors. Predictive performance showed an area under receiver operating 
curves ranging from 0.49 to 0.99. Our critical appraisal identified a high risk 
of bias in 39 studies. Some studies lacked internal validation, whereas external 
validation and interpretability of results were rarely considered. Fifteen 
studies focused on AKI prediction in the intensive care setting, and the 
US-derived Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care (MIMIC) data set was 
commonly used. Reproducibility was limited as data and code were usually 
unavailable.
CONCLUSIONS: Flexible ML methods are popular for the prediction of AKI, although 
more complex models based on deep learning are emerging. Our critical appraisal 
identified a high risk of bias in most models: Studies should use calibration 
measures and external validation more often, improve model interpretability, and 
share data and code to improve reproducibility.

BACKGROUND: The relationship between albumin corrected anion gap (ACAG) and 
in-hospital mortality of intensive care sepsis patients is currently 
inconclusive.
METHODS: The baseline data, concentration of albumin, anion gap (AG), ACAG and 
in-hospital prognosis of intensive care patients with sepsis were retrieved from 
the Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care IV database. Propensity score 
matching (PSM) analysis was performed to reduce bias. Receiver operating 
characteristic curves were drawn for albumin, AG, and ACAG, and comparisons 
between the areas under the ROC curves were conducted. Decision curve analysis 
(DCA) was performed to determine the net benefit of ACAG.
RESULTS: ACAG was related to in-hospital mortality in intensive care patients 
with sepsis. The AUCs of ACAG were 0.689 (before PSM) and 0.644 (after PSM), 
which were significantly higher than that of albumin or AG. The Youden's index 
of ACAG was the highest, and the net benefit range of ACAG was also the largest 
according to the DCA.
CONCLUSIONS: ACAG has the highest predictive value for in-hospital mortality of 
intensive care patients with sepsis, which is better than albumin and AG. Using 
ACAG to predict the in-hospital mortality to guide clinical applications may 
obtain the highest net benefit.

OBJECTIVE: To assess the effect of serum inorganic phosphate (Pi) on the 
prognosis of patients with sepsis.
METHODS: A retrospective analysis of patients with sepsis selected from the 
Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care (MIMIC)-IV database was performed. 
Sepsis was diagnosed according to the Third International Consensus Definition 
for sepsis and septic shock (Sepsis-3). The time-weighted values of the serum Pi 
measurements within the first 24 h of sepsis were analyzed. The association 
between serum Pi and in-hospital mortality was evaluated with a generalized 
linear model (log-binomial model).
RESULTS: The analysis of 11,658 patients from six intensive care units (ICUs) 
showed a nearly linear correlation between serum Pi and in-hospital mortality in 
all patients with sepsis, especially in those with acute kidney injury (AKI). 
The increase of serum Pi was related to a higher risk of AKI, higher 
norepinephrine doses, ICU mortality, and in-hospital mortality. The generalized 
linear model showed that serum Pi was an independent predictor for in-hospital 
mortality in all patients with sepsis even within the normal range. The adjusted 
risk ratios (RRs) were also significant in subgroup analyses according to kidney 
function, gender, respiratory infection, vasopressor use, and Sequential Organ 
Failure Assessment (SOFA) score.
CONCLUSION: Higher levels of serum Pi, even within the normal range, were 
significantly associated with a higher risk of in-hospital mortality in patients 
with sepsis regardless of kidney function, gender, respiratory infection, 
vasopressor use, and SOFA score.

BACKGROUND: There are no tools specifically designed to assess mortality risk in 
patients with atrial fibrillation (AF).
AIMS: This study aimed to utilize machine learning methods to identify pertinent 
variables and develop an easily applicable prognostic score to predict 1-year 
mortality in AF patients.
METHODS: This study, based on the Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care-IV 
(MIMIC-IV) database, focused on patients aged 18 years and older with AF. A 
critical care database from China was the external validation set. The 
importance of variables from XGBoost guided the development of a logistic model, 
forming the basis for an AF scoring model.
RESULTS: Records of of 26 365 AF patients were obtained from the MIMIC-IV 
database. The external validation dataset included 231 AF patients. The CRAMB 
score (Charlson comorbidity index, readmission, age, metastatic solid tumor, and 
maximum blood urea nitrogen concentration) outperformed the CCI and CHA2DS2-VASc 
scores, demonstrating superior predictive value for 1-year mortality. In the 
test set, the area under the receiver operating characteristic (AUC) for the 
CRAMB score was 0.765 (95% confidence interval [CI], 0.753-0.776), while in the 
external validation set, it was 0.582 (95% CI, 0.502-0.657).
CONCLUSIONS: The simplicity of the CRAMB score makes it user-friendly, allowing 
for coverage of a broader and more heterogeneous AF population.

STUDY OBJECTIVE: To explore the impact of pre-hospital ACEI and ARB exposure on 
the prognosis of ARF patients.
DESIGN: A single-center retrospective cohort study.
SETTING: Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care-III (MIMIC-III) database.
PATIENTS: The patients meeting ICD-9 code of acute respiratory failure were 
enrolled.
INTERVENTION: The primary exposure was the pre-hospital exposure of ACEI and 
ARB.
MEASUREMENT AND MAIN RESULTS: The primary outcome was in-hospital mortality. 
Multiple logistic regression analysis was conducted to determine the independent 
effect of ACEI/ARB exposure on mortality. Propensity score matching (PSM) method 
was adopted to reduce bias of the confounders. Subgroup analysis and sensitivity 
analysis were used to test the stability of the conclusion. 5335 adult ARF 
patients were enrolled. Mortality was significantly decreased in patients with 
ACEI/ARB exposure before and after PSM, and the adjusted odds ratio (OR) of 
ACEI/ARB exposure was 0.56 (95% CI 0.43-0.72). In the subgroup analysis, 
ACEI/ARB lost its protective effect in young subgroup, but no significant 
interaction was found between ACEI/ARB exposure and age (p = 0.082). The point 
estimation and lower 95% limit of E-value was 2.97 and 2.12. In sensitivity 
analysis, ACEI/ARB exposure showed similar effect in ARDS cohort, but no 
significantly difference was found in the MIMIC-IV database, which may be 
explained by small sample size of the ACEI/ARB group.
CONCLUSIONS: Among patients with acute respiratory failure, pre-hospital 
ACEI/ARB exposure was associated with better outcomes and acted as an 
independent factor. The relationship between ACEI/ARB and prognosis of ARF is 
worth investigating further.

This study aimed to investigate the association between serum chloride levels 
and all-cause mortality in critically ill patients with chronic obstructive 
pulmonary disease (COPD). Data from the Medical Information Mart for Intensive 
Care IV (MIMIC-IV) database were extracted for analysis. Demographic 
information, laboratory results, medical histories, vital signs, and 
prognosis-related data were collected. Cox proportional hazard models were used 
to assess the relationship between serum chloride levels and 90-day and 365-day 
mortality. Subgroup analyses were conducted to explore potential interactions 
between serum chloride levels and various factors. The study included patients 
with a median age of 72.00 years, of whom 52.39% were male. Higher quartiles of 
serum chloride levels were associated with significantly lower levels of weight, 
RBC, platelet, hemoglobin, and other variables (P < 0.05), accompanied by lower 
90-day and 365-day mortality (P < 0.05). Cox proportional hazard model indicated 
that the risk of death was significantly lower in the fourth quartile of serum 
chloride levels compared with the first quartile after adjusting for confounders 
(90-day HR = 0.54, 365-day HR = 0.52, both P < 0.05). An L-shape relationship 
was observed, with risks of death decreasing as serum chloride levels increased, 
although the magnitude decreased when levels reached 102 mmol/L. This study 
demonstrated an independent L-shaped association between serum chloride levels 
and all-cause mortality in critically ill patients with COPD. This finding helps 
us to understand the prognostic value of serum chloride levels in critically ill 
patients with COPD.

Transforming raw EHR data into machine learning model-ready inputs requires 
considerable effort. One widely used EHR database is Medical Information Mart 
for Intensive Care (MIMIC). Prior work on MIMIC-III cannot query the updated and 
improved MIMIC-IV version. Besides, the need to use multicenter datasets further 
highlights the challenge of EHR data extraction. Therefore, we developed an 
extraction pipeline that works on both MIMIC-IV and eICU Collaborative Research 
Database and allows for model cross validation using these 2 databases. Under 
the default choices, the pipeline extracted 38,766 and 126,448 ICU records for 
MIMIC-IV and eICU, respectively. Using the extracted time-dependent variables, 
we compared the Area Under the Curve (AUC) performance with ​​prior works on 
clinically relevant tasks such as in-hospital mortality prediction. METRE 
achieved comparable performance with AUC 0.723-0.888 across all tasks with 
MIMIC-IV. Additionally, when we evaluated the model directly on MIMIC-IV data 
using a model trained on eICU, we observed that the AUC change can be as small 
as +0.019 or -0.015. Our open-source pipeline transforms MIMIC-IV and eICU into 
structured data frames and allows researchers to perform model training and 
testing using data collected from different institutions, which is of critical 
importance for model deployment under clinical contexts. The code used to 
extract the data and perform training is available here:

OBJECTIVE: Several studies show that chronic opioid dependence leads to higher 
in-hospital mortality, increased risk of hospital readmissions, and worse 
outcomes in trauma cases. However, the association of outpatient prescription 
opioid use on morbidity and mortality has not been adequately evaluated in a 
critical care setting. The purpose of this study was to determine if there is an 
association between chronic opioid use and mortality after an ICU admission.
DESIGN: A single-center, longitudinal retrospective cohort study of all 
Intensive Care Unit (ICU) patients admitted to a tertiary-care academic medical 
center from 2001 to 2012 using the MIMIC-III database.
SETTING: Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care III database based in the 
United States.
PATIENTS: Adult patients 18 years and older were included. Exclusion criteria 
comprised of patients who expired during their hospital stay or presented with 
overdose; patients with cancer, anoxic brain injury, non-prescription opioid 
use; or if an accurate medication reconciliation was unable to be obtained. 
Patients prescribed chronic opioids were compared with those who had not been 
prescribed opioids in the outpatient setting.
INTERVENTIONS: None.
MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: The final sample included a total of 22,385 
patients, with 2,621 (11.7%) in the opioid group and 19,764 (88.3%) in the 
control group. After proceeding with bivariate analyses, statistically 
significant and clinically relevant differences were identified between opioid 
and non-opioid users in sex, length of hospital stay, and comorbidities. Opioid 
use was associated with increased mortality in both the 30-day and 1-year 
windows with a respective odds ratios of 1.81 (95% CI, 1.63-2.01; p<0.001) and 
1.88 (95% CI, 1.77-1.99; p<0.001), respectively.
CONCLUSIONS: Chronic opioid usage was associated with increased hospital length 
of stay and increased mortality at both 30 days and 1 year after ICU admission. 
Knowledge of this will help providers make better choices in patient care and 
have a more informed risk-benefits discussion when prescribing opioids for 
chronic usage.

BACKGROUND: Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) complicated by atrial 
fibrillation (AF) in ICU patients is associated with higher risks of adverse 
outcomes. The red cell distribution width to albumin ratio (RAR), may predict 
mortality in critical illness, yet its link to 28-day mortality in ICU patients 
with COPD and AF remains unclear.
METHODS: This retrospective cohort study analyzed 693 ICU patients with COPD and 
AF from the Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care IV (MIMIC-IV) database, 
grouped by RAR tertiles. The primary endpoint was 28-day mortality, with 
secondary endpoints including 90-day, 365-day, and ICU mortality. Multivariate 
cox models estimated hazard ratios (HRs) for mortality, while restricted cubic 
spline regression assessed the linearity of the RAR-mortality relationship. 
Kaplan-Meier curves compared survival across tertiles, and subgroup analyses 
explored RAR's impact across age, gender, race, and comorbidities.
RESULTS: Our study included 693 ICU patients with both COPD and AF, with an 
average age of 74.9 years. The 28-day mortality was 30.7%. Patients in the 
highest RAR tertile had significantly worse 28-day survival (p < 0.0001). Higher 
RAR was linearly associated with increased 28-day mortality (p for 
non-linearity > 0.05), with each 1-unit increase in RAR linked to an 18% rise in 
mortality risk (95% CI: 1.08-1.29). Sensitivity analyses confirmed RAR's 
relevance for 90-day, 365-day, and ICU mortality.
CONCLUSIONS: RAR is independently associated with 28-day mortality in COPD 
patients with AF. Elevated RAR levels correlate with higher 28-day mortality 
rates in this population.

BACKGROUND: Coronary atherosclerosis is one of the main cardiovascular diseases 
affecting the global population. Coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) is 
commonly used to improve the survival probability of patients with coronary 
atherosclerosis. However, the prognosis of patients after CABG remains unclear.
OBJECTIVES: We aimed to construct a novel nomogram comprising readily available 
indicators to predict the 1-, 2-, and 3-year survival rates after CABG in 
patients with coronary atherosclerosis.
METHODS: We utilized the Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care III 
(MIMIC-III) database for the study. The calibration plot, concordance index 
(C-index), net reclassification index (NRI), integrated discrimination 
improvement (IDI), and area under the receiver operating characteristic curve 
(AUROC) were used to evaluate the performance of the model, and to compare the 
nomogram with the Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (SOFA) score and 
Simplified Acute Physiology Score II (SAPS II) in order to illustrate the 
clinical effectiveness of the model.
RESULTS: The multivariate Cox regression model showed that age, marital status, 
body mass index, creatinine, platelet count, red cell distribution width, heart 
rate, intensive-care unit stay time, and Elixhauser Comorbidity Index were risk 
factors. The C-indexes of the nomogram exceeded 0.75, and its NRI and IDI were 
both higher than 0. The AUROCs were larger for the nomogram than for the SAPS II 
and SOFA score.
CONCLUSION: Our new nomogram is a personalized tool that helps clinicians choose 
treatment options and predict the long-term prognosis of patients.

OBJECTIVE: Critically ill patients with liver cirrhosis generally have a poor 
prognosis due to complications such as multiple organ failure. This study aims 
to develop a machine learning-based prediction model to forecast short-term 
mortality in critically ill cirrhotic patients in the intensive care unit (ICU), 
thereby assisting clinical decision-making for intervention and treatment.
METHODS: Machine learning models were developed using clinical data from 
critically ill cirrhotic patients in the MIMIC database, with multicenter 
validation performed using data from the eICU database and Qinghai University 
Affiliated Hospital(QUAH). Various machine learning models, including a Stacking 
ensemble model, were employed, with the SHAP method used to enhance model 
interpretability.
RESULTS: The Stacking ensemble model demonstrated superior predictive 
performance through internal and external validation, with AUC and AP values 
surpassing those of individual algorithms. The AUC values were 0.845 in the 
internal validation set, 0.819 in the eICU external validation, and 0.761 in the 
QUAH validation set. Additionally, the SHAP method highlighted key prognostic 
variables such as INR, bilirubin, and urine output. The model was ultimately 
deployed as a web-based calculator for bedside decision-making.
CONCLUSION: The machine learning model effectively predicts short-term mortality 
risk in critically ill cirrhotic patients in the ICU, showing strong predictive 
performance and generalizability. The model's robust interpretability and its 
deployment as a web-based calculator suggest its potential as a valuable tool 
for assessing the prognosis of cirrhotic patients.

BACKGROUND: No studies have been published on the correlation between lactic 
dehydrogenase-to-albumin ratio (LAR) and poor prognosis of acute kidney injury 
(AKI) patients, warranting further research. This analysis sought to investigate 
the prognostic implication of LAR in critically ill patients with AKI.
METHODS: The present study enrolled 11,046 and 5180 adults with AKI from the 
Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care III (MIMIC III) and MIMIC IV, 
respectively. Data from MIMIC IV were identified as the training 
cohort, and those from MIMIC III were identified as the validation cohort. We 
applied multivariate regression analysis to identify the link between LAR and 
all-cause mortality. Restricted cubic spline (RCS) was conducted to figure out 
the correlation between LAR and in-hospital mortality. Furthermore, we carried 
out stratification analyses to examine if the effects of LAR on in-hospital 
mortality were consistent across various subclasses.
RESULTS: The level of LAR was remarkably higher in the in-hospital non-survivor 
group (p < 0.001). Furthermore, the increased LAR group presented a remarkably 
higher rate of in-hospital mortality at AKI stages 1, 2, and 3 compared with the 
decreased LAR group (all p < 0.001). Multivariate regression analyses exhibited 
the independent prognostic significance of LAR for all-cause mortality (all 
p < 0.001). MIMIC III observed concordant results. RCS indicated a non-linear 
correlation between LAR and in-hospital death (P for non-linearity < 0.001). The 
relationship between LAR and in-hospital mortality was still significant in 
patients with various subclasses.
CONCLUSIONS: Elevated LAR at admission is a prognostic risk factor for 
critically ill patients with AKI.

OBJECTIVES: Patients with sepsis are often comorbid with acute respiratory 
distress syndrome (ARDS), and the phenotypic characteristics of pulmonary and 
non-pulmonary infections leading to ARDS are still unclear. This study aimed to 
compare the phenotypic characteristics of ARDS resulting from pulmonary 
infections and other non-site infections and provide better guidance for 
clinical treatment.
METHODS: We conducted a multicenter cohort analysis using data from the Tianjin 
Medical University General Hospital, Medical Information Mart for Intensive 
Care-IV (MIMIC-IV), and the electronic intensive care unit (eICU) databases. The 
study population consisted of adult patients diagnosed with sepsis and ARDS. The 
primary objectives were to compare the characteristics and outcomes of patients 
with pulmonary infection-induced ARDS and those with non-pulmonary 
infection-induced ARDS using Wilcoxon analysis, Kaplan-Meier curves, correlation 
analysis, propensity matching scores, and other statistical methods.
RESULTS: Patients with ARDS by pulmonary infection may be more likely to have a 
history of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, and abdominal infection was 
more likely to induce ARDS in sepsis patients with non-pulmonary infection. 
Pulmonary infections caused by Klebsiella pneumoniae and Acinetobacter baumannii 
were more likely to induce ARDS. The oxygenation index and prognosis of ARDS 
patients induced by pulmonary infection were worse than those caused by other 
infections, with lower PaO2, PaO2/FiO2, and ROX index and longer hospital stay. 
More ARDS patients with pulmonary infection were given mechanical ventilation 
therapy, with higher mortality, APACHE II, SOFA, and SAPS II. The further 
correlation analysis showed that the prognostic scores of ARDS patients were 
negatively correlated with PaO2/FiO2 and ROX index. The above results were 
confirmed to varying degrees by propensity matching scores, external cohort 
validation, and other methods.
CONCLUSION: Pulmonary infection induces a worse prognosis of ARDS than other 
site infections in patients with sepsis and ARDS. These patients require 
heightened vigilance, early intervention, and possibly more aggressive 
management strategies.

OBJECTIVES: Approximately one-third of patients with sepsis-associated acute 
kidney injury (AKI) progress to acute kidney disease (AKD) with higher 
short-term mortality. We aimed to identify the clinical characteristics that 
influence in-hospital death in sepsis-associated AKD and develop a nomogram to 
facilitate early warning.
METHODS: Logical regression was applied to screen variables based on clinical 
data from the Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care IV (MIMIC-IV) 
database. A nomogram was established to predict in-hospital death risk in 
patients with sepsis-associated AKD. The eICU Collaborative Research Database 
(eICU-CRD) was used for external validation. The receiver operating 
characteristic and calibration curves were used to determine the model's 
performance.
RESULTS: A total of 1,779 patients with sepsis-associated AKD were included from 
the MIMIC-IV and 344 from the eICU-CRD. Age, Glasgow coma scale score, systolic 
blood pressure, peripheral oxygen saturation, platelet count, white blood cell 
count, and bicarbonate levels were significantly correlated with death. The 
nomogram demonstrated high discrimination in the training (C-index, 0.829; 95% 
confidence interval [CI] [0.807-0.852]) and testing sets (C-index: 0.760; 95% CI 
[0.706-0.814]). At the optimal cut-off value of 0.270, the model's sensitivity 
in the training and validation datasets was 72.8% (95% CI [68.3-76.9%]) and 
64.5% (95% CI [54.9-73.4%]), while the specificity was 79.2% (95% CI 
[76.9-81.4%]) and 74.8% (95% CI [68.7-80.2%]), respectively.
CONCLUSION: We identified seven predictors of in-hospital death in patients with 
sepsis-associated AKD. In addition, we developed an online dynamic nomogram to 
accurately and conveniently predict short-term outcomes, which performed well in 
the external dataset.

BACKGROUND: Red blood cell distribution width (RDW) to platelet ratio (RPR) is a 
novel inflammatory indicator. It integrates the risk prediction of RDW and 
platelet, which is associated with adverse outcomes. However, the predictive 
power of RPR in mortality for patients with acute myocardial infarction (AMI) 
remains uncertain. Thus, we aimed to explore the association between RPR and 
180-day in-hospital mortality in patients with AMI.
METHODS: Data on patients with AMI were extracted from the Medical Information 
Mart for Intensive Care IV (MIMIC-IV) database. Patients were divided into two 
groups according to the optimal RPR cut-off value. The survival curve between 
high and low RPR groups was plotted via the Kaplan-Meier (KM) method. Univariate 
and multivariate Cox regression analyses were performed to determine the 
association between RPR on admission and 180-day in-hospital mortality.
RESULTS: A total of 1266 patients were enrolled, of which 83 (6.8%) died within 
180 days during the hospitalization. Compared with the survivor group, the 
non-survivor group had higher RPR on admission (0.11 ± 0.07 vs. 0.08 ± 0.06, 
P < 0.001). The KM curve indicated that the survival probability of low RPR 
group was higher than that of high RPR group. Multivariate Cox regression 
analysis demonstrated that higher RPR on admission was an independent and 
effective predictor of 180-day mortality in patients with AMI (hazard ratio 
[HR]: 2.677, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.159-6.188, P = 0.021).
CONCLUSION: Higher RPR was associated with higher in-hospital 180-day mortality 
in patients with AMI.

AIMS: This study aimed to delineate correlation between stress hyperglycemia 
ratio (SHR) and clinical outcomes among patients in the cardiac intensive care 
unit (CICU).
METHODS: Participants were categorized based on their SHR threshold values. Key 
outcomes were short-term mortality and major adverse cardiovascular events 
(MACEs) at 1-year follow-up. The association between SHR and outcomes was 
estimated using inverse probability of treatment weighting (IPTW) and 
Kaplan-Meier analyses. The C-statistic was used to gauge the predictive 
capability of SHR.
RESULTS: The study included 1,133 patients from the Medical Information Mart for 
Intensive Care IV and 412 from the Second Affiliated Hospital of Wenzhou Medical 
University. Kaplan-Meier curves revealed that individuals with elevated SHR 
exhibited higher 90-day mortality and MACEs. When considering SHR levels and 
diabetes status simultaneously, those with increased SHR but non-diabetes had 
the highest 90-day mortality and MACEs. SHR was associated with short-term 
mortality and MACEs (HRadjusted 1.63 95%CI 1.15-2.30; HRIPTW 1.47 95%CI 
1.05-2.05). Upon integrating SHR into the foundational model, the C-statistic 
was 0.821, outperforming other hyperglycemia metrics.
CONCLUSION: SHR is a valuable indicator for predicting poor outcomes in CICU 
patients. Its utility spans potential risk stratification and offers insights 
for tailoring prognostic treatments to CICU patients.

OBJECTIVE: The serum anion gap (AG) has been reported to be an important 
prognostic indicator for patients in intensive care units. To explore the 
potential relationship between the serum AG and 30-day mortality in patients who 
underwent CABG.
PATIENTS AND METHODS: All data were collected from the Medical Information Mart 
for Intensive Care Ⅳ (MIMIC-Ⅳ) database. We divided patients into 3 groups 
according to AG tertiles. The primary outcome of our study was the 30-day 
mortality of patients who underwent CABG. The relationship between the serum AG 
and mortality in individuals who underwent CABG was estimated using Cox 
proportional hazard models. Subgroup analysis for effect modification was 
conducted with a likelihood ratio test.
RESULTS: A total of 5,102 eligible subjects were included in our analysis. After 
adjusting for confounding factors, every unit increase in the AG was associated 
with a 22% higher odds of 30-day mortality in patients who underwent CABG 
[hazard ratio (HR), 95% confidence interval (CI): 1.22, 1.13-1.33] When the AG 
was converted into a categorical variable, the high AG group had a higher risk 
of 30-day mortality than the low AG group in the fully adjusted model (HR, 95% 
CI: 3.99, 1.35-11.76). Tests for trends were statistically significant (p-value 
< 0.05). Subgroup analysis demonstrated that higher mortality was related to the 
subgroups of people ≥ 70 years and females.
CONCLUSIONS: The serum AG was an independent predictor of short-term prognosis 
in patients who underwent CABG. A high AG was associated with an increased risk 
of 30-day mortality after CABG.

BACKGROUND: Gastrointestinal bleeding is a serious adverse event of coronary 
artery bypass grafting and lacks tailored risk assessment tools for personalized 
prevention.
OBJECTIVE: This study aims to develop and validate predictive models to assess 
the risk of gastrointestinal bleeding after coronary artery bypass grafting 
(GIBCG) and to guide personalized prevention.
METHODS: Participants were recruited from 4 medical centers, including a 
prospective cohort and the Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care IV 
(MIMIC-IV) database. From an initial cohort of 18,938 patients, 16,440 were 
included in the final analysis after applying the exclusion criteria. Thirty 
combinations of machine learning algorithms were compared, and the optimal model 
was selected based on integrated performance metrics, including the area under 
the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUROC) and the Brier score. This 
model was then developed into a web-based risk prediction calculator. The 
Shapley Additive Explanations method was used to provide both global and local 
explanations for the predictions.
RESULTS: The model was developed using data from 3 centers and a prospective 
cohort (n=13,399) and validated on the Drum Tower cohort (n=2745) and the MIMIC 
cohort (n=296). The optimal model, based on 15 easily accessible admission 
features, demonstrated an AUROC of 0.8482 (95% CI 0.8328-0.8618) in the 
derivation cohort. In external validation, the AUROC was 0.8513 (95% CI 
0.8221-0.8782) for the Drum Tower cohort and 0.7811 (95% CI 0.7275-0.8343) for 
the MIMIC cohort. The analysis indicated that high-risk patients identified by 
the model had a significantly increased mortality risk (odds ratio 2.98, 95% CI 
1.784-4.978; P<.001). For these high-risk populations, preoperative use of 
proton pump inhibitors was an independent protective factor against the 
occurrence of GIBCG. By contrast, dual antiplatelet therapy and oral 
anticoagulants were identified as independent risk factors. However, in low-risk 
populations, the use of proton pump inhibitors (χ21=0.13, P=.72), dual 
antiplatelet therapy (χ21=0.38, P=.54), and oral anticoagulants (χ21=0.15, 
P=.69) were not significantly associated with the occurrence of GIBCG.
CONCLUSIONS: Our machine learning model accurately identified patients at high 
risk of GIBCG, who had a poor prognosis. This approach can aid in early risk 
stratification and personalized prevention.

BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: Patients who survive sepsis in the intensive care unit 
(ICU) (sepsis survivors) have an increased risk of long-term mortality and ICU 
readmission. We aim to identify the risk factors for in-hospital mortality in 
sepsis survivors with later ICU readmission and visualize the quantitative 
relationship between the individual risk factors and mortality by applying 
machine learning (ML) algorithm.
METHODS: Data were obtained from the Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care 
III (MIMIC-III) database for sepsis and non-sepsis ICU survivors who were later 
readmitted to the ICU. The data on the first day of ICU readmission and the 
in-hospital mortality was combined for the ML algorithm modeling and the SHapley 
Additive exPlanations (SHAP) value of the correlation between the risk factors 
and the outcome.
RESULTS: Among the 2970 enrolled patients, in-hospital mortality during ICU 
readmission was significantly higher in sepsis survivors (n = 2228) than 
nonsepsis survivors (n = 742) (50.4% versus 30.7%, P<0.001). The ML algorithm 
identified 18 features that were associated with a risk of mortality in these 
groups; among these, BUN, age, weight, and minimum heart rate were shared by 
both groups, and the remaining mean systolic pressure, urine output, albumin, 
platelets, lactate, activated partial thromboplastin time (APTT), potassium, 
pCO2, pO2, respiration rate, Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) score for eye-opening, 
anion gap, sex and temperature were specific to previous sepsis survivors. The 
ML algorithm also calculated the quantitative contribution and noteworthy 
threshold of each factor to the risk of mortality in sepsis survivors.
CONCLUSION: 14 specific parameters with corresponding thresholds were found to 
be associated with the in-hospital mortality of sepsis survivors during the ICU 
readmission. The construction of advanced ML techniques could support the 
analysis and development of predictive models that can be used to support the 
decisions and treatment strategies made in a clinical setting in critical care 
patients.

BACKGROUND: There are less studies focusing on the sedative therapy of acute 
myocardial infarction (AMI) critical patients. This study aim to compare the 
impact on the prognosis of AMI critical patients of using midazolam, propofol 
and dexmedetomidine.
METHODS: We collected clinical data from the Medical Information Mart for 
Intensive Care III (MIMIC III) database. Data on 427 AMI patients with sedatives 
using were recruited from in Coronary Heart Disease Intensive Care unit (CCU).
RESULTS: There were 143 patients in midazolam using, 272 in propofol using and 
28 in dexmedetomidine using. The rate of 28-days mortality was 23.9% in overall 
patients. Through logistic regression analysis, only midazolam using was 
significant association with increased 28-days mortality when compared with 
propofol or dexmedetomidine using. In the subgroup analysis of age, gender, body 
mass index (BMI), white blood cell (WBC), beta-block, and revascularization, the 
association between midazolam using and increased 28-days mortality remained 
significantly. Through propensity score matching, 140 patients using midazolam 
and 192 using non-midazolam were successfully matched, the midazolam using 
presented with higher rate of CCU mortality, hospital mortality and 28-days 
mortality, longer of mechanical ventilation time and CCU duration. E-value 
analysis suggested robustness to unmeasured confounding.
CONCLUSION: Propofol or dexmedetomidine are preferred to be used in AMI critical 
patients for sedative therapy.

BACKGROUND: Traumatic brain injury (TBI) is a global health concern that often 
leads to poor prognosis. We designed this study to explore whether thiamine use 
is associated with a better prognosis of TBI.
METHODS: TBI patients selected from the Medical Information Mart for Intensive 
Care-III database were included in the study. Univariate and multivariate Cox 
regression analyses were performed to examine the relationship between thiamine 
use and mortality in TBI patients. Propensity score matching (PSM) was utilized 
to generate balanced cohorts of the non-thiamine use group and the thiamine use 
group. Subgroup analysis was performed in the cohort after PSM to verify the 
association between thiamine use and mortality in TBI patients across different 
stratifications.
RESULTS: The incidence of thiamine use in TBI was 18.3%. The thiamine use group 
had a lower 30-day mortality rate (p < 0.001), a longer length of ICU stay (p < 
0.001), and a longer length of hospital stay (p < 0.001) than the non-thiamine 
use group, both in the primary cohort before PSM and the cohort after PSM. A 
multivariate Cox regression analysis confirmed that thiamine use was 
independently associated with mortality (OR = 0.454, p < 0.001) after adjusting 
for confounding effects. In the cohort after PSM, the subgroup analysis showed 
that thiamine use is associated with lower mortality in TBI patients with a 
Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) score of < 13, but it is not associated with mortality 
in TBI patients whose GCS score is ≥13.
CONCLUSION: Thiamine supplementation is effective in improving the outcome of 
TBI, except in cases of mild TBI. The optimal thiamine supplementation strategy 
for TBI is worthwhile to be explored in future studies.

BACKGROUND: We attempted to determine the predictive ability of the first-day 
Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (SOFA) score in the cardiac intensive care 
unit, as well as a new score combining the anion gap (AG) with the SOFA score 
(SOFA-AG).
METHODS: Information was obtained from the Medical Information Mart for 
Intensive Care III (MIMIC III 1.4) database. We plotted the relationship between 
the maximum first-day AG and 90-day mortality after admission to the care unit. 
Patients were divided into five groups based on the hazard ratio (HR) and 
assigned scores of 0, 1, 2, 3, or 4 points. We compared the area under the curve 
(AUC) for the receiver-operating characteristic curve of the SOFA and that of 
the SOFA-AG.
RESULTS: A total of 1316 patients were identified and divided into the following 
five groups: AG 8 to <16 mmol/L; AG 16 to <17 mmol/L; AG 17 to <19 mmol/L; AG 19 
to <21 mmol/L; and AG ≥ 21 mmol/L. The SOFA-AG score had a greater AUC than the 
SOFA score at 7 days (0.770 vs. 0.711; P < 0.001), 14 days (0.751 vs. 0.692; 
P < 0.001), 28 days (0.741 vs. 0.684; P < 0.001), and 90 days (0.727 vs. 0.667; 
P < 0.001).
CONCLUSIONS: The SOFA score showed moderate predictive value only for 7-day 
mortality after admission to the cardiac intensive care unit, but the SOFA-AG 
score had improved predictive ability for up to 90 days after admission.

To investigate the predictive value of baseline platelet count and its 
short-term dynamic changes in the prognosis of patients with acute heart failure 
(AHF) in the intensive care unit. Patients diagnosed with AHF in the medical 
information mart for intensive care III and their clinical data were 
retrospectively filtered. Patients were divided into survivor and non-survivor 
groups based on their prognosis during hospitalization, and differences in 
baseline data between groups were compared. Logistic regression models and 
restricted cubic spline (RCS) plots were performed to evaluate the relationship 
between baseline platelet counts and in-hospital mortality. Changes and trends 
in platelet counts were compared between the survivor and non-survivor groups 
after adjusting for confounders with the generalized additive mixing model 
(GAMM). A total of 2930 critical patients with acute heart failure were 
included, of which 2720 were survivors and 210 were non-survivors. Multiple 
logistic regression models revealed that baseline platelet count was an 
independent factor in hospital mortality (OR 0.997, 95% CI 0.994-0.999, 
P-value = 0.018). The RCS plot demonstrated a U-shaped dose-response 
relationship between baseline platelet count and in-hospital mortality. GAMM 
analysis suggested that the platelet counts decreased and then increased in the 
survivor group and gradually decreased in the non-survivor group, with a gradual 
increase of difference between two groups. After adjusting for confounders, the 
mean daily increase was -6.014 (95% CI -7.076-4.953, P-value < 0.001). Baseline 
platelet demonstrated a U-shaped dose-response relationship with adverse 
outcomes in critical patients with AHF. Early elevation of platelet was 
correlated with higher in-hospital mortality, indicating that tracking early 
changes in platelet might help determine the short-term prognosis of critical 
patients with AHF.

BACKGROUND: Upper gastrointestinal bleeding (UGIB) is a significant cause of 
morbidity and mortality worldwide. This study investigates the use of residual 
variables and machine learning (ML) models for predicting major bleeding in 
patients with severe UGIB after their first intensive care unit (ICU) admission.
METHODS: The Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care IV and eICU databases 
were used. Conventional ML and long short-term memory models were constructed 
using pre-ICU and ICU admission day data to predict the recurrence of major 
gastrointestinal bleeding. In the models, residual data were utilized by 
subtracting the normal range from the test result. The models included eight 
algorithms. Shapley additive explanations and saliency maps were used for 
feature interpretability.
RESULTS: Twenty-five ML models were developed using data from 2604 patients. The 
light gradient-boosting machine algorithm model using pre-ICU admission residual 
data outperformed other models that used test results directly, with an AUC of 
0.96. The key factors included aspartate aminotransferase, blood urea nitrogen, 
albumin, length of ICU admission, and respiratory rate.
CONCLUSIONS: ML models using residuals improved the accuracy and 
interpretability in predicting major bleeding during ICU admission in patients 
with UGIB. These interpretable features may facilitate the early identification 
and management of high-risk patients, thereby improving hemodynamic stability 
and outcomes.

BACKGROUND: Serum lactate is associated with mortality in diverse kinds of 
patients. This study aimed to investigate whether serum lactate level may 
independently predict mortality in acute kidney injury (AKI) patients.
METHODS: A total of 4461 AKI patients were collected from the Medical 
Information Mart for Intensive Care (MIMIC III) database and followed up for 
365 days. According to serum lactate tertiles, participants were divided into 
three groups (Q1-Q3) by: Q1 ≤ 1.60 mg/dl, Q2 = 1.61-2.70 mg/dl, and 
Q3 ≥ 2.71 mg/dl. We calculated the hazard ratio (HR) and 95% confidence 
intervals (Cls) for mortality across each tertile of lactate by using the Q1 as 
reference and constructed four models to adjust for the HR of mortality.
RESULTS: Nonsurvivors had significantly higher lactate compared with patients in 
the survival group. Mortality rate gradually elevated with the increase in serum 
lactate level (Q1: 29.30%, Q2: 33.40%, Q3: 37.40%). When compared with Q1 after 
adjustment of all confounders, the HRs of Q3 still was 1.20 (95% Cl 1.05-1.37).
CONCLUSIONS: This study demonstrated that high serum lactate levels were an 
independent predictor of mortality in AKI patients.

Background: Primary pulmonary hypertension (PPH) is a life-threatening disease 
associated with increased mortality. The urea cycle pathway plays a major role 
in PPH severity and treatment response. Little is known about the association of 
the blood urea nitrogen (BUN) and PPH prognosis. Methods: Clinical data were 
extracted from the Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care III (MIMIC-III) 
database. Adult patients (≥18 years) patients with primary pulmonary 
hypertension (PPH) in the database were enrolled. Spearman correlation was used 
to analyze the association of BUN with length of hospital and intensive care 
unit (ICU) stays. The chi-square test was used to analyze the association of BUN 
with mortality rate. Survival curves were estimated using the Kaplan-Meier 
method and compared by the log-rank test. Multivariable logistic regression was 
used to identify the BUN as an independent prognostic factor of mortality. 
Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves and the area under the curve 
(AUC) were used to analyze the sensitivity and specificity for mortality. 
Results: In total, 263 patients who met the selection criteria were enrolled. 
BUN was significantly positively associated with length of hospital stay and ICU 
stay (hospital stay: ρ = 0.282, ICU stay: ρ = 0.276; all P < 0.001). Higher 
hospital, 90-day and 4-year mortality rates were observed in the higher BUN 
quartile of PPH patients (hospital: P = 0.002; 90-day: P = 0.025; 4-year: P < 
0.001). The Kaplan-Meier survival curves showed that patients in higher BUN 
quartile tended to have lower 4-year survival (Q1:7.65%, Q2: 10.71%; Q3: 14.80%, 
Q4: 16.84%; P < 0.0001). Logistic regression analyses found a significant 
association of BUN and mortality (hospital: OR = 1.05, 95% CI = 1.02-1.08, P = 
0.001; 90-day: OR = 1.02, 95% CI = 1.00-1.05, P = 0.027; 4-year: OR = 1.05, 95% 
CI = 1.02-1.08, P = 0.001). Results of ROC and AUC showed that the diagnostic 
performance of BUN for mortality was moderately good. Conclusion: BUN was 
positively correlated with the length of hospital stay and ICU stay of PPH 
patients. Higher BUN was associated with higher hospital, 90-day and 4-year 
mortality and lower 4-year survival of PPH patients. These findings indicate 
that BUN can be a novel potential prognostic predictor for PPH.

OBJECTIVE: Association between neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio (NLR) on admission 
and poor prognosis in patients with acute heart failure (AHF) has been well 
established. However, the relationship between dynamic changes in NLR and 
in-hospital mortality in AHF patients has not been studied. Our purpose was to 
determine if an early change in NLR within the first week after AHF patients was 
admitted to intensive care unit (ICU) was associated with in-hospital mortality.
METHODS: Data from the medical information mart for intensive care IV (the 
MIMIC-IV) database was analyzed. The effect of baseline NLR on in-hospital 
mortality in critical patients with AHF was evaluated utilizing smooth curve 
fitting and multivariable logistic regression analysis. Moreover, comparison of 
the dynamic change in NLR among survivors and non-survivors was performed using 
the generalized additive mixed model (GAMM).
RESULTS: There were 1169 participants who took part in the present study, 986 of 
whom were in-hospital survivors and 183 of whom were in-hospital non-survivors. 
The smooth curve fitting revealed a positive relationship between baseline NLR 
and in-hospital mortality, and multivariable logistic regression analysis 
indicated that baseline NLR was an independent risk factor for in-hospital 
mortality (OR 1.04, 95% CI 1.02,1.07, P-value = 0.001). After adjusting for 
confounders, GAMM showed that the difference in NLR between survivors and 
non-survivors grew gradually during the first week after ICU admission, and the 
difference grew by an average of 0.51 per day (β = 0.51, 95% CI 0.45-0.56, 
P-value <0.001).
CONCLUSIONS: Baseline NLR was associated with poor prognosis in critical 
patients with AHF. Early rises in NLR were linked to higher in-hospital 
mortality, which suggests that keeping track of how NLR early changes might help 
identify short-term prognosis of critical patients with AHF.

BACKGROUND: Congestive heart failure (HF) is a common condition in the intensive 
care unit (ICU). Cardiomyopathy is an important etiological factor in HF. 
However, few studies have explored the effect of cardiomyopathy on the prognosis 
of HF. This study explored the association between comorbid cardiomyopathy and 
the outcomes of critically ill patients with congestive HF.
METHODS: A retrospective cohort study was performed using data extracted from 
Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care IV (MIMIC-IV) database. All adult 
patients with the first ICU admission were enrolled as participants but those 
diagnosed with cardiomyopathy alone were excluded. The demographics, 
comorbidities, vital signs, laboratory tests, scoring systems, and treatments of 
patients were extracted to further analyze. The composite endpoints included 
in-hospital mortality, cardiac arrest, and re-admission to the ICU. The 
association between cardiomyopathy comorbidity and the composite endpoints was 
assessed using propensity-score matching (PSM) and multivariable logistic 
regression models.
RESULTS: A total of 27,901 critically ill patients were enrolled, including 
1,023 patients diagnosed with cardiomyopathy and congestive HF. The average age 
of the cohort was 64.37±17.36 years, and 58.13% of the patients were men. The 
ethnicity of patients was mainly white (64.67%). Multivariable logistic 
regression analyses found the risk of composite endpoints in patients with 
cardiomyopathy was higher than other groups [odds ratio (OR) =1.87; 95% 
confidence interval (CI): 1.62-2.15; P<0.001]. Compared to patients with 
congestive HF alone (OR =1.43; 95% CI: 1.26-1.62; P<0.001), patients with 
cardiomyopathy had a similar risk of in-hospital death (OR =1.35; 95% CI: 
1.06-1.71; P=0.014). Moreover, the risks of cardiac arrest (OR =1.53; 95% CI: 
1.01-2.34; P=0.029) and re-admission to the ICU (OR =1.74; 95% CI: 1.39-2.17; 
P<0.001) were both higher in patients with cardiomyopathy than other groups. 
After PSM, the risk of composite endpoints was still higher in patients with 
cardiomyopathy (OR =1.64; 95% CI: 1.33-2.02; P<0.001). The association was 
consistent among patients admitted to the coronary care unit (CCU) and medical 
ICU (MICU)/surgical ICU (SICU).
CONCLUSIONS: Comorbid cardiomyopathy increased the risk of composite endpoints 
in patients with congestive HF admitted to the ICU. Cardiomyopathy is related to 
the poor outcomes of critically ill patients with congestive HF.

Objective To analyze the risk factors of septic cardiomyopathy (SC),and to 
construct and evaluate the risk prediction model of SC. Methods The clinical 
data of patients with sepsis were extracted from MIMIC-Ⅳ database and randomized 
into a training set and a validation set at a ratio of 7 to 3.According to the 
presence or absence of SC,the patients were assigned into SC and non-SC 
groups.The independent risk factors of SC were determined by univariate and 
multivariate Logistic regression analysis,and a risk prediction model and a 
nomogram were established.The area under the receiver operating characteristic 
curve (AUC),calibration curve,and decision curve analysis (DCA) were employed to 
evaluate the distinguishing degree,calibration,and clinical applicability of the 
model,respectively. Results A total of 2628 sepsis patients were enrolled in 
this study,including 1865 patients in the training set and 763 patients in the 
validation set.There was no significant difference in the incidence of SC 
between the training set and the validation set (58.98% vs. 
62.25%,P=0.120).Except chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (P=0.015) and 
length of stay in intensive care unit (P=0.016),there was no significant 
difference in other clinical indicators between the two groups (all 
P>0.05).Logistic regression analysis showed that coronary heart disease 
(P=0.028),heart failure (P<0.001),increased neutrophil count (P=0.001),decreased 
lymphocyte count (P=0.036),increased creatine kinase isoenzyme (P<0.001),and 
increased blood urea nitrogen (P=0.042) were independent risk factors for SC.The 
AUC of the nomogram prediction model in the training set and validation set was 
0.759 (95% CI=0.732-0.785) and 0.765 (95% CI=0.723-0.807),respectively.The 
established model showcased good fitting degrees in both data sets (training 
set:P=0.075;validation set:P=0.067).The DCA results showed that the nomogram 
prediction model had good clinical applicability. Conclusion The nomogram 
prediction model based on basic diseases and clinical biochemical indicators can 
effectively predict the risk of SC occurrence.

BACKGROUND: This study aimed to develop and validate a model for mortality risk 
stratification of intensive care unit (ICU) patients with acute kidney injury 
(AKI) using the machine learning technique.
METHODS: Eligible data were extracted from the Medical Information Mart for 
Intensive Care (MIMIC-III) database. Calibration, discrimination, and risk 
classification for mortality prediction were evaluated using conventional 
scoring systems and the new algorithm. A 10-fold cross-validation was performed. 
The predictive models were externally validated using the eICU database and also 
patients treated at the Second People's Hospital of Shenzhen between January 
2015 to October 2018.
RESULTS: For the new model, the areas under the receiver operating 
characteristic curves (AUROCs) for mortality during hospitalization and at 28 
and 90 days after discharge were 0.91, 0.87, and 0.87, respectively, which were 
higher than for the Simplified Acute Physiology Score (SAPS II) and Sequential 
Organ Failure Assessment (SOFA). For external validation, the AUROC was 0.82 for 
in-hospital mortality, higher than SOFA, SAPS II, and Acute Physiology and 
Chronic Health Evaluation (APACHE) IV in the eICU database, but for the 28- and 
90-day mortality, the new model had AUROCs (0.79 and 0.80, respectively) similar 
to that of SAPS II in the SZ2 database. The reclassification indexes were 
superior for the new model compared with the conventional scoring systems.
CONCLUSIONS: The new risk stratification model shows high performance in 
predicting mortality in ICU patients with AKI.

OBJECTIVE: To select variables related to mortality risk of stroke patients in 
intensive care unit (ICU) through long short-term memory (LSTM) with attention 
mechanisms and Logistic regression with L1 norm, and to construct mortality risk 
prediction model based on conventional Logistic regression with important 
variables selected from the two models and to evaluate the model performance.
METHODS: Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care (MIMIC)-Ⅳ database was 
retrospectively analyzed and the patients who were primarily diagnosed with 
stroke were selected as study population. The outcome was defined as whether the 
patient died in hospital after admission. Candidate predictors included 
demogra-phic information, complications, laboratory tests and vital signs in the 
initial 48 h after ICU admission. The data were randomly divided into a training 
set and a test set for ten times at a ratio of 8 ∶2. In training sets, LSTM with 
attention mechanisms and Logistic regression with L1 norm were constructed to 
select important variables. In the test sets, the mean importance of variables 
of ten times was used as a reference to pick out the top 10 variables in each of 
the two models, and then these variables were included in conventional Logistic 
regression to build the final prediction model. Model evaluation was based on 
the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC), sensitivity, 
specificity, and accuracy. And the model performance was compared with the 
forward Logistic regression model which hadn't conducted variable selection 
previously.
RESULTS: A total of 2 755 patients with 2 979 ICU admission records were 
included in the analysis, of which 526 recorded deaths. The AUC of Logistic 
regression model with L1 norm was statistically better than that of LSTM with 
attention mechanisms (0.819±0.031 vs. 0.760±0.018, P < 0.001). Age, blood 
glucose, and blood urea nitrogen were at the top ten important variables in both 
of the two models. AUC, sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy of Logistic 
regression models were 0.85, 85.98%, 71.74% and 74.26%, respectively. And the 
final prediction model was superior to forward Logistic regression model.
CONCLUSION: The variables selected by Logistic regression with L1 norm and LSTM 
with attention mechanisms had good prediction performance, which showed 
important implications on the mortality prediction of stroke patients in ICU.

目的: 基于引入注意力机制的长短期记忆网络(long short-term 
memory，LSTM)和L1正则化的Logistic回归筛选变量，再通过传统的Logistic回归建立重症监护病房(intensive care 
unit，ICU)脑卒中患者院内死亡风险预测模型并评价模型效果。
方法: 选取重症医学信息数据库(Medical Information Mart for Intensive 
Care-Ⅳ，MIMIC-Ⅳ)中的脑卒中患者作为研究对象，以是否发生院内死亡作为结局变量，备选预测因子包括人口学特征、合并症、入院48 
h内实验室检查和生命体征检查等。将数据根据结局指标以8 
∶2的比例随机进行10次训练集和测试集的划分，在训练集上构建LSTM和L1正则化的Logistic回归模型，在测试集上选取重要程度排名前10的变量的并集纳入Logistic回归建立预测模型，以受试者工作特征曲线下面积(area 
under curve, AUC)、灵敏度、特异度、预测准确度为指标对模型进行评价，并与未预先进行变量筛选的前进法Logistic回归模型的预测效果进行比较。
结果: 共纳入2 755例脑卒中患者的2 
979条ICU入院记录，其中院内死亡记录占17.66%。两个变量筛选模型中，L1正则化的Logistic回归模型的AUC显著优于LSTM模型(0.819±0.031 
vs. 0.760±0.018, P < 
0.001)，两个模型中重要程度均位于前10的变量包括年龄、血糖和尿素氮。最终预测模型的AUC为0.85，灵敏度为85.98%，特异度为71.74%，预测准确率为74.26%，优于未预先进行变量筛选的前进法Logistic回归模型。
结论: 用引入注意力机制的LSTM和L1正则的Logistic回归筛选出的变量的预测效果较好，具有一定的临床价值。

OBJECTIVE: Prediction of disease phenotypes and their outcomes is a difficult 
task. In practice, patients routinely seek second opinions from multiple 
clinical experts for complex disease diagnosis. Our objective is to mimic such a 
practice of seeking second opinions by training 2 agents with different focuses: 
the primary agent studies the most recent visit of the patient to learn the 
current health status, and then the second-opinion agent considers the entire 
patient history to obtain a more global view.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: Our approach Dr. Agent augments recurrent neural networks 
with 2 policy gradient agents. Moreover, Dr. Agent is customized with various 
patient demographics information and learns a dynamic skip connection to focus 
on the relevant information over time. We trained Dr. Agent to perform 4 
clinical prediction tasks on the publicly available MIMIC-III (Medical 
Information Mart for Intensive Care) database: (1) in-hospital mortality 
prediction, (2) acute care phenotype classification, (3) physiologic 
decompensation prediction, and (4) forecasting length of stay. We compared the 
performance of Dr. Agent against 4 baseline clinical predictive models.
RESULTS: Dr. Agent outperforms baseline clinical prediction models across all 4 
tasks in terms of all metrics. Compared with the best baseline model, Dr. Agent 
achieves up to 15% higher area under the precision-recall curve on different 
tasks.
CONCLUSIONS: Dr. Agent can comprehensively model the long-term dependencies of 
patients' health status while considering patients' demographics using 2 agents, 
and therefore achieves better prediction performance on different clinical 
prediction tasks.

BACKGROUND: Early prognosis evaluation is crucial for decision-making in 
cardiogenic shock (CS) patients. Dynamic lactate assessment, for example, 
normalized lactate load, has been a better prognosis predictor than single 
lactate value in septic shock. Our objective was to investigate the correlation 
between normalized lactate load and in-hospital mortality in patients with CS.
METHODS: Data were extracted from the Medical Information Mart for Intensive 
Care (MIMIC)-IV database. The calculation of lactate load involved the 
determination of the cumulative area under the lactate curve, while normalized 
lactate load was computed by dividing the lactate load by the corresponding 
period. Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) curves were constructed, and the 
evaluation of areas under the curves (AUC) for various parameters was performed 
using the DeLong test.
RESULTS: Our study involved a cohort of 1932 CS patients, with 687 individuals 
(36.1%) experiencing mortality during their hospitalization. The AUC for 
normalized lactate load demonstrated significant superiority compared to the 
first lactate (0.675 vs. 0.646, P < 0.001), maximum lactate (0.675 vs. 0.651, 
P < 0.001), and mean lactate (0.675 vs. 0.669, P = 0.003). Notably, the AUC for 
normalized lactate load showed comparability to that of the Sequential Organ 
Failure Assessment (SOFA) score (0.675 vs. 0.695, P = 0.175).
CONCLUSION: The normalized lactate load was an independently associated with the 
in-hospital mortality among CS patients.

BACKGROUND: Systemic immune-inflammation index (SII) has been identified as a 
prognostic biomarker in various diseases. However, its significance in acute 
pancreatitis (AP) has not been reported. Therefore, the main aim of this study 
was to determine the association of SII with clinical outcomes of AP patients, 
after adjusting for several confounders.
METHODS: This retrospective cohort study was conducted using data retrieved from 
the Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care III database (MIMIC-III). The 
study only included patients diagnosed with AP. SII was calculated as the 
platelet counts x neutrophil counts/lymphocyte counts. Cox regression models 
were employed to assess the impact of SII on the 30- and 90-day mortality of AP 
patients. Subgroup analysis was carried out to explore the stability of the 
relationship between SII and AP mortality.
RESULTS: A total of 513 patients were found to be eligible based on the 
inclusion and exclusion criteria. For 30-day all-cause mortality, in the model 
adjusted for multiple confounders, the HR (95% CI) for mid-SII group (SII: 
75.6-104.2) and high-SII groups (SII: >104.2) were 1.29 (0.65, 2.56) and 2.57 
(1.35, 4.88), respectively, compared to the low-SII group (SII: <75.5). A 
similar trend was observed for 90-day mortality. Subgroup analyses presented a 
stable relationship between SII and 30-day all-cause mortality of AP patients.
CONCLUSION: SII is a potentially useful prognostic biomarker for AP. However, 
prospective studies are needed to confirm this finding.

BACKGROUND: Acute kidney injury (AKI) is a common and important complication in 
patients with gastrointestinal bleeding who are admitted to the intensive care 
unit. The present study proposes an artificial intelligence solution for acute 
kidney injury prediction in patients with gastrointestinal bleeding admitted to 
the intensive care unit.
METHODS: Data were collected from the eICU Collaborative Research Database 
(eICU-CRD) and Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care-IV (MIMIC-IV) 
database. The prediction model was developed using the extreme gradient boosting 
(XGBoost) model. The area under the receiver operating characteristic curve, 
accuracy, precision, area under the precision-recall curve (AUC-PR), and F1 
score were used to evaluate the predictive performance of each model.
RESULTS: Logistic regression, XGBoost, and XGBoost with severity scores were 
used to predict acute kidney injury risk using all features. The XGBoost-based 
acute kidney injury predictive models including XGBoost and XGBoost+severity 
scores model showed greater accuracy, recall, precision AUC, AUC-PR, and F1 
score compared to logistic regression.
CONCLUSION: The XGBoost model obtained better risk prediction for acute kidney 
injury in patients with gastrointestinal bleeding admitted to the intensive care 
unit than the traditional logistic regression model, suggesting that machine 
learning (ML) techniques have the potential to improve the development and 
validation of predictive models in patients with gastrointestinal bleeding 
admitted to the intensive care unit.

The fibrosis-4 score is a marker of liver fibrosis and has been confirmed to be 
associated with the prognosis of various diseases. There is no study exploring 
the prognostic value of the fibrosis-4 score in traumatic brain injury (TBI) 
patients. We design this study to explore the association between the fibrosis-4 
score and mortality from TBI. TBI patients from the Medical Information Mart for 
Intensive Care-III database were extracted for the study. Univariate and 
multivariate logistic regressions were sequentially performed to analyze the 
association between fibrosis-4 and mortality in TBI. The area under the receiver 
operating characteristic curve (AUC) was drawn to evaluate the prognostic value 
of fibrosis-4 and other scores. A total of 1018 TBI patients were included, with 
a 30-day mortality of 24.2%. Non-survivors had older age, lower Glasgow Coma 
Scale (GCS), and higher injury severity score (ISS) than survivors. The 
aspartate aminotransferase platelet ratio index (APRI) and fibrosis-4 score were 
significantly higher in non-survivors. Univariate logistic regression showed 
that age, GCS, ISS, white blood cell, hemoglobin, fibrosis-4 score, subarachnoid 
hemorrhage, and anticoagulants were associated with the mortality of TBI 
patients. Multivariate logistic regression presented that age, GCS, ISS, 
fibrosis-4 score, subarachnoid hemorrhage, and anticoagulants were independent 
risk factors of mortality in TBI patients after adjusting for confounding 
effects. The AUC of the GCS, ISS, APRI, and fibrosis-4 score for predicting 
mortality was 0.711, 0.625, 0.592, and 0.627, respectively. Composed of age, 
GCS, ISS, fibrosis-4 score, subarachnoid hemorrhage, and anticoagulants, the 
predictive model had the highest AUC value of 0.790. The fibrosis-4 score is an 
independent risk factor for mortality in TBI. The model incorporating fibrosis-4 
performs well in predicting the prognosis of TBI patients.

BACKGROUND: We aimed to identify the affecting features of persistent acute 
kidney injury (pAKI) for patients in intensive care units (ICU).
METHODS: The Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care IV (MIMIC-IV) database 
and eICU Collaborative Research Database (eICU-CRD) were used to identify AKI 
patients with and without duration of more than 48 hours. Least absolute 
shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) regression and support vector machine 
(SVM-RFE) were utilized to screen for the significant clinical indexes 
associated with pAKI. Predictive nomogram was created based on the above 
informative parameters to predict the probability of pAKI.
RESULTS: LASSO regression and SVM-RFE revealed that serum albumin, chronic 
kidney disease, AKI stage, sequential organ failure assessment score, lactate 
and renal replacement therapy during the first day were significantly associated 
with pAKI in the training cohort. The predictive nomogram based on the six 
predictors exhibited good predictive performance as calculated by C-index 0.730 
(95% CI 0.710-0.749) in the training group, 0.702 (95% CI 0.672-0.722) in the 
internal validation set and 0.704 (0.677-0.731) in the external validation 
cohort for the prediction of pAKI. Moreover, the predictive nomogram exhibited 
not only encouraging calibration ability, but also great clinical utility in the 
training group, in the internal validation group as well as in the external 
validation cohort.
CONCLUSION: Serum albumin, CKD, AKI stage, SOFA score, lactate, RRT during the 
first day were closely associated with pAKI in patients in ICU. The predictive 
nomogram for pAKI manifested good predictive ability for the identification of 
ICU patients with pAKI.

BACKGROUND: Red blood cell distribution width (RDW) to albumin ratio (RAR) is 
associated with poor prognosis in diabetic comorbidities and cancer. However, 
the association between RAR and prognosis in patients with sepsis remains 
unclear, which was investigated in this study.
METHODS: We conducted a retrospective cohort study based on the Medical 
Information Mart for Intensive Care (MIMIC) IV version 2.0 database. The primary 
outcome of this study was 28-day mortality. Secondary outcomes included 90-day 
mortality, in-hospital mortality, length of hospital stay, and length of 
intensive care unit (ICU) stay. Multivariate regression analysis and subgroup 
analysis were performed to investigate the association between RAR and prognosis 
in patients with sepsis.
RESULTS: A total of 14,639 participants were included in this study. The mean 
age of the participants was 65.2 ± 16.3 years and the mean RAR was 5.5 ± 1.9 % 
/g/dl. For 28-day mortality, after adjusting for covariates, HRs [95% confidence 
intervals (CIs)] for tertiles 2 (4.4-5.8) and 3 (RAR > 5.8) were 1.33 (1.20, 
1.46) and 1.98 (1.79, 2.19), respectively. Similar results were observed for 
90-day mortality and in-hospital mortality. According to Kaplan-Meier curve 
analysis, the higher RAR group had higher 28-day mortality and 90-day mortality.
CONCLUSION: Our study shows that RAR is significantly associated with poor 
clinical prognosis in sepsis. The higher the RAR, the higher the 28-day, 90-day, 
and in-hospital mortality.

Acute kidney injury (AKI) is one of the most severe consequences of kidney 
injury, and it will also cause or aggravate the complications by the fast 
decline of kidney excretory function. Accurate AKI prediction, including the AKI 
case, AKI stage, and AKI onset time interval, can provide adequate support for 
effective interventions. Besides, discovering how the medical features affect 
the AKI result may also provide supporting information for disease treatment. An 
attention-based temporal neural network approach was employed in this study for 
AKI prediction and for the analysis of the impact of medical features from 
temporal electronic health record (EHR) data of patients before AKI diagnosis. 
We used the publicly available dataset provided by the Medical Information Mart 
for Intensive Care (MIMIC) for model training, validation, and testing, and then 
the model was applied in clinical practice. The improvement of AKI case 
prediction is around 5% AUC (area under the receiver operating characteristic 
curve), and the AUC value of AKI stage prediction on AKI stage 3 is over 82%. We 
also analyzed the data by two steps: the associations between the medical 
features and the AKI case (positive or inverse) and the extent of the impact of 
medical features on AKI prediction result. It shows that features, such as 
lactate, glucose, creatinine, blood urea nitrogen (BUN), prothrombin time (PT), 
and partial thromboplastin time (PTT), are positively associated with the AKI 
case, while there are inverse associations between the AKI case and features 
such as platelet, hemoglobin, hematocrit, urine, and international normalized 
ratio (INR). The laboratory test features such as urine, glucose, creatinine, 
sodium, and blood urea nitrogen and the medication features such as nonsteroidal 
anti-inflammatory drugs, agents acting on the renin-angiotensin system, and 
lipid-lowering medication were detected to have higher weights than other 
features in the proposed model, which may imply that these features have a great 
impact on the AKI case.

The association between red blood cell distribution width (RDW) and in-hospital 
mortality in intensive care patients with acute pancreatitis (AP) is 
inconclusive. We extracted the baseline data, Bedside Index for Severity in 
Acute Pancreatitis (BISAP) score, Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (SOFA) 
score, and in-hospital prognosis of intensive care patients with AP from the 
Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care IV database. Performing binary 
logistic regression analysis to determine whether RDW is an independent risk 
factor for in-hospital mortality. By drawing receiver operating characteristic 
(ROC) curves and comparing the areas under the ROC curves (AUC) to determine the 
predictive value of RDW for in-hospital mortality, and by conducting survival 
analysis to evaluate the impact of RDW on survival time in hospital. Before and 
after the propensity score matching (PSM) analysis, RDW was always a risk factor 
for in-hospital mortality in patients with AP. The AUC of RDW was comparable to 
BISAP, while the AUCs of combining RDW and BISAP or SOFA were greater than that 
of BISAP or SOFA alone. The median survival time of the high-RDW group 
(RDW > 15.37%, before PSM; RDW > 15.35%, after PSM) was shorter than that of the 
low-RDW group. Compared with the low-RDW group, the hazard ratios of the 
high-RDW group were 3.0708 (before PSM) and 1.4197 (after PSM). RDW is an 
independent risk factor for in-hospital mortality in patients with AP. The 
predictive value of RDW for in-hospital mortality of patients with AP is 
comparable to BISAP, and the combination of RDW and BISAP or SOFA scoring system 
can improve the predictive performance to a certain extent.

BACKGROUND: Sepsis is a complex condition with high morbidity and mortality. 
Prompt treatment can improve survival, but for survivors the risk of 
deterioration and readmission remains high. Little is known about the 
association between discharge setting and readmission among sepsis survivors.
OBJECTIVE: To examine 30-day hospital readmission rates in adult sepsis 
survivors by the type of setting to which patients were discharged.
METHODS: The Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care database was used to 
identify adult sepsis survivors and evaluate 30-day readmission by discharge 
setting. A χ2 contingency analysis was used with each factor and 
presence/absence of readmission. The Kruskal-Wallis test was used to compare 
readmissions across discharge settings.
RESULTS: From our sample (N = 7107; mean age 66.5 years; 46.2% women), 23.6% (n 
= 1674) were readmitted within 30 days and of those readmitted, 30% were 
readmitted between 1 and 3 times. Discharge setting (P < .001) and age (P = .02) 
were significantly associated with readmission, but sex, ethnicity, and 
insurance type were not. High numbers of readmissions were seen in patients 
discharged to skilled nursing facilities (29.6%), home health care (26.9%), and 
home (15.0%). Similar high comorbidity burden and acuteness of illness were seen 
in patients discharged to these settings.
CONCLUSIONS: Sepsis survivors discharged to skilled nursing facilities, home 
health care, and home are at high risk for 30-day readmission. The rates of 
readmission from home health care and home settings were alarming. Often 
patients are discharged to inappropriate settings, placing them at risk for 
residual sepsis and readmission. Future research should focus on appropriate 
timing of hospital discharge and transition to the most appropriate discharge 
setting.

BACKGROUND: Early prediction of hospital mortality is crucial for ICU patients 
with sepsis. This study aimed to develop a novel blending machine learning (ML) 
model for hospital mortality prediction in ICU patients with sepsis.
METHODS: Two ICU databases were employed: eICU Collaborative Research Database 
(eICU-CRD) and Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care III (MIMIC-III). All 
adult patients who fulfilled Sepsis-3 criteria were identified. Samples from 
eICU-CRD constituted training set and samples from MIMIC-III constituted test 
set. Stepwise logistic regression model was used for predictor selection. 
Blending ML model which integrated nine sorts of basic ML models was developed 
for hospital mortality prediction in ICU patients with sepsis. Model performance 
was evaluated by various measures related to discrimination or calibration.
RESULTS: Twelve thousand five hundred fifty-eight patients from eICU-CRD were 
included as the training set, and 12,095 patients from MIMIC-III were included 
as the test set. Both the training set and the test set showed a hospital 
mortality of 17.9%. Maximum and minimum lactate, maximum and minimum albumin, 
minimum PaO2/FiO2 and age were important predictors identified by both random 
forest and extreme gradient boosting algorithm. Blending ML models based on 
corresponding set of predictors presented better discrimination than SAPS II 
(AUROC, 0.806 vs. 0.771; AUPRC 0.515 vs. 0.429) and SOFA (AUROC, 0.742 vs. 
0.706; AUPRC 0.428 vs. 0.381) on the test set. In addition, calibration curves 
showed that blending ML models had better calibration than SAPS II.
CONCLUSIONS: The blending ML model is capable of integrating different sorts of 
basic ML models efficiently, and outperforms conventional severity scores in 
predicting hospital mortality among septic patients in ICU.

BACKGROUND: Mechanical ventilation (MV) is often applied in critically ill 
patients in intensive care unit (ICU) to protect the airway from aspiration, and 
supplement more oxygen. MV may result in ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) 
in ICU patients. This study was to estimate the 90-day and 180-day mortalities 
of ICU patients with VAP, and to explore the influence of VAP on the outcomes of 
ICU patients.
METHODS: Totally, 8182 patients who aged ≥18 years and received mechanical 
ventilation (MV) in ICU from Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care III 
(MIMIC III) database were involved in this study. All subjects were divided into 
the VAP group (n = 537) and the non-VAP group (n = 7626) based on the occurrence 
of VAP. Clinical data of all participants were collected. The effect of VAP on 
the prognosis of ICU patients was explored by binary logistic regression 
analysis.
RESULTS: The results delineated that the 90-day mortality of VAP patients in ICU 
was 33.33% and 180-day mortality was 37.62%. The 90-day and 180-day mortality 
rates were higher in the VAP group than in the non-VAP group. After adjusting 
the confounders including age, ethnicity, heart failure, septicemia, simplified 
acute physiology score II (SAPSII) score, sequential organ failure assessment 
(SOFA) score, serum lactate, white blood cell (WBC), length of ICU stay, length 
of hospital stay, length of ventilation, antibiotic treatment, Pseudomonas 
aeruginosa (P.aeruginosa), methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), 
other pathogens, the risk of 90-day and 180-day mortalities in VAP patients were 
1.465 times (OR = 1.465, 95%CI: 1.188-1.807, P < 0.001) and 1.635 times 
(OR = 1.635, 95%CI: 1.333-2.005, P < 0.001) higher than those in non-VAP 
patients, respectively.
CONCLUSIONS: Our study revealed that ICU patients with VAP had poorer prognosis 
than those without VAP. The results of this study might offer a deeper insight 
into preventing the occurrence of VAP.

The association between blood urea nitrogen (BUN) and prognosis has been the 
focus of recent research. Therefore, the objective of this study was to 
investigate the association between BUN and hospital mortality in critically ill 
patients with cardiogenic shock (CS). This was a retrospective cohort study, in 
which data were obtained from the Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care 
III V1.4 database. Data from 697 patients with CS were analyzed. Logistic 
regression and subgroup analyses were used to assess the association between BUN 
and hospital mortality in patients with CS. The average age of the 697 
participants was 71.14 years, and approximately 42.18% were men. In the 
multivariate logistic regression model, after adjusting for age, sex, diabetes, 
cardiac arrhythmias, urine output, simplified acute physiology score II, 
sequential organ failure assessment, creatinine, anion gap, and heart rate, high 
BUN demonstrated strong associations with increased in-hospital mortality (per 
standard deviation increase: odds ratio [OR] 1.47, 95% confidence interval [CI] 
1.13-1.92). A similar result was observed in BUN tertile groups (BUN 23-37 mg/dL 
versus 6-22 mg/dL: OR [95% CI], 1.42 [0.86-2.34]; BUN 38-165 mg/dL versus 
6-22 mg/dL: OR [95% CI], 1.99 [1.10-3.62]; P trend 0.0272). Subgroup analysis 
did not reveal any significant interactions among various subgroups, and higher 
BUN was associated with adverse clinical outcomes in patients with CS.

PURPOSE: The present study aimed to develop a nomogram to predict the prognosis 
of patients with secondary bone tumors in the intensive care unit to facilitate 
risk stratification and treatment planning.
METHODS: We used the MIMIC IV 2.0 (the Medical Information Mart for Intensive 
Care IV) to retrieve patients with secondary bone tumors as a study cohort. To 
evaluate the predictive ability of each characteristic on patient mortality, 
stepwise Cox regression was used to screen variables, and the selected variables 
were included in the final Cox proportional hazard model. Finally, the 
performance of the model was tested using the decision curve, calibration curve, 
and receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve.
RESULTS: A total of 1028 patients were enrolled after excluding cases with 
missing information. In the training cohort, albumin, APSIII (Acute Physiology 
Score III), chemotherapy, lactate, chloride, hepatic metastases, respiratory 
failure, SAPSII (Simplified Acute Physiology Score II), and total protein were 
identified as independent risk factors for patient death and then incorporated 
into the final model. The model showed good and robust prediction performance.
CONCLUSION: We developed a nomogram prognostic model for patients with secondary 
bone tumors in the intensive care unit, which provides effective survival 
prediction information.

The purpose of this retrospective study was to assess whether mortality 
following a hip fracture can be predicted by a machine learning model trained on 
basic blood and lab test data as well as basic demographic data. Additionally, 
the purpose was to identify the key variables most associated with 1-, 5-, and 
10-year mortality and investigate their clinical significance. Input data 
included 3751 hip fracture patient records sourced from the Medical Information 
Mart for Intensive Care IV database, which provided records from in-hospital 
database systems at the Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center. The 1-year 
mortality rate for all patients studied was 21% and for those aged 80+ was 29%. 
We assessed 10 different machine learning classification models, finding 
LightGBM to have the strongest 1-year mortality prediction performance, with 
accuracy of 81%, AUC of 0.79, sensitivity of 0.34, and specificity of 0.98 on 
the test set. The strongest-weighted features of the 1-year model included age, 
glucose, red blood cell distribution width, mean corpuscular hemoglobin 
concentration, white blood cells, urea nitrogen, prothrombin time, platelet 
count, calcium levels, and partial thromboplastin time. Most of these were also 
in the top 10 features of the LightGBM 5- and 10-year prediction models trained. 
Testing for these high-ranking biomarkers in new hip fracture patients can aid 
clinicians in assessing the likelihood of poor outcomes for hip fracture 
patients, and additional research can use these biomarkers to develop a 
mortality risk score.

BACKGROUND: Intensive care unit (ICU) resources are inadequate for the large 
population in China, so it is essential for physicians to evaluate the condition 
of patients at admission. In this study, our objective was to construct a 
machine-learning risk prediction model for mortality in respiratory intensive 
care units (RICUs).
METHODS: This study involved 817 patients who made 1,063 visits and who were 
admitted to the RICU from 2012 to 2017. Potential predictors such as demographic 
information, laboratory results, vital signs and clinical characteristics were 
considered. We constructed eXtreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost) models and 
compared performances with random forest models, logistic regression models and 
clinical scores such as Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation II 
(APACHE II) and the sequential organ failure assessment (SOFA) system. The model 
was externally validated using data from Medical Information Mart for Intensive 
Care (MIMIC-III) database. A web-based calculator was developed for practical 
use.
RESULTS: Among the 1,063 visits, the RICU mortality rate was 13.5%. The XGBoost 
model achieved the best performance with the area under the receiver operating 
characteristics curve (AUROC) of 0.860 (95% confidence interval (CI): 0.808 - 
0.909) in the test set, which was significantly greater than APACHE II (0.749, 
95% CI: 0.674 - 0.820; P = 0.015) and SOFA (0.751, 95% CI: 0.669 - 0.818; P = 
0.018). The Hosmer-Lemeshow test indicated a good calibration of our predictive 
model in the test set with a P-value of 0.176. In the external validation 
dataset, the AUROC of XGBoost model was 0.779 (95% CI: 0.714 - 0.813). The final 
model contained variables that were previously known to be associated with 
mortality, but it also included some features absent from the clinical scores. 
The mean N-terminal pro-B-type natriuretic peptide (NTproBNP) of survivors was 
significantly lower than that of the non-survival group (2066.43 pg/mL vs. 
8232.81 pg/mL; P < 0.001).
CONCLUSIONS: Our results showed that the XGBoost model could be a suitable model 
for predicting RICU mortality with easy-to-collect variables at admission and 
help intensivists improve clinical decision-making for RICU patients. We found 
that higher NT-proBNP can be a good indicator of poor prognosis.

Background: The use of MV can easily lead to VAP especially in ICU patients. 
SUP, sedatives, statin and insulin have been proved to prevent VAP and improve 
the prognosis of patients. Our aim was to analyze the effects of SUP, sedative, 
statin, and insulin on patients with MV. Methods: The occurrence of VAP and 
death in MV patients and VAP patients were explored by multivariate logistic 
regression and Cox regression to analyze analyses. Results: Totally, 5277 cases 
who received MV in ICU from MIMIC IV database were included. There were 826 
(15.7%) cases in VAP-group and 4451 (84.3%) cases in non-VAP group and there 
were 1914 (36.3%) cases in hospital mortalities altogether. No protective effect 
of drugs on VAP was found in MV patients. The risk of death was 1.43 times 
higher in MV patients taking midazolam than in propofol (aHR = 1.43 95% CI: 
1.04,1.97). No protective effect of drugs on death was found in VAP patients. 
Conclusion: Compared with midazolam, propofol is more recommended as sedation 
regimen in ICU patients with MV. Further high-quality studies are needed to 
confirm this finding.

BACKGROUND: The estimated pulse wave velocity (ePWV) is a recently developed, 
simple and useful tool to measure arterial stiffness and to predict long-term 
cardiovascular mortality. However, the association of ePWV with mortality risk 
in patients with subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH) is unclear. Herein, this study 
aims to assess the potential prediction value of ePWV on short- and long-term 
mortality of SAH patients.
METHODS: Data of adult patients with no traumatic SAH were extracted from the 
Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care (MIMIC) III and IV database in this 
retrospective cohort study. Weighted univariate and multivariable Cox regression 
analyses were used to explore the associations of ePWV levels with 30-day 
mortality and 1-year mortality in SAH patients. The evaluation indexes were 
hazard ratios (HRs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs). In addition, subgroup 
analyses of age, the sequential organ failure assessment (SOFA) score, surgery, 
atrial fibrillation (AF), renal failure (RF), hepatic diseases, chronic 
obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), sepsis, hypertension, and diabetes 
mellitus (DM) were also performed.
RESULTS: Among 1,481 eligible patients, 339 died within 30 days and 435 died 
within 1 year. After adjusting for covariates, ePWV ≥ 12.10 was associated with 
higher risk of both 30-day mortality (HR = 1.77, 95%CI: 1.17-2.67) and 1-year 
mortality (HR = 1.97, 95%CI: 1.36-2.85), compared to ePWV < 10.12. The receiver 
operator characteristic (ROC) curves showed that compared to single SOFA score, 
ePWV combined with SOFA score had a relative superior predictive performance on 
both 30-day mortality and 1-year mortality, with the area under the curves 
(AUCs) of 0.740 vs. 0.664 and 0.754 vs. 0.658. This positive relationship 
between ePWV and mortality risk was also found in age ≥ 65 years old, SOFA 
score < 2, non-surgery, non-hepatic diseases, non-COPD, non-hypertension, 
non-DM, and sepsis subgroups.
CONCLUSION: Baseline ePWV level may have potential prediction value on short- 
and long-term mortality in SAH patients. However, the application of ePWV in SAH 
prognosis needs further clarification.

BACKGROUND: Sepsis is an important public health issue, and it is urgent to 
develop valuable indicators to predict the prognosis of sepsis. Our study aims 
to assess the predictive value of ICU admission (Neutrophil + 
Monocyte)/lymphocyte ratio (NMLR) on the 30-day mortality of sepsis patients.
METHODS: A retrospective analysis was conducted in septic patients, and the data 
were collected from Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care IV (MIMIC-IV). 
Univariate and multivariate Cox regression analyses were conducted to 
investigate the relation between ICU admission NMLR and 30-day mortality. 
Restricted cubic spline (RCS) was performed to determine the optimum cut-off 
value of ICU admission NMLR. Survival outcomes of the two groups with different 
ICU admission NMLR levels were estimated using the Kaplan-Meier method and 
compared by the log-rank test.
RESULTS: Finally, 7292 patients were recruited in the study, of which 1601 died 
within 30 days of discharge. The non-survival group had higher ICU admission 
NMLR values than patients in the survival group (12.24 [6.44-23.67] vs. 8.71 
[4.81-16.26], P < 0.001). Univariate and multivariate Cox regression analysis 
demonstrated that ICU admission NMLR was an independent prognostic predictor on 
30-day mortality (Univariate: P < 0.001; multivariate: P=0.011). The RCS model 
demonstrated the upturn and non-linear relationship between ICU admission NMLR 
and 30-day mortality (Nonlinearity: P=0.0124). According to the KM curve 
analysis,30-day survival was worse in the higher ICU admission NMLR group than 
that in the lower ICU admission NMLR group (Log rank test, P<0.0001).
CONCLUSION: The elevated ICU admission NMLR level is an independent risk factor 
for high 30-day mortality in patients with sepsis.

PURPOSE: The available nomograms used to predict acute pancreatitis (AP) are not 
comprehensive. We sought to investigate the effect of red blood cell 
distribution width (RDW)-albumin ratio (RA) on prognosis of patients with AP and 
develop a new nomogram to identify AP patients at high risk for mortality.
METHODS: We used data from the Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care IV 
version 2.0 (MIMIC-IV v2.0). A total of 487 patients with acute pancreatitis 
were included. Patients enrolled in the study were randomly assigned to the 
training set and validation set at a 7 : 3 ratio. According to the 30-day 
mortality rate, the data were divided into a survival group and a death group. 
Multivariate logistic regression was used to establish a prognostic nomogram for 
predicting the 30-day mortality in AP patients. The area under the receiver 
operating characteristic curve (AUC), calibration curve, the net 
reclassification improvement (NRI), the integrated discrimination improvement 
(IDI), and a decision curve analysis (DCA) are used to verify the overall 
performance of the model.
RESULTS: Among 487 patients, 54 patients died (11.1%). 338 patients were 
assigned to the training cohort and 149 were assigned to the validation cohort. 
The multivariate analysis results showed that RA, age, heart rate, temperature, 
AST/ALT, BUN, hemoglobin, potassium, and bilirubin were independent risk 
factors. The prediction performance of the newly established nomogram was better 
than those of other common scoring systems (including SOFA, OASIS, and APSIII). 
The nomogram suggests that RA (OR = 1.706, 95% CI: 1.367-2.185) is the most 
significant laboratory test indicator influencing prognosis.
CONCLUSION: The new nomogram incorporating RA performed well in predicting AP 
short-term mortality. A prospective study with a larger sample is needed to 
validate our findings.

Objective: The aim of the study is to explore the impact of early serum 
phosphate levels on the prognosis of critically ill patients with sepsis. 
Methods: In this retrospective large cohort study, data of patients with sepsis 
were obtained from the Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care IV database. 
Patients were retrospectively divided into a control group and three study 
groups according to their daily serum phosphate levels within 2 days of 
intensive care unit (ICU) admission. A Cox regression model was used to evaluate 
the association between serum phosphate levels and 28-day morbidity. Results: 
This study included 9,691 patients diagnosed with sepsis. During the first 2 
days of ICU admission, patients with hyperphosphatemia in either of the 2 days 
had higher 28-day mortality, while patients in the hypophosphatemia group had 
lower 28-day mortality (first day, 32.9% vs. 16.3%; second day, 36.3% vs. 
14.7%). After adjusting for potential confounders, hyperphosphatemia was 
significantly associated with 28-day mortality; however, only hypophosphatemia 
on the second day was independently associated with reduced 28-day mortality. 
After stratification in the hypophosphatemia group, subgroup analysis showed 
that only the association between the mild hypophosphatemia group and 28-day 
mortality reached statistical significance (hazard ratio = 0.76, 95% CI = 
0.65-0.89, P = 0.001). Conclusions: Mild hypophosphatemia might improve the 
short-term prognosis of patients with sepsis, and hyperphosphatemia is an 
independent risk factor for the outcomes of septic patients. After ICU 
admission, the serum phosphate levels on the second day had a better independent 
correlation with 28-day mortality, which prompted us to reconsider the optimal 
timing of phosphate evaluation.

BACKGROUND: Prognostication is an essential tool for risk adjustment and 
decision making in the intensive care units (ICUs). In order to improve patient 
outcomes, we have been trying to develop a more effective model than Acute 
Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation (APACHE) II to measure the severity of 
the patients in ICUs. The aim of the present study was to provide a mortality 
prediction model for ICUs patients, and to assess its performance relative to 
prediction based on the APACHE II scoring system.
METHODS: We used the Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care version III 
(MIMIC-III) database to build our model. After comparing the APACHE II with 6 
typical machine learning (ML) methods, the best performing model was screened 
for external validation on anther independent dataset. Performance measures were 
calculated using cross-validation to avoid making biased assessments. The 
primary outcome was hospital mortality. Finally, we used TreeSHAP algorithm to 
explain the variable relationships in the extreme gradient boosting algorithm 
(XGBoost) model.
RESULTS: We picked out 14 variables with 24,777 cases to form our basic data 
set. When the variables were the same as those contained in the APACHE II, the 
accuracy of XGBoost (accuracy: 0.858) was higher than that of APACHE II 
(accuracy: 0.742) and other algorithms. In addition, it exhibited better 
calibration properties than other methods, the result in the area under the ROC 
curve (AUC: 0.76). we then expand the variable set by adding five new variables 
to improve the performance of our model. The accuracy, precision, recall, F1, 
and AUC of the XGBoost model increased, and were still higher than other models 
(0.866, 0.853, 0.870, 0.845, and 0.81, respectively). On the external validation 
dataset, the AUC was 0.79 and calibration properties were good.
CONCLUSIONS: As compared to conventional severity scores APACHE II, our XGBoost 
proposal offers improved performance for predicting hospital mortality in ICUs 
patients. Furthermore, the TreeSHAP can help to enhance the understanding of our 
model by providing detailed insights into the impact of different features on 
the disease risk. In sum, our model could help clinicians determine prognosis 
and improve patient outcomes.

OBJECTIVES: To evaluate whether early intensive care transthoracic 
echocardiography (TTE) can improve the prognosis of patients with mechanical 
ventilation (MV).
DESIGN: A retrospective cohort study.
SETTING: Patients undergoing MV for more than 48 hours, based on the Medical 
Information Mart for Intensive Care III (MIMIC-III) database and the eICU 
Collaborative Research Database (eICU-CRD), were selected.
PARTICIPANTS: 2931 and 6236 patients were recruited from the MIMIC-III database 
and the eICU database, respectively.
PRIMARY AND SECONDARY OUTCOME MEASURES: The primary outcome was in-hospital 
mortality. Secondary outcomes were 30-day mortality from the date of ICU 
admission, days free of MV and vasopressors 30 days after ICU admission, use of 
vasoactive drugs, total intravenous fluid and ventilator settings during the 
first day of MV.
RESULTS: We used propensity score matching to analyse the association between 
early TTE and in-hospital mortality and sensitivity analysis, including the 
inverse probability weighting model and covariate balancing propensity score 
model, to ensure the robustness of our findings. The adjusted OR showed a 
favourable effect between the early TTE group and in-hospital mortality (MIMIC: 
OR 0.78; 95% CI 0.65 to 0.94, p=0.01; eICU-CRD: OR 0.76; 95% CI 0.67 to 0.86, 
p<0.01). Early TTE was also associated with 30-day mortality in the MIMIC 
database (OR 0.71, 95% CI 0.57 to 0.88, p=0.001). Furthermore, those who had 
early TTE had both more ventilation-free days (only in eICU-CRD: 23.48 vs 24.57, 
p<0.01) and more vasopressor-free days (MIMIC: 18.22 vs 20.64, p=0.005; 
eICU-CRD: 27.37 vs 28.59, p<0.001) than the control group (TTE applied outside 
of the early TTE and no TTE at all).
CONCLUSIONS: Early application of critical care TTE during MV is beneficial for 
improving in-hospital mortality. Further investigation with prospectively 
collected data is required to validate this relationship.

In intensive care unit (ICU), it is essential to predict the mortality of 
patients and mathematical models aid in improving the prognosis accuracy. 
Recently, recurrent neural network (RNN), especially long short-term memory 
(LSTM) network, showed advantages in sequential modeling and was promising for 
clinical prediction. However, ICU data are highly complex due to the diverse 
patterns of diseases; therefore, instead of single LSTM model, an ensemble 
algorithm of LSTM (eLSTM) is proposed, utilizing the superiority of the ensemble 
framework to handle the diversity of clinical data. The eLSTM algorithm was 
evaluated by the acknowledged database of ICU admissions Medical Information 
Mart for Intensive Care III (MIMIC-III). The investigation in total of 18415 
cases shows that compared with clinical scoring systems SAPS II, SOFA, and 
APACHE II, random forests classification algorithm, and the single LSTM 
classifier, the eLSTM model achieved the superior performance with the largest 
value of area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUROC) of 
0.8451 and the largest area under the precision-recall curve (AUPRC) of 0.4862. 
Furthermore, it offered an early prognosis of ICU patients. The results 
demonstrate that the eLSTM is capable of dynamically predicting the mortality of 
patients in complex clinical situations.

BACKGROUND: Based on the high prevalence and fatality rates associated with 
severe community-acquired pneumonia (SCAP), this study endeavored to construct 
an innovative nomogram for early identification of individuals at high risk of 
all-cause death within a 30-day period among SCAP patients receiving intensive 
care units (ICU) treatment.
METHODS: In this single-center, retrospective study, 718 SCAP patients were 
screened from the Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care IV (MIMIC-IV) 
database for the development of a predictive model. A total of 97 patients 
eligible for inclusion were included from Chongqing General Hospital, China 
between January 2020 and July 2023 for external validation. Clinical data and 
short-term prognosis were collected. Risk factors were determined using the 
least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) and multiple logistic 
regression analysis. The model's performance was evaluated through area under 
the curve (AUC), calibration curve, and decision curve analysis (DCA).
RESULTS: Eight risk predictors, including age, presence of malignant cancer, 
heart rate, mean arterial pressure, albumin, blood urea nitrogen, prothrombin 
time, and lactate levels were adopted in a nomogram. The nomogram exhibited high 
predictive accuracy, with an AUC of 0.803 (95% CI: 0.756-0.845) in the training 
set, 0.756 (95% CI: 0.693-0.816) in the internal validation set, 0.778 (95% CI: 
0.594-0.893) in the external validation set concerning 30-day mortality. 
Meanwhile, the nomogram demonstrated effective calibration through well-fitted 
calibration curves. DCA confirmed the clinical application value of the 
nomogram.
CONCLUSION: This simple and reliable nomogram can help physicians assess the 
short-term prognosis of patients with SCAP quickly and effectively, and could 
potentially be adopted widely in clinical settings after more external 
validations.

PURPOSE: We aimed to evaluate the predictive ability of an integrated score 
based on several inflammatory indices of acute kidney injury (AKI) in patients 
in the intensive care unit (ICU).
PATIENTS AND METHODS: In this observational study, 2555 patients from the 
Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care III database were randomly assigned 
to the test set (n=1599) and internal validation set (n=656). Moreover, 412 
coronary care unit patients from Zhongnan Hospital, Wuhan University were also 
included in the external validation set. The AKI-specific inflammatory index 
(ASII) was created using various inflammatory indices significantly associated 
with AKI. We further developed and validated two nomograms based on the ASII and 
other informative clinical features of AKI and prognosis.
RESULTS: The ASII was calculated as 2.317×MLR+0.417×GPS+0.007×ALRI. In the 
training set, patients with a high ASII had a higher risk of incident AKI (odds 
ratio [OR], 5.33; 95% confidence index [CI], 3.60-7.88; P<0.001) than those with 
a low ASII with or without pre-existing chronic kidney disease. The nomograms 
for AKI and prognosis based on the ASII and other significant clinical 
characteristics had high predictive value in the prediction of AKI and prognosis 
in patients in the ICU. Moreover, the results in the internal validation set and 
in the external validation cohort were almost consistent with those in the 
training set.
CONCLUSION: The ASII is an AKI-specific tool based on the combination of 
available inflammatory indices. A high ASII is a strong predictor of a higher 
risk of AKI and worse survival outcomes in patients in the ICU.

BACKGROUND: Electrolyte disorder is prevalent in traumatic brain injury (TBI) 
patients. This study is designed to explore the association between initial 
serum magnesium levels and mortality of TBI patients.
METHODS: TBI patients recorded in the Medical Information Mart for Intensive 
Care-III database were screened for this study. Logistic regression analysis was 
used to explore risk factors for mortality of included TBI patients. The 
restricted cubic spline (RCS) was applied to fit the correlation between initial 
serum magnesium level and mortality of TBI.
RESULTS: The 30-day mortality of included TBI patients was 17.0%. Patients with 
first-tertile and third-tertile serum magnesium levels had higher mortality than 
those of the second tertile. Univariate regression analysis showed that the 
serum magnesium level was not associated with mortality. Unadjusted RCS 
indicated the relationship between serum magnesium level mortality was U-shaped. 
After adjusting confounding effects, multivariate regression analysis presented 
that serum magnesium level was positively associated with mortality.
CONCLUSION: TBI patients with abnormally low or high levels of serum magnesium 
both have a higher incidence of mortality. At the same time, a higher initial 
serum magnesium level is independently associated with mortality in TBI 
patients. Physicians should pay attention to the clinical management of TBI 
patients, especially those with higher serum magnesium levels.

Background: Sepsis is a serious public health problem worldwide. Blood pressure 
is one of the indicators that is closely monitored in intensive-care units, and 
it reflects complex interactions between the internal cardiovascular control 
mechanism and the external environment. We aimed to determine the impact of 
indicators related to the ambulatory blood pressure on the prognosis of sepsis 
patients. Methods: This retrospective study was based on the Medical Information 
Mart for Intensive Care IV database. Relevant information about sepsis patients 
was extracted according to specific inclusion and exclusion criteria. Examined 
parameters included the average blood pressure, blood pressure variability 
(BPV), and circadian rhythm, and the study outcome was in-hospital death. We 
investigated the effects of these indicators on the risk of in-hospital death 
among sepsis patients using Cox proportional-hazards models, restricted cubic 
splines analysis, and subgroup analysis. Results: This study enrolled 10,316 
sepsis patients, among whom 2,117 died during hospitalization. All parameters 
except the nighttime variation coefficient of the diastolic blood pressure (DBP) 
were associated with in-hospital death of sepsis patients. All parameters except 
for fluctuations in DBP exhibited nonlinear correlations with the outcome. The 
subgroup analysis revealed that some of the examined parameters were associated 
with in-hospital death only in certain subgroups. Conclusion: Indicators related 
to the ambulatory blood pressure within 24 h are related to the prognosis of 
sepsis patients. When treating sepsis, in addition to blood pressure, attention 
should also be paid to BPV and the circadian rhythm in order to improve the 
prognosis and the survival rate.

Handling Class Imbalance in Machine Learning-based Prediction Models: A Case 
Study in Asthma Management.

Budiarto A, Sheikh A, Wilson A, Price DB, Shah SA.

A data-driven prediction tool has the potential to provide early warning of an 
asthma attack and improve asthma management and outcomes. Most previous machine 
learning (ML)-based studies for asthma attack prediction have reported a severe 
class imbalance, with major implications for model performance. We aimed to 
undertake a systematic comparison of several class imbalance handling techniques 
in the context of risk prediction models for asthma prognosis. We used data from 
9,835 asthma patients extracted from the Medical Information Mart for Intensive 
Care (MIMIC) IV database and deployed five class imbalance handling methods 
based on synthetic minority oversampling technique (SMOTE) and cost function 
customisation. We then compared their performances in improving two-class 
classifier models developed using logistic regression (LR) and extreme gradient 
boosting (XGBoost) for three different prediction tasks with varying severity of 
class imbalance (proportion of majority class ranging from 90.86% to 98.98%). 
The cost function customisation technique substantially outperformed the 
SMOTE-based methods in all tasks. XGBoost combined with cost function 
customisation achieved the highest prediction performance for the outcome with 
the most extreme class imbalance ratio (AUC = 0.72). Our findings suggest that 
the cost function customisation-based approach to tackle class imbalance 
provides substantially better performance compared to oversampling in the 
context of asthma management.Clinical Relevance- This study underscores the 
challenge of class imbalance in the context of prediction tools to improve 
asthma management and outcomes and provides a methodological solution that 
addresses the challenge. Accurate asthma prediction tools can provide early 
warning and potentially prevent deterioration thereby improving the quality of 
life of patients with asthma.

AIMS: Hypokalemia is a common complication following traumatic brain injury, 
which may complicate treatment and lead to unfavorable outcomes. Identifying 
patients at risk of hypokalemia on the first day of admission helps to implement 
prophylactic treatment, reduce complications, and improve prognosis.
METHODS: This multicenter retrospective study was performed between January 2017 
and December 2020 using the electronic medical records of patients admitted due 
to traumatic brain injury. A propensity score matching approach was adopted with 
a ratio of 1:1 to overcome overfitting and data imbalance during subgroup 
analyses. Five machine learning algorithms were applied to generate a 
best-performed prediction model for in-hospital hypokalemia. The internal 
fivefold cross-validation and external validation were performed to demonstrate 
the interpretability and generalizability.
RESULTS: A total of 4445 TBI patients were recruited for analysis and model 
generation. Hypokalemia occurred in 46.55% of recruited patients and the 
incidences of mild, moderate, and severe hypokalemia were 32.06%, 12.69%, and 
1.80%, respectively. Hypokalemia was associated with increased mortality, while 
severe hypokalemia cast greater impacts. The logistic regression algorithm had 
the best performance in predicting decreased serum potassium and 
moderate-to-severe hypokalemia, with an AUC of 0.73 ± 0.011 and 0.74 ± 0.019, 
respectively. The prediction model was further verified using two external 
datasets, including our previous published data and the open-assessed Medical 
Information Mart for Intensive Care database. Linearized calibration curves 
showed no statistical difference (p > 0.05) with perfect predictions.
CONCLUSIONS: The occurrence of hypokalemia following traumatic brain injury can 
be predicted by first hospitalization day records and machine learning 
algorithms. The logistic regression algorithm showed an optimal predicting 
performance verified by both internal and external validation.

BACKGROUND: The presence of acute kidney injury (AKI) significantly increases 
in-hospital mortality risk for cirrhotic patients. Early prognosis prediction 
for these patients is crucial. We aimed to develop and validate a machine 
learning model for in-hospital mortality prediction for cirrhotic patients with 
AKI.
METHODS: Data from cirrhotic patients with AKI hospitalized at the First 
Affiliated Hospital of Zhejiang University between January 1, 2013, and December 
31, 2020 were used to train and validate an extreme Gradient Boosting model to 
predict in-hospital mortality risk. The Boruta algorithm was used for variable 
selection. The optimal model was selected and named as PHM-CPA (Prediction of 
in-Hospital Mortality for Cirrhotic Patients with AKI). The PHM-CPA model was 
then externally validated in patients from eICU Collaborative Research Database 
(eICU-CRD) and Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care III dataset (MIMIC). 
The predictive performance of PHM-CPA model was compared with that of logistic 
regression (LR) model and 25 previously reported models.
RESULTS: A total of 519 cirrhotic patients with AKI were enrolled in model 
training cohort, of whom 118 (23%) died during hospitalization. Fifteen 
variables from common laboratory tests were selected to develop the PHM-CPA 
model. The PHM-CPA model achieved an AUROC of 0.816 (95% CI, 0.763-0.861) in the 
internal validation cohort and 0.787 (95% CI, 0.745-0.830) in the external 
validation cohort. The PHM-CPA model consistently outperformed the LR model and 
25 previously reported models.
CONCLUSION: We developed and validated the PHM-CPA model, comprising readily 
available clinical variables, which demonstrated superior performance and 
calibration in predicting in-hospital mortality for cirrhotic patients with AKI.

BACKGROUND: Red blood cell (RBC) distribution width (RDW) to albumin ratio is a 
novel biomarker and its prognostic effect on critically ill patients with sepsis 
has not been extensively investigated. The objective of this study was to 
identify the prognostic value of the RDW to albumin ratio in these patients.
METHODS: Data were extracted from the Medical Information Mart for Intensive 
Care III (MIMIC-III) database. A Cox proportional hazards model and restricted 
cubic spline model were used to determine the association of RDW to albumin 
ratio with mortality. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves and 
Kaplan-Meier survival curves were applied, and the area under the curve (AUC) 
was used to compare the predictive value.
RESULTS: A total of 3,969 eligible patients were enrolled. The median RDW to 
albumin ratio was significantly higher in non-survivors than in survivors at 30 
and 90 days. Patients were divided into groups according to the RDW to albumin 
ratio, and the risk of 30- and 90-day mortality markedly increased in the group 
with a higher ratio. The relationship between the RDW to albumin ratio as a 
continuous variable and 30-day mortality also showed an upward trend in the 
restricted cubic spline. The AUC of the RDW to albumin ratio was 0.633 in 
discriminating 30-day mortality which was similar to that of the lactate to 
albumin ratio (AUC =0.617; P=0.133) and higher than that of the neutrophil 
percentage to albumin ratio (AUC =0.559; P<0.001).
CONCLUSIONS: The RDW to albumin ratio is a promising biomarker for assessing the 
prognosis of critically ill patients with sepsis. Its predictive value in 
determining mortality was found to be similar to that of the lactate to albumin 
ratio and superior to that of the neutrophil percentage to albumin ratio.

BACKGROUND: Identifying key variables is essential for developing clinical 
outcome prediction models based on high-dimensional electronic medical records 
(EMR). However, despite the abundance of feature selection (FS) methods 
available, challenges remain in choosing the most appropriate method, deciding 
how many top-ranked variables to include, and ensuring these selections are 
meaningful from a medical perspective.
METHODS: We developed a practical multi-step feature selection (FS) framework 
that integrates data-driven statistical inference with a knowledge verification 
strategy. This framework was validated using two distinct EMR datasets targeting 
different clinical outcomes. The first cohort, sourced from the Medical 
Information Mart for Intensive Care III (MIMIC-III), focused on predicting acute 
kidney injury (AKI) in ICU patients. The second cohort, drawn from the MIMIC-IV 
Emergency Department (MIMIC-IV-ED), aimed to estimate in-hospital mortality 
(IHM) for patients transferred from the ED to the ICU. We employed various 
machine learning (ML) methods and conducted a comparative analysis considering 
accuracy, stability, similarity, and interpretability. The effectiveness of our 
FS framework was evaluated using discrimination and calibration metrics, with 
SHAP applied to enhance the interpretability of model decisions.
RESULTS: Cohort 1 comprised 48,780 ICU encounters, of which 8,883 (18.21%) 
developed AKI. Cohort 2 included 29,197 transfers from the ED to the ICU, with 
3,219 (11.03%) resulting in IHM. Among the ten ML methods evaluated, the 
tree-based ensemble method achieved the highest accuracy. As the number of 
top-ranking features increased, the models' accuracy began to stabilize, while 
feature subset stability (considering sample variations) and inter-method 
feature similarity reached optimal levels, confirming the validity of the FS 
framework. The integration of interpretative methods and expert knowledge in the 
final step further improved feature interpretability. The FS framework 
effectively reduced the number of features (e.g., from 380 to 35 for Cohort 1, 
and from 273 to 54 for Cohort 2) without significantly affecting prediction 
performance (Delong test, p > 0.05).
CONCLUSION: The multi-step FS method developed in this study successfully 
reduces the dimensionality of features in EMR while preserving the accuracy of 
clinical outcome prediction. Furthermore, it improves the interpretability of 
risk factors by incorporating expert knowledge validation.

BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: Delirium is the most common neuropsychological 
complication among older adults admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) and is 
often associated with a poor prognosis. This study aimed to construct and 
validate an interpretable machine learning (ML) for early delirium prediction in 
older ICU patients.
METHODS: This was a retrospective observational cohort study and patient data 
were extracted from the Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care-IV database. 
Feature variables associated with delirium, including predisposing factors, 
disease-related factors, and iatrogenic and environmental factors, were selected 
using least absolute shrinkage and selection operator regression, and prediction 
models were built using logistic regression, decision trees, support vector 
machines, extreme gradient boosting (XGBoost), k-nearest neighbors and naive 
Bayes methods. Multiple metrics were used for evaluation of performance of the 
models, including the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve 
(AUC), accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, recall, F1 score, calibration plot, 
and decision curve analysis. SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) were used to 
improve the interpretability of the final model.
RESULTS: Nine thousand seven hundred forty-eight adults aged 65 years or older 
were included for analysis. Twenty-six features were selected to construct ML 
prediction models. Among the models compared, the XGBoost model demonstrated the 
best performance including the highest AUC (0.836), accuracy (0.765), 
sensitivity (0.713), recall (0.713), and F1 score (0.725) in the training set. 
It also exhibited excellent discrimination with AUC of 0.810, good calibration, 
and had the highest net benefit in the validation cohort. The SHAP summary 
analysis showed that Glasgow Coma Scale, mechanical ventilation, and sedation 
were the top three risk features for outcome prediction. The SHAP dependency 
plot and SHAP force analysis interpreted the model at both the factor level and 
individual level, respectively.
CONCLUSION: ML is a reliable tool for predicting the risk of critical delirium 
in elderly patients. By combining XGBoost and SHAP, it can provide clear 
explanations for personalized risk prediction and more intuitive understanding 
of the effect of key features in the model. The establishment of such a model 
would facilitate the early risk assessment and prompt intervention for delirium.

Hepatorenal syndrome (HRS) is a key contributor to poor prognosis in liver 
cirrhosis. This study aims to leverage the database to build a predictive model 
for early identification of high-risk patients. From two sizable public 
databases, we retrieved pertinent information about the cirrhosis patients' 
therapies, comorbidities, laboratory results, and demographics. Patients from 
the eICU database served as a test set for external validation, while patients 
from the MIMIC database were divided into training and validation groups. 
Variables were screened using LASSO regression, Extreme Gradient Boosting (XG 
Boost), and Random Forest (RF). Core risk factors were determined from the 
intersection of the three methods. A predictive model was constructed using 
multivariable logistic regression and visualized via a nomogram. Model 
performance was assessed using ROC curves, decision curve analysis (DCA), 
clinical impact curves (CIC), and calibration curves. Eight critical variables 
associated with HRS were identified using machine learning methods. The final 
predictive model, based on five key variables-spontaneous bacterial peritonitis, 
red blood cell count, creatinine, activated partial thromboplastin time, and 
total bilirubin-showed excellent discrimination, with AUCs of 0.832 (95% CI 
0.8069-0.8563) in the training set and 0.8415 (95% CI 0.8042-0.8789) in the 
validation set. The AUC in the external test set was 0.8212 (95% CI 
0.7784-0.864). By integrating the MIMIC-IV database and machine learning 
algorithms, we developed an effective predictive model for HRS in liver 
cirrhosis patients, providing a robust tool for early clinical intervention.

BACKGROUND: As a novel inflammatory index, the ratio of red cell distribution 
width (RDW) to platelet count (RPR) may have prognostic value in some critical 
illnesses. However, studies on the prognostic influence of RPR in patients with 
sepsis are few. This study is aimed at investigating the association between RPR 
levels and 28-day mortality in patients with sepsis.
METHODS: Data of patients with sepsis were obtained from the Medical Information 
Mart for Intensive Care III database. The best cut-off value was calculated by 
establishing the receiver operating characteristic curve (ROC), and the 
predictive ability of different indicators was compared through the area under 
the curve (AUC). The association between RPR levels and 28-day mortality was 
assessed using the Cox proportional hazards model. Restrictive cubic spline 
analysis was applied to the multivariable Cox model to investigate the nonlinear 
relationship between RPR and 28-day mortality.
RESULTS: A total of 3367 patients with sepsis were included in the study. A 
nonlinear relationship was observed between RPR and 28-day mortality, showing a 
trend of a first rapid increase and a gradual increase. For the prediction of 
mortality, the best cut-off value for RPR was 0.109, with an AUC of 0.728 (95% 
confidence interval [CI]: 0.709-0.747). The predictive capability of RPR was 
superior to those of RDW, platelet, SOFA score, and SAPS II score. After 
adjusting for various confounding factors, high RPR was significantly associated 
with increased mortality with adjusted hazard ratios of 1.210 (95% CI: 
1.045-1.400) for categorical variables and 2.826 (95% CI: 2.025-3.944) for 
continuous variables.
CONCLUSION: Elevated RPR level is significantly correlated with a high risk of 
28-day mortality in patients with sepsis and can be a new predictor of patient 
prognosis.

Early hospital mortality prediction is critical as intensivists strive to make 
efficient medical decisions about the severely ill patients staying in intensive 
care units (ICUs). As a result, various methods have been developed to address 
this problem based on clinical records. However, some of the laboratory test 
results are time-consuming and need to be processed. In this paper, we propose a 
novel method to predict mortality using features extracted from the heart 
signals of patients within the first hour of ICU admission. In order to predict 
the risk, quantitative features have been computed based on the heart rate 
signals of ICU patients suffering cardiovascular diseases. Each signal is 
described in terms of 12 statistical and signal-based features. The extracted 
features are fed into eight classifiers: decision tree, linear discriminant, 
logistic regression, support vector machine (SVM), random forest, boosted trees, 
Gaussian SVM, and K-nearest neighborhood (K-NN). To derive insight into the 
performance of the proposed method, several experiments have been conducted 
using the well-known clinical dataset named Medical Information Mart for 
Intensive Care III (MIMIC-III). The experimental results demonstrate the 
capability of the proposed method in terms of precision, recall, F1-score, and 
area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC). The decision tree 
classifier satisfies both accuracy and interpretability better than the other 
classifiers, producing an F1-score and AUC equal to 0.91 and 0.93, respectively. 
It indicates that heart rate signals can be used for predicting mortality in 
patients in the care units especially coronary care units (CCUs), achieving a 
comparable performance with existing predictions that rely on high dimensional 
features from clinical records which need to be processed and may contain 
missing information.

BACKGROUND: Neutrophil plays a pivotal role in the management of Klebsiella 
pneumoniae infection. Delineate the clinical characteristics and prognostic 
utility of neutrophil in severe patients with K. pneumoniae infection are 
crucial for clinical management and prognostic assessment.
METHODS: K. pneumoniae patients with different infection sites were enrolled 
from Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care IV and eICU Collaborative 
Research Database. Temporal variations of neutrophil counts within 30 days of 
clinical onset were examined using locally weighted scatterplot smoothing 
curves. Logistic regression analysis was performed to assess the relationship 
between neutrophil counts and hospital mortality.
RESULTS: A total of 1,705 patients caused by K. pneumonia were included in the 
study. The non-survivor group exhibited a comparatively older age and a higher 
proportion of K. pneumoniae infections originating from respiratory and 
bloodstream sources compared to the survivor group (38.4% vs 21.1%, p<0.0001, 
and 15.1% vs 10.3%, p=0.021). Patients combined with multiple drug resistance 
strains, respiratory infection, liver disease, and above 60 years exhibited a 
specific dynamic process of neutrophil levels. Neutrophils counts peaked at 
admission and 1-2 weeks later. There was a 'U'-shaped relationship between 
neutrophil counts and hospital mortality.
CONCLUSIONS: Neutrophils in K. pneumoniae infected patients have distinctive 
features and dynamic clinical trajectories. Close monitoring of severe patients 
infected with K. pneumoniae upon admission and during the first 1-2 weeks after 
admission is of utmost importance, particularly for patients with a neutrophil 
count exceeding 8.0×109/L.

PURPOSE: Although systolic blood pressure (SBP) is associated with acute renal 
injury (AKI), the relationship between baseline SBP and prognosis in critically 
ill patients with AKI is unclear. We aimed to assess the linearity and profile 
of the relationship between SBP at intensive care unit (ICU) admission and 
in-hospital mortality in these patients.
METHODS: Data of AKI patients in the ICU settings were extracted from the 
Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care III database. The association 
between seven SBP categories (< 100, 100-109, 110-119, 120-129, 130-139, 
140-149, and ≥ 150 mmHg) and all-cause in-hospital mortality was assessed by Cox 
proportional hazard models. Restricted cubic spline analysis for the 
multivariate Cox model was performed to explore the shape of the relationship 
between SBP and mortality.
RESULTS: A total of 24,202 patients with AKI were included in this study. A 
typically U-shaped relationship was found between SBP at admission and 
in-hospital mortality. Among all SBP categories, the lowest risk of death was 
observed in patients with SBP around 110-119 mmHg, whereas the highest was noted 
in patients with extremely low SBP (< 100 mmHg), followed by those with 
extremely high SBP (≥ 150 mmHg). SBP showed a significant interaction with 
vasopressor use and AKI stage in relation to the risk of in-hospital mortality.
CONCLUSIONS: SBP upon admission showed a non-linear association with all-cause 
in-hospital mortality in critically ill patients with AKI. Patients with low or 
high SBP show an increased risk of mortality compared to patients with normal 
SBP.

BACKGROUND: Ischemic stroke (IS) accounts large amount of stroke incidence. The 
aim of this study was to discover the risk and prognostic factors that affecting 
the occurrence of IS in hypertensive patients.
METHOD: Study data were obtained from the Medical Information Mart for Intensive 
Care (MIMIC)-IV database. To avoid biased factors selection process, several 
approaches were studied including logistic regression, elastic net regression, 
random forest, correlation analysis, and multifactor logistic regression 
methods. And seven different machine-learning methods are used to construct 
predictive models. The performance of the developed models was evaluated using 
AUC (Area Under the Curve), prediction accuracy, precision, recall, F1 score, 
PPV (Positive Predictive Value) and NPV (Negative Predictive Value). Interaction 
analysis was conducted to explore potential relationships between influential 
factors.
RESULTS: The study included 92,514 hypertensive patients, of which 1746 
hypertensive patients experienced IS. The Gradient Boosted Decision Tree (GBDT) 
model outperformed the other prediction model terms of prediction accuracy and 
AUC values in both ischemic and prognosis cases. By using the SHapley Additive 
exPlanations (SHAP), we found that a range of factors and corresponding 
interactions between factors are important risk factors for IS and its prognosis 
in hypertensive patients.
CONCLUSION: The study identified factors that increase the risk of IS and poor 
prognosis in hypertensive patients, which may provide guidance for clinical 
diagnosis and treatment.

BACKGROUND: Elevated circulating levels of albumin (ALB) are often associated 
with improved prognosis in patients with heart failure (HF). However, 
investigations of its association with hospital death and long-term death in HF 
patients in the intensive care unit (ICU) are limited.
AIM: We examined whether increased blood ALB levels (first value at admission 
and maximum and minimum values in the ICU) were related to a greater risk of 
hospital death and long-term death in ICU patients with HF.
METHODS: For the first time, we analyzed 4084 ICU patients with HF admitted to 
the ICU in The Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care III (MIMIC-III) 
database.
RESULTS: Among 4084 HF patients, 774 (18.95%), 1056 (25.86%) and 1720 (42.12%) 
died in the hospital, within 30 days and 1 year, respectively. We conducted a 
logistic regression analysis and found significant inverse associations between 
blood ALB concentration and risk of hospital death, 30-day death and 1-year 
death when the covariates including age, sex, myocardial infarction (MI), 
hypertension, diabetes, valvular diseases, atrial fibrillation, stroke and 
chronic kidney disease (CKD) were adjusted. We additionally used a smooth curve 
for univariate analysis to establish an association between blood ALB 
concentration and death risk. Surprisingly, we observed U-shaped correlations 
between blood ALB concentration and hospital mortality, 30-day mortality and 
1-year mortality. We found that the "inflection point" for the blood ALB 
concentration at the lowest risk of death was 3.5 g/dL. We further observed that 
a higher blood ALB concentration (albumin-max) did not contribute to a reduced 
risk of death (hospital death, 30-day death and 1-year death) in HF patients 
with an albumin concentration >3.5 g/dL.
CONCLUSIONS: A lower blood ALB concentration contributed to a greater risk of 
hospital death and long-term death in HF patients admitted to the ICU, further 
suggesting that nutritional support in the ICU is highly important for improving 
the short-term and long-term mortality of HF patients. However, in HF patients 
without hypoproteinaemia (>3.5 g/dL), the impact of increased serum ALB on 
patient prognosis still needs to be demonstrated.

BACKGROUND: Acute kidney injury (AKI) carries a poor prognosis. Its incidence is 
increasing in the intensive care unit (ICU). Our purpose in this study is to 
develop and externally validate a model for predicting AKI in the ICU using 
patient data present prior to ICU admission.
METHODS: We used data of 98 472 adult ICU admissions at Mayo Clinic between 1 
January 2005 and 31 December 2017 and 51 801 encounters from Medical Information 
Mart for Intensive Care III (MIMIC-III) cohort. A gradient-boosting model was 
trained on 80% of the Mayo Clinic cohort using a set of features to predict AKI 
acquired in the ICU.
RESULTS: AKI was identified in 39 307 (39.9%) encounters in the Mayo Clinic 
cohort. Patients who developed AKI in the ICU were older and had higher ICU and 
in-hospital mortality compared to patients without AKI. A 30-feature model 
yielded an area under the receiver operating curve of 0.690 [95% confidence 
interval (CI) 0.682-0.697] in the Mayo Clinic cohort set and 0.656 (95% CI 
0.648-0.664) in the MIMIC-III cohort.
CONCLUSIONS: Using machine learning, AKI among ICU patients can be predicted 
using information available prior to admission. This model is independent of ICU 
information, making it valuable for stratifying patients at admission.

Background: A previous study has linked an increase in platelet-to-lymphocyte 
ratio (PLR) to a poor prognosis; however, the relationship between early change 
in PLR and outcomes in sepsis patients is unclear. Methods : The Medical 
Information Mart for Intensive Care IV database was for this retrospective 
cohort analysis on patients meeting the Sepsis-3 criteria. All the patients meet 
the Sepsis-3 criteria. The platelet-to-lymphocyte ratio (PLR) was calculated by 
dividing the platelet count by the lymphocyte count. We collected all PLR 
measurements that were available within 3 days of admission for analysis of 
longitudinal changes over time. Multivariable logistic regression analysis was 
used to determine the relationship between the baseline PLR and in-hospital 
mortality. After correcting for possible confounders, the generalized additive 
mixed model was used to examine the trends in PLR over time among survivors and 
nonsurvivors. Results: Finally, 3,303 patients were enrolled, and both low and 
high PLR levels were significantly associated with higher in-hospital mortality 
in the multiple logistic regression analysis (tertile 1: odds ratio, 1.240; 95% 
confidence interval, 0.981-1.568 and tertile 3: odds ratio, 1.410; 95% 
confidence interval, 1.120-1.776, respectively). The generalized additive mixed 
model results revealed that the PLR of the nonsurvival group declined faster 
than that of the survival group within 3 days after intensive care unit 
admission. After controlling for confounders, the difference between the two 
groups steadily decreased and increased by an average of 37.38 daily. 
Conclusions : There was a U-shaped relationship between the baseline PLR and 
in-hospital mortality of sepsis patients, and there was a significant difference 
between the nonsurvival and survival groups in the change in PLR over time. The 
early decrease in PLR was related to an increase in in-hospital mortality.

We retrospectively analyzed data from the Medical Information Mart for Intensive 
Care-III critical care database to determine whether visually-assessed right 
ventricular (RV) dysfunction was associated with clinical outcomes in septic 
shock patients. Associations between visually-assessed RV dysfunction by 
echocardiography and in-hospital mortality, lethal arrhythmia, and hemodynamic 
indicators to determine the prognostic value of RV dysfunction in patients with 
septic shock were analyzed. Propensity score analysis showed RV dysfunction was 
associated with increased risk of in-hospital death in patients with septic 
shock (adjusted odds ratio [OR] 2.15; 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.99-2.32; 
P < 0.001). In multivariate logistic regression analysis, RV dysfunction was 
associated with in-hospital death (OR 2.19; 95% CI 1.91-2.53; P < 0.001), lethal 
arrhythmia (OR 2.19; 95% CI 1.34-3.57; P < 0.001), and tendency for increased 
blood lactate levels (OR 1.31; 95% CI 1.14-1.50; P < 0.001) independent of left 
ventricular (LV) dysfunction. RV dysfunction was associated with lower cardiac 
output, pulmonary artery pressure index, and RV stroke work index. In patients 
with septic shock, visually-assessed RV dysfunction was associated with 
in-hospital mortality, lethal arrhythmia, and circulatory insufficiency 
independent of LV dysfunction. Visual assessment of RV dysfunction using 
echocardiography might help to identify the short-term prognosis of patients 
with septic shock by reflecting hemodynamic status.

BACKGROUND: The optimal threshold of hyperglycaemia at admission for identifying 
high-risk individuals in patients with acute myocardial infarction (AMI) and its 
impact on clinical prognosis are still unclear.
METHODS: We retrospectively reviewed 2027 patients with AMI admitted from June 
2001 to December 2012 in the 'Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care III' 
database. The significant cut-off values of admission blood glucose (Glucose_0) 
for predicting hospital mortality in patients with AMI with and without diabetes 
were obtained from the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve, then 
patients were assigned to hyperglycaemia and non-hyperglycaemia groups based on 
corresponding cut-off values. The primary endpoints were the hospital and 1-year 
mortality.
RESULTS: Among 2027 patients, death occurred in 311 patients (15.3%). According 
to the ROC curve, the significant cut-off values of Glucose_0 to predict 
hospital mortality were 224.5 and 139.5 mg/dL in patients with diabetes and 
without diabetes, respectively. The crude hospital and 1-year mortality of the 
hyperglycaemia subgroup were higher than the corresponding non-hyperglycaemia 
group (p< 0.01). After adjustment, regardless of the state of diabetes, 
hyperglycaemia at admission was related to significantly increased hospital 
mortality in patients with AMI. For patients with AMI without diabetes, 
hyperglycaemia at admission was positively correlated with the increase of 
1-year mortality (HR, 1.47; 95% CI 1.18 to 1.82; p=0.001). Nevertheless, this 
trend disappeared in those with diabetes (HR, 1.35; 95% CI 0.93 to 1.95; 
p=0.113).
CONCLUSION: Hyperglycaemia at admission was an independent predictor for 
mortality during hospitalisation and at 1-year in patients with AMI, especially 
in patients without diabetes.

was based on the Mann-Whitney U test and the least absolute shrinkage and 
selection operator (LASSO) regression model. Random Forest, eXtreme Gradient 
Boosting (XGBoost), Light Gradient Boosting Machine (LGBM), K-Nearest Neighbor 
(KNN) models, and their stacked model (the stacking ensemble model) were 
established. The area under of the curve (AUC) with 95% confidence interval 
(CI), sensitivity, specificity, as well as accuracy were applied to assess the 
performance of the predictive models.
RESULTS: A total of 5,998 patients with HF combined with AF were included, of 
which 4,198 patients were assigned to the training set and 1,800 to the testing 
set (7:3). Among these 4,198 patients, 624 (14.86%) died in-hospital and 3,574 
(85.14%) survived. Twenty-two features were used to construct the predictive 
model. Among these four single models, the AUC was 0.747 (95%CI: 0.717-0.777) 
for the Random Forest model, 0.755 (95%CI: 0.725-0.785) for the XGBoost model, 
0.754 (95%CI: 0.724-0.784) for the LGBM model, and 0.746 (95%CI: 0.716-0.776) 
for the KNN model in the testing set. The stacking ensemble model had the 
highest AUC compared to the four single models, with AUCs of 0.837 (95%CI: 
0.821-0.852) and 0.768 (95%CI: 0.740-0.796) for the training set and testing 
set, respectively.
CONCLUSION: The stacking ensemble model showed a good predictive effect in 
predicting in-hospital mortality in patients with HF combined with AF and may 
provide clinicians with a reference tool for early identification of mortality 
risk.

We determined the relative strengths of association between 23 most commonly 
ordered laboratory tests and the adverse outcome as indicators of relative 
criticalness. The lowest and highest results for 23 most commonly ordered 
laboratory tests, 24 hours prior to death during critical care unit (CCU) stay 
or discharge from CCU were extracted from a publicly available CCU database 
(Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care-III). Following this, the Random 
Forest model was applied to assess the association between the laboratory 
results and the outcomes (death or discharge). The mean decrease in Gini 
coefficient for each laboratory test was then ranked as an indication of their 
relative importance to the outcome of a patient. In descending order, the 10 
laboratory tests with the strongest association with death were: bicarbonate, 
phosphate, anion gap, white cell count (total), partial thromboplastin time, 
platelet, total calcium, chloride, glucose and INR; moreover, the strength of 
association was different for critically high versus low results.

BACKGROUND: Ischemic stroke (IS) and malignant tumor (MT) have high morbidity 
and mortality rates worldwide, and several associations exist between them. This 
study aimed to determine the effect of MT on hospital mortality in patients with 
IS.
METHODS: Based on their MT status, participants with IS in the Medical 
Information Mart for Intensive Care IV (MIMIC-IV) were divided into two groups. 
The primary outcome was in-hospital all causes mortality. Kaplan-Meier survival 
analysis was performed to evaluate the intergroup in-hospital mortality, and 
three Cox regression models were used to determine the association between MT 
and in-hospital mortality.
RESULTS: A total of 1605 participants (749 males and 856 females) were included 
in the study. The mean age was 72.030 ± 15.463 years. Of these, 257 (16%) 
patients died in the hospital. Kaplan-Meier analysis showed that the MT group 
had a significantly lower possibility of in-hospital survival than the non-MT 
group. In the unadjusted model, in-hospital mortality among MT patients had a 
higher odds ratio (OR) of 1.905 (95% CI, 1.320-2.748; P < 0.001) than the non-MT 
group. After adjusting for basic information, vital signs, and laboratory data, 
MT was also associated with increased in-hospital mortality (OR = 1.844, 95% CI: 
1.255-2.708; P = 0.002).
CONCLUSIONS: Among the patients with IS, the risk of all causes in-hospital 
mortality was higher for MT than for patients non-MT. This finding can assist 
clinicians in more accurately assessing prognosis and making informed treatment 
decisions.

BACKGROUND: Patients with acute myocardial infarction (AMI) complicated by acute 
kidney injury (AKI) tend to have a poor prognosis. However, the exact mechanism 
of the co-occurrence of the two diseases is unknown. Therefore, this study aims 
to determine the risk factors for severe AKI in patients with AMI.
METHODS: A total of 2022 patients were included in the Medical Information Mart 
for Intensive Care. Variables were identified via univariate logistic 
regression, and the variables were corrected via multivariate logistic 
regression. Restricted cubic splines were used to examine the risks associated 
with the variables. The Kaplan-Meier method was used to compare the risk of 
severe AKI among the patients.
RESULTS: Patients with severe AKI had a higher in-hospital mortality rate (28.6% 
vs. 9.0%, P < 0.001) and a longer duration of intensive care (6.5 days vs. 2.9 
days, P < 0.001). In patients with AMI, the mean systolic blood pressure (SBP); 
international normalized ratio (INR); the levels of blood urea nitrogen (BUN), 
glucose, and calcium; and a history of liver disease were found to be the 
independent risk factors for developing severe AKI after their admission. 
Increased levels of BUN and blood glucose and a high INR increased the risk of 
severe AKI; however, increased levels of calcium decreased the risk; SBP 
presented a U-shaped curve relationship.
CONCLUSIONS: Patients with severe AKI have a poor prognosis following an episode 
of AMI. Furthermore, in patients with AMI, SBP; INR; a history of liver disease; 
and the levels of BUN, glucose, and calcium are the independent risk factors for 
developing severe AKI after their admission.

OBJECTIVE: There was a lack of studies on the relationship between the presence 
or absence of echocardiography and the prognosis of type 2 diabetes mellitus 
(DM) patients. Therefore, we used the Medical Information Mart for Intensive 
Care (MIMIC)-IV database to explore the relationship between them.
METHOD: The patient information was obtained from the MIMIC-IV database. Taking 
age, BMI, sex, race, and marital status as scoring items, Propensity Score 
Matching was carried out according to the ratio of 1: 1. Generalized linear 
regression, multivariate logistic regression and hierarchical analysis were used 
to analyze the correlation between echocardiography and prognosis in type 2 DM 
patients.
RESULTS: A total of 9140 patients were enrolled in this study. There were 
differences in body mass index, days of type 2 DM, estimation of glomerular 
filtration rate, length of stay, survival time, readmission, marital status, 
family history of type 2 DM, drinking, smoking, metformin, coronary heart 
disease, heart failure, arrhythmia, hypertension, hyperlipidemia, 
cardiomyopathy, myocardial infarction, atherosclerosis, epilepsy, and thyroid 
diseases between patients with echocardiography and those without 
echocardiography. Echocardiography was independently related to survival time 
and readmission in type 2 DM patients. Besides, echocardiography was related to 
the survival time of patients with type 2 DM without complications.
CONCLUSIONS: We found for the first time that echocardiography was independently 
associated with the survival time of type 2 DM patients without complications.

Blood Urea Nitrogen-to-Albumin Ratio May Predict Mortality in Patients with 
Traumatic Brain Injury from the MIMIC Database: A Retrospective Study.

Traumatic brain injury (TBI), a major global health burden, disrupts the 
neurological system due to accidents and other incidents. While the Glasgow coma 
scale (GCS) gauges neurological function, it falls short as the sole predictor 
of overall mortality in TBI patients. This highlights the need for comprehensive 
outcome prediction, considering not just neurological but also systemic factors. 
Existing approaches relying on newly developed biomolecules face challenges in 
clinical implementation. Therefore, we investigated the potential of readily 
available clinical indicators, like the blood urea nitrogen-to-albumin ratio 
(BAR), for improved mortality prediction in TBI. In this study, we investigated 
the significance of the BAR in predicting all-cause mortality in TBI patients. 
In terms of research methodologies, we gave preference to machine learning 
methods due to their exceptional performance in clinical support in recent 
years. Initially, we obtained data on TBI patients from the Medical Information 
Mart for Intensive Care database. A total of 2602 patients were included, of 
whom 2260 survived and 342 died in hospital. Subsequently, we performed data 
cleaning and utilized machine learning techniques to develop prediction models. 
We employed a ten-fold cross-validation method to obtain models with enhanced 
accuracy and area under the curve (AUC) (Light Gradient Boost Classifier 
accuracy, 0.905 ± 0.016, and AUC, 0.888; Extreme Gradient Boost Classifier 
accuracy, 0.903 ± 0.016, and AUC, 0.895; Gradient Boost Classifier accuracy, 
0.898 ± 0.021, and AUC, 0.872). Simultaneously, we derived the importance 
ranking of the variable BAR among the included variables (in Light Gradient 
Boost Classifier, the BAR ranked fourth; in Extreme Gradient Boost Classifier, 
the BAR ranked sixth; in Gradient Boost Classifier, the BAR ranked fifth). To 
further evaluate the clinical utility of BAR, we divided patients into three 
groups based on their BAR values: Group 1 (BAR < 4.9 mg/g), Group 2 (BAR ≥ 4.9 
and ≤10.5 mg/g), and Group 3 (BAR ≥ 10.5 mg/g). This stratification revealed 
significant differences in mortality across all time points: in-hospital 
mortality (7.61% vs. 15.16% vs. 31.63%), as well as one-month (8.51% vs. 17.46% 
vs. 36.39%), three-month (9.55% vs. 20.14% vs. 41.84%), and one-year mortality 
(11.57% vs. 23.76% vs. 46.60%). Building on this observation, we employed the 
Cox proportional hazards regression model to assess the impact of BAR 
segmentation on survival. Compared to Group 1, Groups 2 and 3 had significantly 
higher hazard ratios (95% confidence interval (CI)) for one-month mortality: 
1.77 (1.37-2.30) and 3.17 (2.17-4.62), respectively. To further underscore the 
clinical potential of BAR as a standalone measure, we compared its performance 
to established clinical scores, like sequential organ failure assessment (SOFA), 
GCS, and acute physiology score III(APS-III), using receiver operator 
characteristic curve (ROC) analysis. Notably, the AUC values (95%CI) of the BAR 
were 0.67 (0.64-0.70), 0.68 (0.65-0.70), and 0.68 (0.65-0.70) for one-month 
mortality, three-month mortality, and one-year mortality. The AUC value of the 
SOFA did not significantly differ from that of the BAR. In conclusion, the BAR 
is a highly influential factor in predicting mortality in TBI patients and 
should be given careful consideration in future TBI prediction research. The 
blood urea nitrogen-to-albumin ratio may predict mortality in TBI patients.

BACKGROUND: Advances in oncology led to a substantial increase in the number of 
patients requiring admission to the ICU. It is significant to confirm which 
cancer critical patients can benefit from the ICU care like noncancer patients.
METHODS: An observational retrospective cohort study using intensive care unit 
(ICU) admissions of Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care III from the 
Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center in Boston, MA, USA between 2001 and 2012 
was conducted. Propensity score matching was used to reduce the imbalance 
between two matched cohorts. ICU patients with cancer were compared with those 
without cancer in terms of patients' characteristics and survival.
RESULTS: There were 38,508 adult patients admitted to ICUs during the period. 
The median age was 65 years (IQR, 52-77) and 8308 (21.6%) had an underlying 
malignancy diagnosis. The noncancer group had a significant survive advantage at 
the point of 28-day, 90-day, 365-day and 1095-day after ICU admission compared 
with cancer group (P < 0.001 for all) after PSM. Subgroup analysis showed that 
the diagnosis of malignancy didn't decrease 28-day and 90-day survive when 
patients' age ≥ 65-year, patients in surgical intensive care unit or cardiac 
surgery recovery unit or traumatic surgical intensive care unit, elective 
admissions, patients with renal replacement therapy or vasopressor support 
(P > 0.05 for all).
CONCLUSIONS: Malignancy is a common diagnosis among ICU patients. Patients 
without cancer have a survive advantage compared with patients with cancer in 
the short- and medium-term. However, in selected groups, cancer critical 
patients can benefit from the ICU care service like noncancer patients in the 
short-term.

OBJECTIVES: Diagnosis and management of intensive care unit (ICU)-acquired 
bloodstream infections are often based on positive blood culture results. This 
retrospective cohort study aimed to develop a classification model using 
data-driven characterisation to optimise the management of intensive care 
patients with blood cultures.
SETTING, METHODOLOGY/DESIGN: An unsupervised clustering model was developed 
based on the clinical characteristics of patients with blood cultures in the 
Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care (MIMIC)-IV database (n = 2451). It 
was tested using the data from the MIMIC-III database (n = 2047).
MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: The prognosis, blood culture outcomes, antimicrobial 
interventions, and trajectories of infection indicators were compared between 
clusters.
RESULTS: Four clusters were identified using machine learning-based k-means 
clustering based on data obtained 48 h before the first blood culture sampling. 
Cluster γ was associated with the highest 28-day mortality rate, followed by 
clusters α, δ, and β. Cluster γ had a higher fungal isolation rate than cluster 
β (P < 0.05). Cluster δ was associated with a higher isolation rate of 
Gram-negative organisms and fungi (P < 0.05). Patients in clusters γ and δ 
underwent more femoral site vein catheter placements than those in cluster β 
(P < 0.001, all). Patients with a duration of antibiotics treatment of 4, 6, and 
7 days in clusters α, δ, and γ, respectively, had the lowest 28-day mortality 
rate.
CONCLUSIONS: Machine learning identified four clusters of intensive care 
patients with blood cultures, which yielded different prognoses, blood culture 
outcomes, and optimal duration of antibiotic treatment. Such data-driven blood 
culture classifications suggest further investigation should be undertaken to 
optimise treatment and improve care.
IMPLICATIONS FOR CLINICAL PRACTICE: Intensive care unit-acquired bloodstream 
infections are heterogeneous. Meaningful classifications associated with 
outcomes should be described. Using machine learning and cluster analysis could 
help in understanding heterogeneity. Data-driven blood culture classification 
could identify distinct physiological states and prognoses before deciding on 
blood culture sampling, optimise treatment, and improve care.

Acute gastrointestinal (GI) bleeding are potentially life-threatening 
conditions. Early risk stratification is important for triaging patients to the 
appropriate level of medical care and intervention. Patients admitted to 
intensive care unit (ICU) has a high mortality, but risk tool is scarce for 
these patients. This study aimed to develop and validate a risk score to improve 
the prognostication of death at the time of patient admission to ICU. We 
developed and internally validated a nomogram for mortality in patients with 
acute GI bleeding from the eICU Collaborative Research Database (eICU-CRD), and 
externally validated it in patients from the Medical Information Mart for 
Intensive Care III database (MIMIC-III) and Wuhan Tongji Hospital. The 
performance of the model was assessed by examining discrimination (C-index), 
calibration (calibration curves) and usefulness (decision curves). 4750 patients 
were included in the development cohort, with 1184 patients in the internal 
validation cohort, 1406 patients in the MIMIC-III validation cohort, and 342 
patients in the Tongji validation cohort. The nomogram, which incorporated ten 
variables, showed good calibration and discrimination in the training and 
validation cohorts, yielded C-index ranged from 0.832 (95%CI 0.811-0.853) to 
0.926 (95CI% 0.905-0.947). The nomogram-defined high-risk group had a higher 
mortality than the low-risk group (44.8% vs. 3.5%, P < 0.001; 41.4% vs 3.1%, 
P < 0.001;53.6% vs 7.5%, P < 0.001; 38.2% vs 4.2%, P < 0.001). The model 
performed better than the conventional Glasgow-Blatchford score, AIMS65 and the 
newer Oakland and Sengupta scores for mortality prediction in both the 
derivation and validation cohorts concerning discrimination and usefulness. Our 
nomogram is a reliable prognostic tool that might be useful to identify 
high-risk acute GI bleeding patients admitted to ICU.

BACKGROUND: Disturbances in serum osmolality are associated with poor prognosis 
in many diseases and are more likely to occur in patients with traumatic brain 
injury (TBI). However, studies correlating serum osmolality and patient 
prognosis are lacking. Therefore, this study investigated the correlation 
between serum osmolality and in-hospital all-cause mortality in patients with 
TBI based on a large sample of TBI patients from the Medical Information Mart 
for Intensive Care-IV (MIMIV-IV) database.
METHODS: Patients were categorized into 4 groups based on serum osmolality 
levels and the association between serum osmolality and in-hospital all-cause 
mortality was assessed by constructing univariate and multivariate logistic 
regression analyses. Restricted cubic spline (RCS) curves were plotted to 
further assess nonlinear associations between study variables and outcomes. 
Kaplan-Meier analysis was used to assess the survival of patients in each group, 
and differences between groups were assessed by the log-rank test. Sensitivity 
analysis was used to assess whether this association was established in 
different populations.
RESULTS: This study covered 1587 patients. The Q3 group had the lowest 
in-hospital mortality (7.6%). After fully adjusting for confounders, either 
lower or higher serum osmolality levels were associated with in-hospital 
all-cause mortality (Q1 vs. Q3: OR, 2.244 [1.333-3.857] p = 0.003; Q4 vs. Q3: 
OR, 2.160 [1.295-3.681] p = 0.004). The RCS curves showed a U-shaped 
correlation, with the inflection point located at a serum osmolality of 295.4 
mmol/L level.
CONCLUSIONS: There was a U-shaped relationship between serum osmolality and 
in-hospital all-cause mortality in TBI patients. Patients had the lowest 
in-hospital mortality when serum osmolarity was maintained at 295.4 mmol/L.

This study was conducted to investigate the relationship between atrial 
fibrillation and the clinical prognosis of patients with sepsis in intensive 
care unit. A total of 21,538 sepsis patients were enrolled in the study based on 
the Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care IV database, of whom 6,759 had 
AF. Propensity score matching was used to compare the clinical characteristics 
and outcomes of patients with and without AF. Besides, the inverse probability 
of treatment weighting, univariate and multivariate Cox regression analyzes were 
performed. Of the 21,538 patients, 31.4% had AF. The prevalence of AF increased 
in a step-by-step manner with growing age. Patients with AF were older than 
those without AF. After PSM, 11,180 patients remained, comprising 5,790 matched 
pairs in both groups. In IPTW, AF was not associated with 28-day mortality 
[hazard ratio (HR), 1.07; 95% confidence interval (CI), 0.99-1.15]. In 
Kaplan-Meier analysis, it was not observed difference of 28-day mortality 
between patients with and without AF. AF could be associated with increased ICU 
LOS, hospital LOS and need for mechanical ventilation; however, it does not 
remain an independent short-term predictor of 28-day mortality among patients 
with sepsis after PSM with IPTW and multivariate analysis.

AIMS: Both hypercapnia and hypocapnia are common in patients with acute heart 
failure (AHF), but the association between partial pressure of arterial carbon 
dioxide (PaCO2) and AHF prognosis remains unclear. The objective of this study 
was to investigate the connection between PaCO2 within 24 h after admission to 
the intensive care unit (ICU) and mortality during hospitalization and at 1 year 
in AHF patients.
METHODS AND RESULTS: AHF patients were enrolled from the Medical Information 
Mart for Intensive Care IV database. The patients were divided into three groups 
by PaCO2 values of <35, 35-45, and >45 mmHg. The primary outcome was to 
investigate the connection between PaCO2 and in-hospital mortality and 1 year 
mortality in AHF patients. The secondary outcome was to assess the prediction 
value of PaCO2 in predicting in-hospital mortality and 1 year mortality in AHF 
patients. A total of 2374 patients were included in this study, including 457 
patients in the PaCO2 < 35 mmHg group, 1072 patients in the PaCO2 = 35-45 mmHg 
group, and 845 patients in the PaCO2 > 45 mmHg group. The in-hospital mortality 
was 19.5%, and the 1 year mortality was 23.9% in the PaCO2 < 35 mmHg group. 
Multivariate logistic regression analysis showed that the PaCO2 < 35 mmHg group 
was associated with an increased risk of in-hospital mortality [hazard ratio 
(HR) 1.398, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.039-1.882, P = 0.027] and 1 year 
mortality (HR 1.327, 95% CI 1.020-1.728, P = 0.035) than the PaCO2 = 35-45 mmHg 
group. The PaCO2 > 45 mmHg group was associated with an increased risk of 
in-hospital mortality (HR 1.387, 95% CI 1.050-1.832, P = 0.021); the 1 year 
mortality showed no significant difference (HR 1.286, 95% CI 0.995-1.662, 
P = 0.055) compared with the PaCO2 = 35-45 mmHg group. The Kaplan-Meier survival 
curves showed that the PaCO2 < 35 mmHg group had a significantly lower 1 year 
survival rate. The area under the receiver operating characteristic curve for 
predicting in-hospital mortality was 0.591 (95% CI 0.526-0.656), and the 1 year 
mortality was 0.566 (95% CI 0.505-0.627) in the PaCO2 < 35 mmHg group.
CONCLUSIONS: In AHF patients, hypocapnia within 24 h after admission to the ICU 
was associated with increased in-hospital mortality and 1 year mortality. 
However, the increase in 1 year mortality may be influenced by hospitalization 
mortality. Hypercapnia was associated with increased in-hospital mortality.

After severe infection in osteomyelitis patients in the Intensive Care Unit 
(ICU), there's a higher risk of mortality. However, limited research exists on 
predicting prognosis. Develop a predictive model for 1-year mortality risk in 
ICU-admitted osteomyelitis patients to inform clinical diagnosis and treatment. 
MIMIC IV database was used to retrieve ICU data for osteomyelitis patients. The 
data were randomly split into training and validation sets (7:3 ratio). 
Univariate and multiple logistic regression identified independent predictors of 
one-year mortality and constructed a risk prediction nomogram in the training 
set. Predictive value of the nomogram was assessed using C-indexes, ROC curves, 
DCA, CIC and calibration curves. This study included a total of 1153 
osteomyelitis patients, with 137 deaths within one year. These patients were 
randomly divided into training (N = 807) and validation (N = 346) sets. In the 
training set, multiple features were identified as key predictors of one-year 
mortality in osteomyelitis patients in the ICU. These factors were incorporated 
into the nomogram model, demonstrating good identification performance, with 
AUCs of 0.872 and 0.826 for the training and validation sets, respectively. The 
calibration curve and ROC curve indicate excellent predictive accuracy. DCA 
suggests strong clinical utility and robust predictive efficiency. Further 
analysis through CIC illustrates the clinical effectiveness of this predictive 
model. We have developed a nomogram model to predict the 1-year mortality rate 
for osteomyelitis patients admitted to the ICU, providing valuable predictive 
information for clinical decision-making.

Inflammation plays a significant role in the occurrence and development of acute 
kidney injury (AKI). Evidence regarding the prognostic effect of the systemic 
immune-inflammation index (SII) in critically ill patients with AKI is scarce. 
The aim of this study was to assess the association between SII and all-cause 
mortality in these patients. Detailed clinical data were extracted from the 
Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care Database (MIMIC)-IV. The primary 
outcome was set as the in-hospital mortality. A total of 10,764 AKI patients 
were enrolled in this study. The restricted cubic splines analyses showed a 
J-shaped curve between SII and the risk of in-hospital and ICU mortality. After 
adjusting for relevant confounders, multivariate Cox regression analysis showed 
that both lower and higher SII levels were associated with an elevated risk of 
in-hospital all-cause mortality. A similar trend was observed for ICU mortality. 
In summary, we found that the SII was associated in a J-shaped pattern with 
all-cause mortality among critically ill patients with AKI. SII appears to be 
have potential applications in the clinical setting as a novel and easily 
accessible biomarker for predicting the prognosis of AKI patients.

BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: There are several disease severity scores being used 
for the prediction of mortality in critically ill patients. However, none of 
them was developed and validated specifically for patients with severe sepsis. 
The present study aimed to develop a novel prediction score for severe sepsis.
RESULTS: A total of 3206 patients with severe sepsis were enrolled, including 
1054 non-survivors and 2152 survivors. The LASSO score showed the best 
discrimination (area under curve: 0.772; 95% confidence interval: 0.735-0.810) 
in the validation cohort as compared with other scores such as simplified acute 
physiology score II, acute physiological score III, Logistic organ dysfunction 
system, sequential organ failure assessment score, and Oxford Acute Severity of 
Illness Score. The calibration slope was 0.889 and Brier value was 0.173.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: The study employed a single center database called 
Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care-III) MIMIC-III for analysis. Severe 
sepsis was defined as infection and acute organ dysfunction. Clinical and 
laboratory variables used in clinical routines were included for screening. 
Subjects without missing values were included, and the whole dataset was split 
into training and validation cohorts. The score was coined LASSO score because 
variable selection was performed using the least absolute shrinkage and 
selection operator (LASSO) technique. Finally, the LASSO score was evaluated for 
its discrimination and calibration in the validation cohort.
CONCLUSIONS: The study developed the LASSO score for mortality prediction in 
patients with severe sepsis. Although the score had good discrimination and 
calibration in a randomly selected subsample, external validations are still 
required.

OBJECTIVE: To examine the characteristics and risk factors associated with 
30-day readmissions, including the impact of home health care (HHC), among older 
sepsis survivors transitioning from hospital to home.
RESEARCH DESIGN: Retrospective cohort study of the Medical Information Mart for 
Intensive Care (MIMIC)-IV data (2008-2019), using generalized estimating 
equations (GEE) models adjusting for patient sociodemographic and clinical 
characteristics.
SUBJECTS: Sepsis admission episodes with in-hospital stays, aged over 65, and 
discharged home with or without HHC were included.
MEASURES: The outcome was all-cause hospital readmission within 30 days 
following sepsis hospitalization. Covariates, including the primary predictor 
(HHC vs. Home discharges), were collected during hospital stays.
RESULTS: Among 9115 sepsis admissions involving 6822 patients discharged home 
(66.8% HHC, 33.2% Home), HHC patients, compared with those discharged without 
services, were older, had more comorbidities, longer hospital stays, more prior 
hospitalizations, more intensive care unit admissions, and higher rates of 
septic shock diagnoses. Despite higher illness severity in the HHC discharges, 
both groups had high 30-day readmission rates (30.2% HHC, 25.2% Home). GEE 
analyses revealed 14% higher odds of 30-day readmission for HHC discharges after 
adjusting for risk factors (aOR: 1.14; 95% CI: 1.02-1.27; P=0.02).
CONCLUSIONS: HHC discharges experienced higher 30-day readmission rates than 
those without, indicating the need for specialized care in HHC settings for 
sepsis survivors due to their complex health care needs. Attention to sepsis 
survivors, regardless of HHC receipt, is crucial given the high readmission 
rates in both groups. Further research is needed to optimize postacute 
care/interventions for older sepsis survivors.

BACKGROUND: Cirrhosis is a leading cause of global disease burden, with high 
mortality, particularly in critically ill patients. The blood urea nitrogen to 
creatinine ratio (BCR) is a straightforward biochemical indicator of renal 
excretory function and is linked to negative outcomes across different 
conditions. However, the relationship between BCR and mortality in critically 
ill patients with cirrhosis is unclear, The purpose of this study is to explore 
this question.
METHODS: A retrospective cohort study was performed utilizing the MIMIC-IV 
database. We divided BCR into quartiles and evaluated 180-day and 365-day 
mortality as the primary outcomes. Kaplan-Meier survival analysis and 
multivariate Cox regression modeling were used to assess the link between BCR 
and mortality. Linear relationships were further determined using restricted 
cubic spline (RCS) curves, and finally, subgroup analyses were also performed.
RESULTS: In our study of 2,816 critically ill cirrhotic patients, elevated BCR 
was significantly linked to higher mortality at both 180 and 365 days. The top 
BCR quartile showed a 45% higher risk of 180-day mortality (HR=1.45, 95% CI: 
1.21-1.73) and a 38% higher risk of 365-day mortality (HR=1.38, 95% CI: 
1.17-1.63) relative to the bottom quartile. RCS analysis demonstrated a notable 
linear correlation between BCR and mortality risk. Subgroup analyses indicated a 
stronger association between BCR and mortality among older patients.
CONCLUSION: In critically ill cirrhotic patients, elevated BCR values are 
strongly linked to increased mortality risk. Our research highlights BCR's 
potential as a prognostic marker for cirrhosis, especially in elderly patients.

BACKGROUND: Among patients with acute respiratory failure requiring prolonged 
mechanical ventilation, tracheostomies are typically placed after approximately 
7 to 10 days. Yet half of patients admitted to the intensive care unit receiving 
tracheostomy will die within a year, often within three months. Existing 
mortality prediction models for prolonged mechanical ventilation, such as the 
ProVent Score, have poor sensitivity and are not applied until after 14 days of 
mechanical ventilation. We developed a model to predict 3-month mortality in 
patients requiring more than 7 days of mechanical ventilation using deep 
learning techniques and compared this to existing mortality models.
METHODS: Retrospective cohort study. Setting: The Medical Information Mart for 
Intensive Care III Database. Patients: All adults requiring ≥ 7 days of 
mechanical ventilation. Measurements: A neural network model for 3-month 
mortality was created using process-of-care variables, including demographic, 
physiologic and clinical data. The area under the receiver operator curve 
(AUROC) was compared to the ProVent model at predicting 3 and 12-month 
mortality. Shapley values were used to identify the variables with the greatest 
contributions to the model.
RESULTS: There were 4,334 encounters divided into a development cohort (n = 
3467) and a testing cohort (n = 867). The final deep learning model included 250 
variables and had an AUROC of 0.74 for predicting 3-month mortality at day 7 of 
mechanical ventilation versus 0.59 for the ProVent model. Older age and elevated 
Simplified Acute Physiology Score II (SAPS II) Score on intensive care unit 
admission had the largest contribution to predicting mortality.
DISCUSSION: We developed a deep learning prediction model for 3-month mortality 
among patients requiring ≥ 7 days of mechanical ventilation using a neural 
network approach utilizing readily available clinical variables. The model 
outperforms the ProVent model for predicting mortality among patients requiring 
≥ 7 days of mechanical ventilation. This model requires external validation.

BACKGROUND: Advances in artificial intelligence (AI) have realized the potential 
of revolutionizing healthcare, such as predicting disease progression via 
longitudinal inspection of Electronic Health Records (EHRs) and lab tests from 
patients admitted to Intensive Care Units (ICU). Although substantial literature 
exists addressing broad subjects, including the prediction of mortality, 
length-of-stay, and readmission, studies focusing on forecasting Acute Kidney 
Injury (AKI), specifically dialysis anticipation like Continuous Renal 
Replacement Therapy (CRRT) are scarce. The technicality of how to implement AI 
remains elusive.
OBJECTIVE: This study aims to elucidate the important factors and methods that 
are required to develop effective predictive models of AKI and CRRT for patients 
admitted to ICU, using EHRs in the Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care 
(MIMIC) database.
METHODS: We conducted a comprehensive comparative analysis of established 
predictive models, considering both time-series measurements and clinical notes 
from MIMIC-IV databases. Subsequently, we proposed a novel multi-modal model 
which integrates embeddings of top-performing unimodal models, including Long 
Short-Term Memory (LSTM) and BioMedBERT, and leverages both unstructured 
clinical notes and structured time series measurements derived from EHRs to 
enable the early prediction of AKI and CRRT.
RESULTS: Our multimodal model achieved a lead time of at least 12 hours ahead of 
clinical manifestation, with an Area Under the Receiver Operating Characteristic 
Curve (AUROC) of 0.888 for AKI and 0.997 for CRRT, as well as an Area Under the 
Precision Recall Curve (AUPRC) of 0.727 for AKI and 0.840 for CRRT, 
respectively, which significantly outperformed the baseline models. 
Additionally, we performed a SHapley Additive exPlanation (SHAP) analysis using 
the expected gradients algorithm, which highlighted important, previously 
underappreciated predictive features for AKI and CRRT.
CONCLUSION: Our study revealed the importance and the technicality of applying 
longitudinal, multimodal modeling to improve early prediction of AKI and CRRT, 
offering insights for timely interventions. The performance and interpretability 
of our model indicate its potential for further assessment towards clinical 
applications, to ultimately optimize AKI management and enhance patient 
outcomes.

BACKGROUND Inflammation plays an important part in the pathogenesis of 
cardiogenic shock (CGS). Whether the neutrophil-lymphocyte ratio (NLR), an 
integrated biomarker of inflammation, is associated with the outcome of CGS 
patients remains unknown. This retrospective cohort study was performed to 
identify the utility of using NLR among patients with CGS. MATERIAL AND METHODS 
Data were extracted from the MIMIC database. We applied smooth curve fitting to 
define the NLR cutoff values. The primary outcome was 30-day mortality. Cox 
proportional hazards models, subgroup analysis, and receiver operator 
characteristic (ROC) curve analysis were performed. RESULTS A total of 1470 CGS 
patients were extracted, among which 801 (54.5%) were men. The mean age of the 
population was 70.37 years. An inverse U-shaped relationship was observed 
between NLR and mortality in CGS patients, with the highest risk being at values 
ranging from 9.4 to 15. For the primary outcome of 30-day mortality, the 
adjusted HR (95% CI) values of the middle tertile (NLR 9.4-15) and the upper 
tertile (NLR >15) were 1.47 (1.14, 1.88) and 1.22 (0.94, 1.57) compared with the 
reference of lower tertile (NLR <9.4). ROC curve analysis showed that NLR had a 
more sensitive prognostic value in predicting 30-day mortality of CGS than the 
neutrophil or lymphocyte percentage alone (0.660 vs. 0.540, 0.549). CONCLUSIONS 
An inverse U-shaped curve was presented between NLR and the mortality of CGS. 
NLR seemed to be a readily available and independent prognostic biomarker for 
patients with CGS. The prognostic value of NLR was more sensitive than the 
neutrophil or lymphocyte percentage alone, but not as good as SOFA or SAPSII 
score.

OBJECTIVES: The predictive intensive care unit (ICU) scoring system is crucial 
for predicting patient outcomes, particularly mortality. Traditional scoring 
systems rely mainly on structured clinical data from electronic health records, 
which can overlook important clinical information in narratives and images.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: In this work, we build a deep learning-based survival 
prediction model that utilizes multimodality data for ICU mortality prediction. 
Four sets of features are investigated: (1) physiological measurements of 
Simplified Acute Physiology Score (SAPS) II, (2) common thorax diseases 
predefined by radiologists, (3) bidirectional encoder representations from 
transformers-based text representations, and (4) chest X-ray image features. The 
model was evaluated using the Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care IV 
dataset.
RESULTS: Our model achieves an average C-index of 0.7829 (95% CI, 
0.7620-0.8038), surpassing the baseline using only SAPS-II features, which had a 
C-index of 0.7470 (95% CI: 0.7263-0.7676). Ablation studies further demonstrate 
the contributions of incorporating predefined labels (2.00% improvement), text 
features (2.44% improvement), and image features (2.82% improvement).
DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSION: The deep learning model demonstrated superior 
performance to traditional machine learning methods under the same feature 
fusion setting for ICU mortality prediction. This study highlights the potential 
of integrating multimodal data into deep learning models to enhance the accuracy 
of ICU mortality prediction.

BACKGROUND: Patients undergoing liver transplantation (LT) are at risk of 
perioperative neurocognitive dysfunction (PND), which significantly affects the 
patients' prognosis.
OBJECTIVE: This study used machine learning (ML) algorithms with an aim to 
extract critical predictors and develop an ML model to predict PND among LT 
recipients.
METHODS: In this retrospective study, data from 958 patients who underwent LT 
between January 2015 and January 2020 were extracted from the Third Affiliated 
Hospital of Sun Yat-sen University. Six ML algorithms were used to predict 
post-LT PND, and model performance was evaluated using area under the receiver 
operating curve (AUC), accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, and F1-scores. The 
best-performing model was additionally validated using a temporal external 
dataset including 309 LT cases from February 2020 to August 2022, and an 
independent external dataset extracted from the Medical Information Mart for 
Intensive Care Ⅳ (MIMIC-Ⅳ) database including 325 patients.
RESULTS: In the development cohort, 201 out of 751 (33.5%) patients were 
diagnosed with PND. The logistic regression model achieved the highest AUC 
(0.799) in the internal validation set, with comparable AUC in the temporal 
external (0.826) and MIMIC-Ⅳ validation sets (0.72). The top 3 features 
contributing to post-LT PND diagnosis were the preoperative overt hepatic 
encephalopathy, platelet level, and postoperative sequential organ failure 
assessment score, as revealed by the Shapley additive explanations method.
CONCLUSIONS: A real-time logistic regression model-based online predictor of 
post-LT PND was developed, providing a highly interoperable tool for use across 
medical institutions to support early risk stratification and decision making 
for the LT recipients.

BACKGROUND: Cardiac dysfunction, commonly observed in sepsis patients, is 
associated with higher mortality rates. The left ventricular stroke work index 
(LVSWI), an integrated parameter reflecting overall left ventricular function, 
may serve as a reliable and practical prognosticator for sepsis.
METHODS: Using the Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care (MIMIC III) 
database, we carried out a retrospective observational study that included adult 
patients who met the Sepsis-3 criteria. Kaplan-Meier survival curves and Cox 
proportional hazard models were applied to examine the association between LVSWI 
and 30-day all-cause mortality. Restricted cubic spline plots were used to 
assess the non-linear relationship between LVSWI and mortality, and subgroup 
analyses were conducted across various variables.
RESULTS: A total of 1,348 septic patients were included, with 300 (22.3%) 
fatalities. In multivariate Cox proportional hazard models, a significant 
negative relationship between LVSWI and mortality was observed, with a 31% 
reduction in mortality risk associated with an increase of one standard 
deviation in LVSWI (hazard ratio [HR]: 0.69, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 
0.51-0.93, p = 0.016), following adjustment for confounders. Restricted cubic 
spline plots unveiled a non-linear, L-shaped relationship between LVSWI and 
mortality. Furthermore, a two-piecewise regression model identified the critical 
inflection point at 27.83 g·m/m², with HR (95% CI) values of 0.93 (0.90-0.96; 
p < 0.001) on the left and 1.00 (0.99-1.01; p = 0.913) on the right.
CONCLUSIONS: The LVSWI exhibited an L-shaped relationship with 30-day mortality 
in patients with sepsis, underscoring the potential of LVSWI as a dependable 
prognostic indicator for sepsis. Further studies are needed to confirm these 
findings and to investigate whether early interventions to optimize LVSWI could 
improve outcomes in this patient population.

We aimed to determine prognostic indicators of PE patients with hemodynamic 
decompensation admitted to the ICU. PE patients with hemodynamic decompensation 
at ICU admission from Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care IV database 
were included. Least absolute shrinkage and selection operator with 2 specific 
lambdas were performed to reduce the dimension of variables after univariate 
analysis. Then we conducted multivariate logistic regression analysis and 2 
models were built. A total of 548 patients were included, among whom 187 died. 
Lactate, creatine-kinase MB, troponin-T were significantly higher in death 
group. Eight common factors were screened out from first model statistically 
mostly in consistent with second model: older age, decreased hemoglobin, 
elevated anion gap, elevated International Standard Ratio (INR), elevated 
respiratory rate, decreased temperature, decreased blood oxygen saturation 
(SpO2) and the onset of cardiac arrest were significantly risk factors for 
in-Hospital mortality. The nonlinear relationships between these indicators and 
mortality were showed by the restricted cubic spline and cutoff values were 
determined. Our study demonstrated that age, hemoglobin levels, anion gap 
levels, INR, respiratory rate, temperature, SpO2 levels, the onset of cardiac 
arrest could be applied to predict mortality of PE patients with hemodynamic 
decompensation at ICU admission.

BACKGROUND: The Triglyceride-Glucose (TyG) index, a reliable marker for insulin 
resistance, is now employed to assess the onset and prognosis of various 
conditions like acute coronary syndrome, chronic kidney disease, and ischemic 
stroke. However, whether the TyG index can be used to assess respiratory failure 
(RF) risk among Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) patients remains 
uncertain. The present study aims to delve into the link between the TyG index 
and the risk of RF in COPD patients.
METHODS: Individuals with COPD were retrospectively acquired from the MIMIC-IV 
2.2 (The Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care IV, version 2.2) database. 
The association between the TyG index and the probability of RF among COPD 
patients was evaluated using Cox proportional hazards models and restricted 
cubic spline (RCS) curves. Cumulative incidence curves were generated to 
appraise the RF risk across the quartile groups. Finally, 1188 patients were 
recruited from the First Hospital of Jiaxing City to externally validate the Cox 
modeling results for the primary outcome.
RESULTS: This study incorporated a total of 1,232 participants from MIMIC 
database. Among these individuals, 134 cases (10.9%) experienced RF. According 
to Cox regression analysis, a one-unit increment in the TyG index was linked to 
a 1.821-fold elevated risk of RF in the COPD population (HR, 1.821[95% CI 
1.349-2.459], P < 0.001). High TyG index levels were significantly linked to a 
higher RF risk (HR, 3.510 [95% CI 1.885-6.535], P < 0.001). RCS curve analysis 
also signaled a linear correlation between the TyG index and RF risk 
(P-Nonlinear = 0.074).
CONCLUSION: There exists a certain correlation between high-level TyG index and 
the risk of RF occurrence in COPD patients, indicating promising prospects for 
utilizing the TyG index to assess the severity of COPD patients.

BACKGROUND: Sepsis-induced myocardial injury (SIMI) is a severe and common 
complication of sepsis; However, its definition remains unclear. Prognostic 
analyses may vary depending on the definition applied. Early prediction of SIMI 
is crucial for timely intervention, ultimately improving patient outcomes. This 
study aimed to evaluate the prognostic impact of SIMI and develop validated 
predictive models using advanced machine learning (ML) algorithms for 
identifying SIMI in critically ill sepsis patients.
METHODS: Data were sourced from the Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care 
IV (MIMIC-IV, v3.0) database. Patients meeting Sepsis-3.0 criteria were 
included, and SIMI was defined as troponin T (TNT) levels ≥0.1 ng/mL. Prognostic 
evaluation involved propensity score matching, inverse probability weighting, 
doubly robust analysis, logistic regression, and Cox regression. Patients were 
divided into training and testing datasets in a 7:3 ratio. Least absolute 
shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) regression was used for variable 
selection to simplify the model. Twelve hyperparameter-tuned ML models were 
developed and evaluated using visualized heatmaps. The best-performing model was 
deployed as a web-based application.
RESULTS: Among 2,435 patients analyzed, 571 (23.45%) developed SIMI following 
intensive care unit (ICU) admission. Boruta and LASSO identified 46 and 10 key 
variables, respectively, for prognostic and predictive modeling. Doubly robust 
analysis revealed significantly worse short- and intermediate-term outcomes for 
SIMI patients, including increased in-ICU mortality [odds ratio (OR) 1.39, 95% 
confidence interval (CI) 1.02-1.85, p < 0.05], 28-day mortality (OR 1.35, 95% CI 
1.02-1.79, p < 0.05), and 180-day mortality [hazard ratio (HR) 1.21, 95% CI 
1.01-1.44, p < 0.05]. However, one-year mortality showed no significant 
difference (HR 1.03, 95% CI 0.99-1.08, p = 0.169). The XGBoost model 
outperformed others, achieving an area under the receiver operating 
characteristic curve (AUROC) of 0.83 (95% CI 0.79-0.87). SHapley Additive 
exPlanations (SHAP) analysis highlighted the top five predictive features: 
creatine kinase-myocardial band (CKMB), creatinine, alanine aminotransferase 
(ALT), lactate, and blood urea nitrogen (BUN). A web-based application was 
subsequently developed for real-world use.
CONCLUSION: SIMI significantly worsens patient prognosis, while the XGBoost 
model demonstrated excellent predictive performance. The development of a 
web-based application provides clinicians with a practical tool for timely 
intervention, potentially improving outcomes for septic patients.

PURPOSE: We sought to evaluate the association of prolonged elevated heart rate 
(peHR) with survival in acutely ill patients.
METHODS: We used a large observational intensive care unit (ICU) database 
(Multiparameter Intelligent Monitoring in Intensive Care III [MIMIC-III]), where 
frequent heart rate measurements were available. The peHR was defined as a heart 
rate >100 beats/min in 11 of 12 consecutive hours. The outcome was survival 
status at 90 days. We collected heart rates, disease severity (simplified acute 
physiology scores [SAPS II]), comorbidities (Charlson scores), and International 
Classification of Diseases (ICD) diagnosis information in 31 513 patients from 
the MIMIC-III ICU database. Propensity score (PS) methods followed by inverse 
probability weighting based on the PS was used to balance the 2 groups (the 
presence/absence of peHR). Multivariable weighted logistic regression was used 
to assess for association of peHR with the outcome survival at 90 days adjusting 
for additional covariates.
RESULTS: The mean age was 64 years, and the most frequent main disease category 
was circulatory disease (41%). The mean SAPS II score was 35, and the mean 
Charlson comorbidity score was 2.3. Overall survival of the cohort at 90 days 
was 82%. Adjusted logistic regression showed a significantly increased risk of 
death within 90 days in patients with an episode of peHR (P < .001; odds ratio 
for death 1.79; confidence interval, 1.69-1.88). This finding was independent of 
median heart rate.
CONCLUSION: We found a significant association of peHR with decreased survival 
in a large and heterogenous cohort of ICU patients.

Dementia limits timely revascularization in individuals with acute myocardial 
infarction (AMI). However, it remains unclear whether dementia affects prognosis 
negatively in older individuals with AMI in the intensive care unit (ICU). This 
research aimed to evaluate the dementia effect on the outcomes in individuals 
with AMI in ICU.Data from 3,582 patients aged ≥ 65 years with AMI in ICU from 
the Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care IV (MIMIC IV) database were 
evaluated. The independent variable was dementia at baseline, and the primary 
finding was death from any cause during follow-up. A 1:1 propensity score 
matching (PSM) showed 208 participants with and without dementia. The 
correlation between dementia and poor prognosis of AMI was verified using a 
double-robust estimation method.In the PSM cohort, the 30-day all-cause 
mortality was 37.50% and 33.17% in the dementia and non-dementia groups (P = 
0.356), respectively, and the 1-year all-cause mortality was 61.06% and 51.44%, 
respectively (P = 0.048). Cox regression analysis showed no association between 
dementia and elevated 30-day (hazard ratio [HR] 1.15, 95% confidence interval 
[CI] 0.84, 1.60) and 1-year (HR 1.28, 95% CI 0.99, 1.66) all-cause mortality 
after AMI. Similarly, dementia was not connected with in-hospital mortality, 
bleeding, or stroke after AMI. Interaction analysis showed that 1-year all-cause 
mortality was 48.00% higher in individuals with dementia and diabetic 
complications than in those without diabetic complications.Dementia is not an 
independent risk factor for adverse outcomes in AMI. Thus, it may be 
inappropriate to include dementia as a contraindication for invasive AMI 
therapy.

AIMS: The short-term mortality of heart failure (HF) patients admitted to the 
intensive care unit (ICU) is reported to be high. This study aims to explore the 
association between white blood cell-to-haemoglobin ratio (WHR) and 30 day 
mortality from the admission to the ICU.
METHODS AND RESULTS: This retrospective cohort study was performed based on the 
Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care III (MIMIC-III) database (2001-12) 
and MIMIC-IV database (2008-19). Covariables were selected using the least 
absolute shrinkage and selection operator regression. Based on the optimal 
cutoff point selected using the survminer package, WHR was divided into 
high-ratio group (≥1.6) and low-ratio group (<1.6). The association between WHR 
and the risk of 30 day mortality was explored using univariate and multivariable 
Cox regression models. The area under the receiver operating characteristic 
curve (AUC) was calculated to evaluate the prediction performance of WHR. A 
total of 13 702 patients were included. After adjusting the potential 
covariates, high WHR was associated with a greater risk of 30 day mortality 
compared with low WHR [hazard ratio = 1.16, 95% confidence interval (CI): 
1.07-1.27, P < 0.001]. WHR also showed a good performance for the prediction of 
risk of 30 day mortality (AUC = 0.751, 95% CI: 0.746-0.756).
CONCLUSIONS: WHR was positively associated with and performed well to predict 
30 day mortality, indicating that WHR may be a reliable index to assess the 
prognosis of HF patients admitted to the ICU.

BACKGROUND: There is need to identify biomarkers for prognosis of acute 
respiratory distress syndrome (ADRS). This may allow early and accurate 
identification of patients with high-risk ARDS to guide adjustment of clinical 
treatment and nursing intervention, which would ultimately improve prognosis of 
patients with ARDS. Biomarkers based on a combination of fasting glucose and 
lymphocyte counts to predict prognosis in critically ill patients with ARDS 
remain undefined. In this study, we investigated the association between 
glucose-to-lymphocyte ratio (GLR) and in-hospital mortality.
METHODS: The study obtained data from Medical Information Mart for Intensive 
Care-IV (MIMIC-IV Version 1.0) database. We defined the GLR as fasting 
glucose/lymphocyte count and the patient in-hospital mortality was considered as 
the outcome. In addition, we employed linear and logistic regression models for 
analysis.
RESULTS: In total, 1,085 patients with ARDS were included in this study. The 
eligible participants included 498 female and 587 males, with a mean age of 
64.2 ± 17.5 years. Logistic regression analysis demonstrated that higher GLR was 
an independent risk factor for all-cause mortality (OR =1.67, 95% CI: 1.26-2.22) 
after adjusting for age, sex, anion gap, white blood cell count, congestive 
heart failure, sequential organ failure assessment (SOFA), SBP, DBP, and 
respiratory rate in both the dichotomized group and subgroups. We also analyzed 
the in-hospital mortality to ROC curves by comparing the value between 
SOFA + GLR and SOFA. The area under the curve (AUC) was 0.6991 for the 
SOFA + GLR (95% CI: 0.6634-0.7348), and 0.6613 for the SOFA (95% CI: 
0.6238-0.6988).
CONCLUSION: Our data showed that the GLR was an independent predictor of 
in-hospital mortality for patients with ARDS. The GLR is an integrated, readily 
available clinical biomarker for mortality in patients with ARDS.

INTRODUCTION: Sepsis is associated to a high mortality rate, and its severity 
must be evaluated quickly. The severity of illness scores used are intended to 
be applicable to all patient populations, and generally evaluate in-hospital 
mortality. However, patients with sepsis continue to be at risk of death after 
hospital discharge.
OBJECTIVE: To develop a model for predicting 1-year mortality in critical 
patients diagnosed with sepsis.
PATIENTS: The data corresponding to 5650 admissions of patients with sepsis from 
the Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care (MIMIC-III) database were 
evaluated, randomly divided as follows: 70% for training and 30% for validation.
DESIGN: A retrospective register-based cohort study was carried out. The 
clinical information of the first 24h after admission was used to develop a 
1-year mortality prediction model based on Stochastic Gradient Boosting (SGB) 
methodology. Variable selection was addressed using Least Absolute Shrinkage and 
Selection Operator (LASSO) and SGB variable importance methodologies. The 
predictive power was evaluated using the area under the ROC curve (AUROC).
RESULTS: An AUROC of 0.8039 (95% confidence interval (CI): [0.8033 0.8045]) was 
obtained in the validation subset. The model exceeded the predictive 
performances obtained with traditional severity of disease scores in the same 
subset.
CONCLUSION: The use of assembly algorithms, such as SGB, for the generation of a 
customized model for sepsis yields more accurate 1-year mortality prediction 
than the traditional scoring systems such as SAPS II, SOFA or OASIS.

OBJECTIVE: To investigate the relationship between stress glucose elevation and 
the risk of 28 d all-cause mortality in intensive care unit (ICU) patients, and 
to compare the predictive efficacy of different stress glucose elevation 
indicators.
METHODS: ICU patients who met the inclusion and exclusion criteria in the 
Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care Ⅳ (MIMIC-Ⅳ) database were used as 
the study subjects, and the stress glucose elevation indicators were divided 
into Q1 (0-25%), Q2 (>25%- 75%), and Q3 (>75%-100%) groups, with whether death 
occurred in the ICU and the duration of treatment in the ICU as outcome 
variables, and demographic characteristics, laboratory indicators, and 
comorbidities as covariates, Cox regression and restricted cubic splines were 
used to explore the association between stress glucose elevation and the risk of 
28 d all-cause death in ICU patients; and subject work characteristics [receiver 
operating characteristic (ROC) and the area under curve (AUC)] were used to 
evaluate the predictive efficacy of different stress glucose elevation 
indicators, The stress hyperglycemia indexes included: stress hyperglycemia 
ratio (SHR1, SHR2), glucose gap (GG); and the stress hyperglycemia index was 
further incorporated into the Oxford acute severity of illness score (OASIS) to 
investigate the predictive efficacy of the improved scores: the AUC was used to 
assess the score discrimination, and the larger the AUC indicated, the better 
score discrimination. The Brier score was used to evaluate the calibration of 
the score, and a smaller Brier score indicated a better calibration of the 
score.
RESULTS: A total of 5 249 ICU patients were included, of whom 7.56% occurred in 
ICU death. Cox regression analysis after adjusting for confounders showed that 
the HR (95%CI) for 28 d all-cause mortality in the ICU patients was 1.545 
(1.077-2.217), 1.602 (1.142-2.249) and 1.442 (1.001-2.061) for the highest group 
Q3 compared with the lowest group Q1 for SHR1, SHR2 and GG, respectively, and 
The risk of death in the ICU patients increased progressively with increasing 
indicators of stressful blood glucose elevation (Ptrend < 0.05). Restricted 
cubic spline analysis showed a linear relationship between SHR and the 28 d 
all-cause mortality risk (P>0.05). the AUC of SHR2 and GG was significantly 
higher than that of SHR1: AUCSHR2=0.691 (95%CI: 0.661-0.720), AUCGG=0.685 
(95%CI: 0.655-0.714), and AUCSHR1=0.680 (95%CI: 0.650-0.709), P < 0.05. The 
inclusion of SHR2 in the OASIS scores significantly improved the discrimination 
and calibration of the scores: AUCOASIS=0.820 (95%CI: 0.791-0.848), 
AUCOASIS+SHR2=0.832 (95%CI: 0.804-0.859), P < 0.05; Brier scoreOASIS=0.071, 
Brier scoreOASIS+SHR2=0.069.
CONCLUSION: Stressful glucose elevation is strongly associated with 28 d 
all-cause mortality risk in ICU patients and may inform clinical management and 
decision making in intensive care patients.

并比较不同应激性血糖升高指标的预测效能。
方法: 以重症医学(Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care Ⅳ, MIMIC-Ⅳ) 
数据库中符合纳入、排除标准的ICU患者为研究对象，将应激性血糖升高指标按照百分位数分为Q1(0~25%)、Q2(>25%~75%)、Q3(>75%~100%)组，以是否发生ICU内死亡及在ICU内接受治疗的时间为结局变量，以人口学特征、实验室指标、合并症等为协变量，利用Cox回归及限制性立方样条探究应激性血糖升高和ICU患者28 
d全因死亡风险之间的关联; 采用受试者工作特征(receiver operation characteristic, ROC)曲线下面积(area under 
curve, AUC)评价不同应激性血糖升高指标的预测效能，应激性血糖升高指标包括应激性血糖升高比值(stress hyperglycemia ratio, 
SHR) 1、SHR2、血糖间隙(glucose gap, GG); 进一步将应激性血糖升高指标纳入牛津急性疾病严重程度评分(Oxford acute 
severity of illness score, 
OASIS)，探究其改善评分的预测效能，即采用AUC评估评分区分度，AUC越大表明评分区分度越好，采用Brier score评价评分校准度，Brier 
score越小，表明评分校准度越好。
结果: 共纳入5 
249例ICU患者，其中发生ICU内死亡的患者占7.56%。调整混杂因素后的Cox回归分析结果表明，SHR1、SHR2和GG的最高组Q3与最低组Q1相比，ICU患者28 
d全因死亡HR(95%CI)分别为1.545(1.077~2.217)、1.602(1.142~2.249)和1.442(1.001~2.061)，且随着应激性血糖升高指标的增加，ICU患者死亡风险也逐渐增加(Ptrend 
< 0.05)。限制性立方样条分析表明，SHR和28 d全因死亡风险之间呈线性关系(P>0.05)。SHR2和GG的AUC显著高于SHR1: 
AUCSHR2=0.691(95%CI: 0.661~0.720)，AUCGG=0.685(95%CI: 
0.655~0.714)，AUCSHR1=0.680(95%CI: 0.650~0.709)，P < 
0.05。将SHR2纳入OASIS评分中，能显著提高评分的区分度和校准度：AUCOASIS=0.820(95%CI: 
0.791~0.848)，AUCOASIS+SHR2=0.832(95%CI: 0.804~0.859)，P < 0.05; Brier 
scoreOASIS=0.071，Brier scoreOASIS+SHR2= 0.069。
结论: 应激性血糖升高与ICU患者28 d全因死亡风险密切相关，可为重症监护患者的临床管理和决策提供参考。

BACKGROUND: Blood pressure is a critical therapeutic goal in intensive care unit 
(ICU). One important factor influencing blood pressure are analgesia and 
sedation. Analgesic and sedative drugs are commonly used in critically ill 
patients. These drugs affect blood pressure by reducing the tension of the 
venous system, the cardiac preload, and cardiac output and inhibiting cardiac 
functions. Consequently, vasoactive agents are commonly used to increase blood 
pressure. The indications for the usage of vasoactive agents are unequivocal. 
However, opinions on when to stop raising blood pressure vary. This study 
explored the relationship between blood pressure and sedation.
METHODS: Patients in the Multiparameter Intelligent Monitoring in Intensive 
Care-III (MIMIC) database who had received mechanical ventilation, had been 
administered sedative analgesics during their ICU stay, and met the inclusion 
criteria were included in this study. The mean arterial pressure (MAP) tendency 
patterns were identified using spectral clustering and visualized using the 
t-distributed Stochastic Neighbor Embedding (t-SNE) algorithm. The 28-day 
mortality rates of patients with different MAP patterns during their first 24 
hours in the ICU and their sedation levels were calculated in the crosstab.
RESULTS: Fourteen thousand seven hundred and eighty-five patients from the 
MIMIC-III database were included in this study. Three MAP patterns were 
identified by spectral clustering. The median MAP of the low, moderate, and high 
MAP groups was 71.2, 80.4, and 97.6 mmHg, respectively. The 28-day mortality 
rate of patients in the moderate MAP group (13.0%) was lower than that of 
patients in the low (16.6%) and high (15.6%) MAP groups. No difference was found 
in the 28-day mortality rate between the low and high MAP groups. Dynamic 
changes in blood pressure at different sedation depths were also examined. 
Notably, compared with light and moderate sedation level, patients in the deep 
sedation group, especially those in the high MAP group (48.5%), had a higher 
28-day mortality rate (36.5%).
CONCLUSIONS: Low MAP in the first 24 hours in ICU indicates a high possibility 
of poor prognosis for critically ill patients on mechanical ventilation. For 
patients under deep sedation, maintaining a high mean arterial pressure also 
indicates poor prognosis. A personalized MAP target should be determined 
according to the severity of illness and level of sedation for each patient.

OBJECTIVE: The growing availability of rich clinical data such as patients' 
electronic health records provide great opportunities to address a broad range 
of real-world questions in medicine. At the same time, artificial intelligence 
and machine learning (ML)-based approaches have shown great premise on 
extracting insights from those data and helping with various clinical problems. 
The goal of this study is to conduct a systematic comparative study of different 
ML algorithms for several predictive modeling problems in urgent care.
DESIGN: We assess the performance of 4 benchmark prediction tasks (eg mortality 
and prediction, differential diagnostics, and disease marker discovery) using 
medical histories, physiological time-series, and demographics data from the 
Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care (MIMIC-III) database.
MEASUREMENTS: For each given task, performance was estimated using standard 
measures including the area under the receiver operating characteristic (AUC) 
curve, F-1 score, sensitivity, and specificity. Microaveraged AUC was used for 
multiclass classification models.
RESULTS AND DISCUSSION: Our results suggest that recurrent neural networks show 
the most promise in mortality prediction where temporal patterns in physiologic 
features alone can capture in-hospital mortality risk (AUC > 0.90). Temporal 
models did not provide additional benefit compared to deep models in 
differential diagnostics. When comparing the training-testing behaviors of 
readmission and mortality models, we illustrate that readmission risk may be 
independent of patient stability at discharge. We also introduce a multiclass 
prediction scheme for length of stay which preserves sensitivity and AUC with 
outliers of increasing duration despite decrease in sample size.

OBJECTIVE: To investigate the death risk prediction factors of acute 
pancreatitis (AP) patients in intensive care unit (ICU), and to establish a 
death prediction model and evaluate its efficacy.
METHODS: A retrospective cohort study was conducted using the data in the 
Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care-III (MIMIC-III). The clinical data 
of 285 AP patients admitted to the ICU in the database were collected, including 
age, gender, blood routine and blood biochemical indicators, comorbidities, 
simplified acute physiology score III (SAPS III) and hospital prognosis. By 
using univariate analysis, the differences in the clinical data of the patients 
were compared between the two groups. Binary multivariate Logistic regression 
analysis was used to screen out independent predictors of in-hospital death in 
AP patients. A death prediction model was established, and the nomogram was 
drawn. The receiver operator characteristic curve (ROC curve) was plotted, and 
the area under the ROC curve (AUC) was used to test the discrimination of the 
prediction model. In addition, the prediction model was compared with the SAPS 
III score in predicting in-hospital death. The calibration ability of the 
prediction model was evaluated by the Hosmer-Lemeshow goodness of fit test, and 
a calibration map was drawn to show the calibration degree of the prediction 
model.
RESULTS: Among 285 patients with AP, 29 patients died in the hospital and 256 
patients survived. Univariate analysis showed that the patients in the death 
group were older than those in the survival group (years old: 70±17 vs. 58±16), 
and had higher white blood cell count (WBC), total bilirubin (TBil), serum 
creatinine (SCr), blood urea nitrogen (BUN), red blood cell volume distribution 
width (RDW), proportion of congestive heart failure and SAPS III score [WBC 
(×109/L): 18.5 (13.9, 24.3) vs. 13.2 (9.3, 17.9), TBil (μmol/L): 29.1 (15.4, 
66.7) vs. 16.2 (10.3, 29.1), SCr (μmol/L): 114.9 (88.4, 300.6) vs. 79.6 (53.0, 
114.9), BUN (mmol/L): 13.9 (9.3, 17.8) vs. 6.1 (3.7, 9.6), RDW: 0.152 (0.141, 
0.165) vs. 0.141 (0.134, 0.150), congestive heart failure: 34.5% vs. 14.8%, SAPS 
III score: 66 (52, 90) vs. 39 (30, 48), all P < 0.05]. Multivariate Logistic 
regression analysis showed that age [odds ratio (OR) = 1.038, 95% confidence 
interval (95%CI) was 1.005-1.073], WBC (OR = 1.103, 95%CI was 1.038-1.172), TBil 
(OR = 1.247, 95%CI was 1.066-1.459), BUN (OR = 1.034, 95%CI was 1.014-1.055) and 
RDW (OR = 1.344, 95%CI was 1.024-1.764) were independent risk predictors of 
in-hospital death in patients with AP. Logistic regression model was 
established: Logit(P) = 
0.037×age+0.098×WBC+0.221×TBil+0.033×BUN+0.296×RDW-12.133. ROC curve analysis 
showed that the AUC of the Logistic regression model for predicting the 
in-hospital death of patients with AP was 0.870 (95%CI was 0.794-0.946), the 
sensitivity was 86.2%, and the specificity was 78.5%, indicating that the model 
had good predictive performance, and it was superior to the SAPS III score [AUC 
was 0.831 (95%CI was 0.754-0.907), the sensitivity was 82.8%, and the 
specificity was 75.4%]. A nomogram model was established based on the result of 
multivariate Logistic regression analysis. The calibration map showed that the 
calibration curve of the nomogram model was very close to the standard curve, 
with the goodness of fit test: χ2 = 6.986, P = 0.538, indicating that the 
consistency between the predicted death risk of the nomogram model and the 
actual occurrence risk was relatively high.
CONCLUSIONS: The older the AP patient is, the higher the WBC, TBil, BUN, and 
RDW, and the greater the risk of hospital death. The death prediction Logistic 
regression model and nomogram model constructed based on the above indicators 
have good discrimination ability and high accuracy for high-risk patients with 
hospital death, which can accurately predict the probability of death in AP 
patients and provide a basis for prognosis judgment and clinical treatment of AP 
patients.

Patients undergoing transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR) have a high 
comorbid burden. Our objective was to assess the association between the 
age-adjusted Charlson comorbidity index (Age-CCI) and mortality and readmission 
rates within 1-year post-TAVR. Data were extracted from the Medical Information 
Mart for Intensive Care IV database (MIMIC-IV version 2.0). The primary endpoint 
was a composite outcome of all-cause mortality or readmission within 1-year 
after TAVR. To examine the associations of Age-CCI with outcomes, we used 
multivariable Cox proportional hazards regression, restricted cubic spline 
(RCS), and Kaplan-Meier curves. A total of 785 patients (52.9% male) with a 
median age of 84.0 years were assessed. More than half of our patients had an 
Age-CCI ≥ 7. After adjustment for potential confounders, we found that a 1 unit 
increase in Age-CCI was associated with a 10% increase in mortality and 
readmission rates after TAVR (HR = 1.10, 95% CI: 1.04-1.17, P < .001). High 
Age-CCI (Age-CCI ≥ 7) compared with the low Age-CCI (Age-CCI < 7) showed a 36% 
increase of mortality and readmission rates (HR = 1.36, 95% CI: 1.07-1.73, P = 
.013). The RCS curve analysis showed a continuous linear relationship between 
Age-CCI and the composite outcome risk (P for non-linearity = .671). The 
Kaplan-Meier survival analysis showed that patients with Age-CCI ≥ 7 had a 
poorer prognosis than those with Age-CCI < 7 (log-rank P < .001). Subgroup 
analyses showed the results remained stable. Age-CCI is independently associated 
with all-cause mortality and readmission in patients treated with TAVR, which 
may help clinicians risk-stratify patients and offer an opportunity to improve 
patient outcomes.

OBJECTIVE: Cellulitis is the most common cause of skin-related hospitalisations, 
and the mortality of patients with sepsis remains high. Some stratification 
models have been developed, but their performance in external validation has 
been unsatisfactory. This study was designed to develop and compare different 
models for predicting patients with cellulitis developing sepsis during 
hospitalisation.
DESIGN: This is a retrospective cohort study.
SETTING: This study included both the development and the external-validation 
phases from two independent large cohorts internationally.
PARTICIPANTS AND METHODS: A total of 6695 patients with cellulitis in the 
Medical Information Mart for Intensive care (MIMIC)-IV database were used to 
develop models with different machine-learning algorithms. The best models were 
selected and then externally validated in 2506 patients with cellulitis from the 
YiduCloud database of our university. The performances and robustness of 
selected models were further compared in the external-validation group by area 
under the curve (AUC), diagnostic accuracy, sensitivity, specificity and 
diagnostic OR.
PRIMARY OUTCOME MEASURES: The primary outcome of interest in this study was the 
development based on the Sepsis-3.0 criteria during hospitalisation.
RESULTS: Patient characteristics were significantly different between the two 
groups. In internal validation, XGBoost was the best model, with an AUC of 
0.780, and AdaBoost was the worst model, with an AUC of 0.585. In external 
validation, the AUC of the artificial neural network (ANN) model was the 
highest, 0.830, while the AUC of the logistic regression (LR) model was the 
lowest, 0.792. The AUC values changed less in the boosting and ANN models than 
in the LR model when variables were deleted.
CONCLUSIONS: Boosting and neural network models performed slightly better than 
the LR model and were more robust in complex clinical situations. The results 
could provide a tool for clinicians to detect hospitalised patients with 
cellulitis developing sepsis early.

BACKGROUND: The purpose of this study was to develop a Nomogram model to 
identify the risk of all-cause mortality during hospitalization in patients with 
heart failure (HF).
METHODS: HF patients who had been registered in the Medical Information Mart for 
Intensive Care (MIMIC) III and IV databases were included. The primary outcome 
was the occurrence of all-cause mortality during hospitalization. Two Logistic 
Regression models (LR1 and LR2) were developed to predict in-hospital death for 
HF patients from the MIMIC-IV database. The MIMIC-III database were used for 
model validation. The area under the receiver operating characteristic curve 
(AUC) was used to compare the discrimination of each model. Calibration curve 
was used to assess the fit of each developed models. Decision curve analysis 
(DCA) was used to estimate the net benefit of the predictive model.
RESULTS: A total of 16,908 HF patients were finally enrolled through screening, 
of whom 2,283 (13.5%) presented with in-hospital death. Totally, 48 variables 
were included and analyzed in the univariate and multifactorial regression 
analysis. The AUCs for the LR1 and LR2 models in the test cohort were 0.751 (95% 
CI: 0.735∼0.767) and 0.766 (95% CI: 0.751-0.781), respectively. Both LR models 
performed well in the calibration curve and DCA process. Nomogram and online 
risk assessment system were used as visualization of predictive models.
CONCLUSION: A new risk prediction tool and an online risk assessment system were 
developed to predict mortality in HF patients, which performed well and might be 
used to guide clinical practice.

The incidence of sepsis-induced coagulopathy (SIC) is high, leading to increased 
mortality rates and prolonged hospitalization and intensive care unit (ICU) 
stays. Early identification of SIC patients at risk of in-hospital mortality can 
improve patient prognosis. The objective of this study is to develop and 
validate machine learning (ML) models to dynamically predict in-hospital 
mortality risk in SIC patients. A ML model is established based on the Medical 
Information Mart for Intensive Care IV (MIMIC-IV) database to predict 
in-hospital mortality in SIC patients. Utilizing univariate feature selection 
for feature screening. The optimal model was determined by calculating the area 
under the curve (AUC) with a 95% confidence interval (CI). The optimal model was 
interpreted using Shapley Additive Explanation (SHAP) values. Among the 3112 SIC 
patients included in MIMIC-IV, a total of 757 (25%) patients experienced 
mortality during their ICU stay. Univariate feature selection helps us to pick 
out the 20 most critical variables from the original feature. Among the 10 
developed machine learning models, the stacking ensemble model exhibited the 
highest AUC (0.795, 95% CI: 0.763-0.827). Anion gap and age emerged as the most 
significant features for predicting the mortality risk in SIC. In this study, an 
ML model was constructed that exhibited excellent performance in predicting 
in-hospital mortality risk in SIC patients. Specifically, the stacking ensemble 
model demonstrated superior predictive ability.

Background: Acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) commonly develops in 
traumatic brain injury (TBI) patients and is a risk factor for poor prognosis. 
We designed this study to evaluate the performance of several machine learning 
algorithms for predicting ARDS in TBI patients. Methods: TBI patients from the 
Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care-III (MIMIC-III) database were 
eligible for this study. ARDS was identified according to the Berlin definition. 
Included TBI patients were divided into the training cohort and the validation 
cohort with a ratio of 7:3. Several machine learning algorithms were utilized to 
develop predictive models with five-fold cross validation for ARDS including 
extreme gradient boosting, light gradient boosting machine, Random Forest, 
adaptive boosting, complement naïve Bayes, and support vector machine. The 
performance of machine learning algorithms were evaluated by the area under the 
receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC), sensitivity, specificity, 
accuracy and F score. Results: 649 TBI patients from the MIMIC-III database were 
included with an ARDS incidence of 49.5%. The random forest performed the best 
in predicting ARDS in the training cohort with an AUC of 1.000. The XGBoost and 
AdaBoost ranked the second and the third with an AUC of 0.989 and 0.815 in the 
training cohort. The random forest still performed the best in predicting ARDS 
in the validation cohort with an AUC of 0.652. AdaBoost and XGBoost ranked the 
second and the third with an AUC of 0.631 and 0.620 in the validation cohort. 
Several mutual top features in the random forest and AdaBoost were discovered 
including age, initial systolic blood pressure and heart rate, Abbreviated 
Injury Score chest, white blood cells, platelets, and international normalized 
ratio. Conclusions: The random forest and AdaBoost based models have stable and 
good performance for predicting ARDS in TBI patients. These models could help 
clinicians to evaluate the risk of ARDS in early stages after TBI and 
consequently adjust treatment decisions.

OBJECTIVE: Hyperlactatemia is likely to occur among patients with acute 
pancreatitis (AP). Sodium bicarbonate (SB) therapy could be applied to correct 
potential detrimental acidic disturbances, but the exact impact of SB treatment 
is unknown. This study aims to investigate the impact of SB on AP patients 
complicated with hyperlactatemia.
METHODS: The study was conducted based on the database named Medical Information 
Mart for Intensive Care-IV (MIMIC-IV). Propensity matching (PSM) and inverse 
probability weighting (IPTW) were used to balance the baseline differences. 
Multivariate regression and marginal structural Cox models were performed to 
investigate the association between SB and multiple outcomes.
RESULTS: Three hundred fifty-three AP patients with hyperlactatemia (initial 
serum lactate, >2.0 mmol/L) were extracted from the MIMIC-IV database. We found 
that SB treatment was significantly associated with worse multi-outcomes of AP 
patients with hyperlactatemia (in-hospital mortality: hazard ratio, 2.46; 95% 
confidence interval, 1.38-4.39; P < 0.01). Further analysis through marginal 
structural Cox models showed that SB had adverse impact on in-hospital prognosis 
of patients with severe lactic acidosis (pH < 7.15,lactate > 2.0 mmol/L).
CONCLUSION: Sodium bicarbonate might not be an appropriate treatment for AP 
patients with hyperlactatemia (lactate > 2.0 mmol/L) or with severe lactic 
acidosis (pH < 7.15, lactate > 2.0 mmol/L).

BACKGROUND: Cardiac arrest (CA) is a common event in the intensive care unit 
(ICU), which seriously threatens the prognosis of patients. Therefore, it is 
crucial to determine a simple and effective clinical indicator to judge the 
prognosis of patients after a CA for later treatments. The purpose of this study 
was to investigate the relationship between the lactate dehydrogenase to albumin 
ratio (LAR) and the prognosis of patients after a CA.
METHODS: The clinical data of participants was obtained from the Medical 
Information Mart for Intensive Care IV (MIMIC-IV, v2.0; 2008 to 2019). According 
to the 30-day prognosis, patients were divided into a survivors group (n = 216) 
and a non-survivors group (n = 304). The optimal LAR threshold was determined 
using restricted cubic spline (RCS), which divided patients into a high LAR 
group (  ≥  15.50, n = 257) and a low LAR group (  <  15.50, n = 263). The ICU 
hospitalization and 30-day accumulative survival curves of the two groups were 
plotted following the Kaplan-Meier survival analysis. Multivariate Cox 
regression was used to analyze the relationship between the LAR and the 
prognosis of CA patients. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves were 
drawn to evaluate the predictive efficacy of the LAR on 30-day all-cause 
mortality, and sensitivity analysis was used to check the reliability of the 
findings.
RESULTS: A total of 520 patients with CA were enrolled and the 30-day mortality 
was 58.46%. The LAR in the non-survivors group was higher than in the survivors 
group. The RCS showed a linear trend relationship between the LAR and the 
mortality risk in patients during their ICU stay and 30 days; moreover, as the 
LAR increased, so did the risk of mortality. The Kaplan-Meier survival curve 
showed that compared with the low LAR group, the cumulative survival rates of 
ICU hospitalization and 30 days were lower in the high LAR group among CA 
patients (p  <  0.001). Multivariate Cox regression analysis showed that an 
elevated LAR (  ≥  15.50) was an independent risk factor for mortality during 
ICU stay and 30 days (p  <  0.005). ROC analysis suggested that the LAR was 
superior to the sequential organ failure assessment (SOFA) score in predicting 
the 30-day all-cause mortality in CA patients (area under the curve (AUC) = 
0.676, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.629-0.723). To verify the reliability of 
our findings, we performed sensitivity analyses and found that the findings were 
reliable.
CONCLUSIONS: An elevated LAR might be a predictor of mortality in patients 
following a CA during ICU hospitalization and 30 days, thereby it can be used to 
provide a reference for the clinical management of these patients.

Assessing illness severity in the intensive care unit (ICU) is crucial for early 
prediction of deterioration and prognosis. Traditional prognostic scores often 
treat organ systems separately, overlooking the body's interconnected nature. 
Network physiology offers a new approach to understanding these complex 
interactions. This study used the concept of transfer entropy (TE) to measure 
information flow between heart rate (HR), respiratory rate (RR), and capillary 
oxygen saturation ([Formula: see text]) in critically ill patients with sepsis, 
hypothesizing that TE between these signals would correlate with disease 
outcome. The retrospective cohort study utilized the Medical Information Mart 
for Intensive Care III Clinical Database, including patients who met Sepsis-3 
criteria on admission and had 30 min of continuous HR, RR, and [Formula: see 
text] data. TE between the signals was calculated to create physiological 
network maps. Cox regression assessed the relationship between cardiorespiratory 
network indices and both deterioration [Sequential Organ Failure Assessment 
(SOFA) score increase of ≥2 points at 48 h] and 30-day mortality. Among 164 
patients, higher information flow from [Formula: see text] to HR [TE ([Formula: 
see text] → HR)] and reciprocal flow between HR and RR [TE (RR → HR) and TE (HR 
→ RR)] were linked to reduced mortality, independent of age, mechanical 
ventilation, SOFA score, and comorbidity. Reductions in TE (HR → RR), TE (RR → 
HR), TE ([Formula: see text] → RR), and TE ([Formula: see text] → HR) were 
associated with an increased risk of 48-h deterioration. After adjustment for 
potential confounders, only TE (HR → RR) and TE (RR → HR) remained statistically 
significant. The study confirmed that physiological network mapping using 
routine signals in patients with sepsis could indicate illness severity and that 
higher TE values were generally associated with improved outcomes.NEW & 
NOTEWORTHY This study adopts an integrative approach through physiological 
network analysis to investigate sepsis, with the goal of identifying differences 
in information transfer between physiological signals in sepsis survivors versus 
nonsurvivors. We found that greater information flow between heart rate, 
respiratory rate, and capillary oxygen saturation was associated with reduced 
mortality, independent of age, disease severity, and comorbidities. In addition, 
reduced information transfer was linked to an increased risk of 48-h 
deterioration in patients with sepsis.

OBJECTIVE: To predict the 28-day mortality of critically ill, elderly patients 
with colorectal cancer (CRC) using five machine learning approaches.
METHODS: Data were extracted from the eICU Collaborative Research Database 
(eICU-CRD) (version 2.0) for a training cohort and from the Medical Information 
Mart for Intensive Care-IV (MIMIC-IV) and Wuhan Union hospital for validation 
cohorts. Clinical information (i.e., demographics; initial laboratory tests; 
vital signs; outcomes) were collected. Five machine learning algorithms 
(LightGBM, decision tree, XGBoost, random forest, and ensemble model) and a 
logistic regression were applied for the prediction of 28-day mortality.
RESULTS: Overall, 693 patients were included from the eICU cohort, 181 patients 
from the MIMIC-IV cohort and 95 from the Wuhan Union cohort. Among the six 
machine learning models, the ensemble model exhibited the best predictive 
ability (AUC, 0.86), followed by random forest (AUC, 0.83) and LightGBM (AUC, 
0.82) in the training cohort. The models also obtained the good predictive 
performance for the 28-day mortality in the validation cohorts.
CONCLUSIONS: We showed that machine learning algorithms can be used for the 
28-day mortality prediction in critically ill, elderly patients with CRC.

BACKGROUND: Cancer causes a serious health burden on patients worldwide. Chronic 
low-level inflammation plays a key role in tumorigenesis and prognosis. However, 
the role of the red blood cell distribution width (RDW)-to-albumin (RA) ratio in 
cancer mortality remains unclear.
METHODS: In this retrospective cohort study, we collected clinical information 
from cancer patients from the Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care III 
(MIMIC-III) version 1.4 database and then calculated RA by dividing RDW by 
albumin concentration. The primary outcome was 30 days mortality, while 
secondary outcomes were 90 days and 1 year mortality. Next, we adopted Cox 
regression models to calculate hazard ratios (HR) together with 95% confidence 
intervals (CI) for all-cause mortalities associated with the RA ratio.
RESULTS: For 30 days mortality, the HR (95% CI) for the high RA ratio (≥5.51) 
was 2.17 [95CI% (1.87-2.51); p = <0.0001], compared with the low RA ratio 
(<5.51). In Model 2, we adjusted sex and age and obtained HR (95% CI) of 2.17 
[95CI% (1.87-2.52); p = <0.0001] for the high RA ratio (≥5.51) group, compared 
to that in the low RA ratio (<5.51). In Model 3, adjusting for age, sex, anion 
gap, hematocrit, white blood cell count, congestive heart failure, SOFA, liver 
disease, and renal failure resulted in HR (95% CI) of 1.74 [95CI% (1.48-2.04); 
p = <0.0001] for the high RA ratio (≥5.51) relative to the low RA ratio (<5.51). 
We also analyzed common diseases in cancer patients but found no significant 
association.
CONCLUSION: To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study demonstrating 
that increased RA ratio is independently associated with increased all-cause 
mortality in cancer patients.

BACKGROUND: The purpose of this study was to develop a nomogram for predicting 
in-hospital mortality in cirrhotic patients with acute kidney injury (AKI) in 
order to identify patients with a high risk of in-hospital death early.
METHODS: This study collected data on cirrhotic patients with AKI from 2008 to 
2019 using the Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care IV. Multivariate 
logistic regression was used to identify confounding factors related to 
in-hospital mortality, which were then integrated into the nomogram. The 
concordance index (C-Index) was used to evaluate the accuracy of the model 
predictions. The area under the curve (AUC) and decision curve analysis (DCA) 
was used to assess the predictive performance and clinical utility of the 
nomogram.
RESULTS: The final study population included 886 cirrhotic patients with AKI, 
and 264 (29.8%) died in the hospital. After multivariate logistic regression, 
age, gender, cerebrovascular disease, heart rate, respiration rate, temperature, 
oxygen saturation, hemoglobin, blood urea nitrogen, serum creatinine, 
international normalized ratio, bilirubin, urine volume, and sequential organ 
failure assessment score were predictive factors of in-hospital mortality. In 
addition, the nomogram showed good accuracy in estimating the in-hospital 
mortality of patients. The calibration plots showed the best agreement with the 
actual presence of in-hospital mortality in patients. In addition, the AUC and 
DCA curves showed that the nomogram has good prediction accuracy and clinical 
value.
CONCLUSIONS: We have created a prognostic nomogram for predicting in-hospital 
death in cirrhotic patients with AKI, which may facilitate timely intervention 
to improve prognosis in these patients.

Background: Present researches exploring the prognostic value of calcium 
concentration are undermined by sample size and study design. Our study 
investigated the association of both total calcium (tCa) and ionized Ca (iCa) to 
short- and long-term mortality and other outcomes in post-cardiovascular surgery 
(PCS) patients admitted to intensive care unit (ICU) from two large public data 
sets. Methods: The Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care III (MIMIC-III) 
database and the eICU Collaborative Research Database (eICU) were inspected to 
identify PCS patients. The primary outcome was 28-day mortality. Multivariate 
regression was used to elucidate the relationship between calcium concentration 
and outcomes. The propensity score estimation was performed to validate our 
findings. Results: A total of 6122 and 914 patients were included from the MIMIC 
III and eICU data sets, respectively. The groups with the most patients were the 
mild hypo-iCa and hypo-tCa groups. The mild hypo-iCa group showed significant 
association with worse short-term and long-term prognosis, less use of 
ventilation, longer ICU and hospital stay, and more incidence of 7-day acute 
kidney injury. Conclusions: The mild hypo-iCa (0.9-1.15 mmol/L) within the first 
day of admission to the ICU could serve as an independent prognosis factor for 
PCS patients.

Previous studies have shown that lactate/albumin ratio (LAR) can be used as a 
prognostic biomarker to independently predict the mortality of sepsis and severe 
heart failure. However, the role of LAR as an independent prognostic factor in 
all-cause mortality in patients with acute respiratory failure (ARF) remains to 
be clarified. Therefore, we retrospectively analyzed 2170 patients with ARF in 
Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care Database III from 2001 to 2012. By 
drawing the receiver operating characteristic curve, LAR shows a better 
predictive value in predicting the 30-day mortality of ARF patients (AUC: 
0.646), which is higher than that of albumin (AUC: 0.631) or lactate (AUC: 
0.616) alone, and even higher than SOFA score(AUC: 0.642). COX regression 
analysis and Kaplan-Meier curve objectively and intuitively show that high LAR 
is a risk factor for patients with ARF, which is positively correlated with 
all-cause mortality. As an easy-to-obtain and objective biomarker, LAR deserves 
further verification by multi-center prospective studies.

BACKGROUND: This study aims to establish the individual contributions of blood 
pressure variability (BPV) indexes, categorized into overall and linked 
variability, to mortality following intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH) by examining 
the risk factors.
METHODS: Patients with spontaneous ICH (n = 1,036) were identified with valid 
blood pressures (BP) from the first 24-h systolic BP records in the Medical 
Information Mart for Intensive Care IV version 2.2 database (MIMIC IV). 
Information on the baseline characteristics, including age, sex, initial Glasgow 
Coma Scale (GCS) and National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale (NIHSS) scores, 
ICH location, Charlson comorbidity index score, and presence of diabetes with or 
without complications, were collected. Three indexes of BPV-range, standard 
deviation (SD), and generalized BPV (GBPV)-were calculated using the first 24-h 
systolic BPs. An automated stepwise variable-selection procedure was used to 
develop the final logistic model for predicting in-hospital mortality.
RESULTS: Out of 1,036 patients, 802 (77.4%) survived and were discharged after 
spontaneous ICH. Factors associated with mortality included age; male sex; ICH 
in the brainstem, ventricle, or multiple locations; low GCS score (< 9); high 
NIHSS score (> 20); and diabetes with complications. Mean systolic BP, SD, and 
GBPV were also linked to mortality. Higher GBPV notably increased the risk of 
in-hospital death, with an odds ratio of 3.21 (95% confidence interval, 2.10 to 
4.97) for every + 10 mmHg/h change in GBPV.
CONCLUSIONS: This study underscores the additional impact of GBPV, herein linked 
to BPV, on mortality following ICH, providing further insights into the 
management of blood pressure in the early stages of ICH treatment.

The present study aimed to explore the association between the 
neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio (NLR) and prognosis of critically ill chronic 
heart failure patients. The records of 5298 patients who met the inclusion 
criteria were extracted from the Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care IV 
database. The primary outcome was 30-days all-cause mortality and the secondary 
outcome was 90-days all-cause mortality. Multivariable logistic regression 
analysis was performed to examine the relationship between NLR and 30-days 
mortality. Subgroup analysis was carried out to identify whether the association 
between NLR and 30-days mortality differed across various subgroups. For 30-days 
mortality, after adjusting for multiple confounders, the odds ratio (OR) (95% 
confidence interval [CI]) for the second (NLR 4.0-8.4) and the third (NLR ≥8.4) 
tertiles were 1.52 (1.13-2.03) and 2.53 (1.92-3.34), respectively, compared with 
the first tertile (NLR <4.0). As for 90-days mortality, the OR for the second 
(NLR 4.0-8.4) was 1.34 (1.07-1.67) and 2.23 (1.81-2.76) for the third (NLR ≥8.4) 
tertiles compared with the reference (NLR<4.0). The interactions between the 
sepsis subgroup and 30-days mortality were significant. Our study concluded that 
the NLR was an independent predictor of 30- and 90-days mortality for critically 
ill patients with chronic heart failure.

OBJECTIVE: Heart rate serves as a critical prognostic factor in heart failure 
(HF) patients. We hypothesise that elevated heart rate in critically ill HF 
patients on discharge from the intensive care unit (ICU) could be linked to 
adverse outcomes.
DESIGN: A single-centre retrospective cohort study.
SETTING: This study used data collected between 2008 and 2019 from the Medical 
Information Mart for Intensive Care IV (V.2.0) Database.
PARTICIPANTS: From the 76 943 ICU stays, we enrolled 2365 patients in this 
study.
PRIMARY AND SECONDARY OUTCOME MEASURES: We observed correlations between 
in-hospital mortality and ICU discharge heart rate of 83.56±15.81 beats per 
minute (bpm) (survivors) vs 93.84±17.28 bpm (non-survivors, p<0.001). Total 
mortality showed similar trends, with 83.67±15.36 bpm (survivors) vs 
85.23±17.25 bpm (non-survivors, p=0.027), as did ICU readmissions at 
83.55±15.77 bpm (non-readmitted) vs 88.64±17.49 bpm (readmitted, p<0.001).
RESULTS: Given multivariate analysis, the ICU discharge heart rate strongly 
predicted in-hospital mortality (HR 1.032 (95% CI 1.022 to 1.041), p<0.001), 
total mortality (HR 1.008 (95% CI 1.004 to 1.013), p<0.001) and ICU readmission 
(HR 1.018 (95% CI 1.010 to 1.025), p<0.001). Patients with an ICU discharge 
heart rate>90 bpm demonstrated significantly higher in-hospital mortality (HR 
2.639 (95% CI 1.898 to 3.669), p<0.001), total mortality (HR 1.342 (95% CI 1.163 
to 1.550), p<0.001) and ICU readmission rates (HR 1.781 (95% CI 1.413 to 2.243), 
p<0.001).
CONCLUSION: The findings suggest that HF patients with an elevated heart rate 
(>90 bpm) at ICU discharge are more likely to experience increased in-hospital 
mortality, total mortality and ICU readmissions, indicating potential negative 
outcomes.

Introduction: Liver cirrhosis is caused by the development of various acute and 
chronic liver diseases. Esophageal varices is a common and serious complication 
of liver cirrhosis during decompensation. Despite the development of various 
treatments, the prognosis for liver cirrhosis with esophageal varices (LCEV) 
remains poor. We aimed to establish and validate a nomogram for predicting 
in-hospital death in LCEV patients. Methods: Data on LCEV patients were 
extracted from the Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care III and IV 
(MIMIC-III and MIMIC-IV) database. The patients from MIMIC-III were randomly 
divided into training and validation cohorts. Training cohort was used for 
establishing the model, validation and MIMIC-IV cohorts were used for 
validation. The independent prognostic factors for LCEV patients were determined 
using the least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) method and 
forward stepwise logistic regression. We then constructed a nomogram to predict 
the in-hospital death of LCEV patients. Multiple indicators were used to 
validate the nomogram, including the area under the receiver operating 
characteristic curve (AUC), calibration curve, Hosmer-Lemeshow test, integrated 
discrimination improvement (IDI), net reclassification index (NRI), and decision 
curve analysis (DCA). Results: Nine independent prognostic factors were 
identified by using LASSO and stepwise regressions: age, Elixhauser score, anion 
gap, sodium, albumin, bilirubin, international normalized ratio, vasopressor 
use, and bleeding. The nomogram was then constructed and validated. The AUC 
value of the nomogram was 0.867 (95% CI = 0.832-0.904) in the training cohort, 
0.846 (95% CI = 0.790-0.896) in the validation cohort and 0.840 (95% CI = 
0.807-0.872) in the MIMIC-IV cohort. High AUC values indicated the good 
discriminative ability of the nomogram, while the calibration curves and the 
Hosmer-Lemeshow test results demonstrated that the nomogram was well-calibrated. 
Improvements in NRI and IDI values suggested that our nomogram was superior to 
MELD-Na, CAGIB, and OASIS scoring system. DCA curves indicated that the nomogram 
had good value in clinical applications. Conclusion: We have established the 
first prognostic nomogram for predicting the in-hospital death of LCEV patients. 
The nomogram is easy to use, performs well, and can be used to guide clinical 
practice, but further external prospective validation is still required.

On average, more than 5 million patients are admitted to intensive care units 
(ICUs) in the US, with mortality rates ranging from 10 to 29%. The acuity state 
of patients in the ICU can quickly change from stable to unstable, sometimes 
leading to life-threatening conditions. Early detection of deteriorating 
conditions can assist in more timely interventions and improved survival rates. 
While Artificial Intelligence (AI)-based models show potential for assessing 
acuity in a more granular and automated manner, they typically use mortality as 
a proxy of acuity in the ICU. Furthermore, these methods do not determine the 
acuity state of a patient (i.e., stable or unstable), the transition between 
acuity states, or the need for life-sustaining therapies. In this study, we 
propose APRICOT-M (Acuity Prediction in Intensive Care Unit-Mamba), a 
1M-parameter state space-based neural network to predict acuity state, 
transitions, and the need for life-sustaining therapies in real-time among ICU 
patients. The model integrates ICU data in the preceding four hours (including 
vital signs, laboratory results, assessment scores, and medications) and patient 
characteristics (age, sex, race, and comorbidities) to predict the acuity 
outcomes in the next four hours. Our state space-based model can process sparse 
and irregularly sampled data without manual imputation, thus reducing the noise 
in input data and increasing inference speed. The model was trained on data from 
107,473 patients (142,062 ICU admissions) from 55 hospitals between 2014-2017 
and validated externally on data from 74,901 patients (101,356 ICU admissions) 
from 143 hospitals. Additionally, it was validated temporally on data from 
12,927 patients (15,940 ICU admissions) from one hospital in 2018-2019 and 
prospectively on data from 215 patients (369 ICU admissions) from one hospital 
in 2021-2023. Three datasets were used for training and evaluation: the 
University of Florida Health (UFH) dataset, the electronic ICU Collaborative 
Research Database (eICU), and the Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care 
(MIMIC)-IV dataset. APRICOT-M significantly outperforms the baseline acuity 
assessment, Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (SOFA), for mortality prediction 
in both external (AUROC 0.95 CI: 0.94-0.95 compared to 0.78 CI: 0.78-0.79) and 
prospective (AUROC 0.99 CI: 0.97-1.00 compared to 0.80 CI: 0.65-0.92) cohorts, 
as well as for instability prediction (external AUROC 0.75 CI: 0.74-0.75 
compared to 0.51 CI: 0.51-0.51, and prospective AUROC 0.69 CI: 0.64-0.74 
compared to 0.53 CI: 0.50-0.57). This tool has the potential to help clinicians 
make timely interventions by predicting the transition between acuity states and 
decision-making on life-sustaining within the next four hours in the ICU.

To introduce Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care (MIMIC) database and 
elaborate the approach of critically emergent research with big data based on 
the feature of MIMIC and updated studies both domestic and overseas, we put 
forward the feasibility and necessity of introducing medical big data to 
research in emergency. Then we discuss the role of MIMIC database in emergency 
clinical study, as well as the principles and key notes of experimental design 
and implementation under the medical big data circumstance. The implementation 
of MIMIC database in emergency medical research provides a brand new field for 
the early diagnosis, risk warning and prognosis of critical illness, however 
there are also limitations. To meet the era of big data, emergency medical 
database which is in accordance with our national condition is needed, which 
will provide new energy to the development of emergency medicine.

OBJECTIVE: To develop and validate a model for predicting death risk in septic 
shock patients using LASSO-Logistic methods.
METHODS: A retrospective cohort study was conducted. Based on the open-source 
database Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care-III v1.4 (MIMIC-III v1.4), 
the septic shock patients meeting the Sepsis-3 criteria were included, and the 
data on demographic characteristics, major signs, laboratory examinations, 
hospitalization, and outcomes were extracted. Predictive variables were selected 
by LASSO regression and predictive models were derived using Logistic 
regression. The calibration of the model was evaluated using the Hosmer-Lemeshow 
test and discrimination was evaluated using the receiver operator characteristic 
curve (ROC curve).
RESULTS: A total of 693 patients with septic shock were enrolled, in which 445 
patients survived and 248 patients dead within 30 days and the mortality was 
35.8%. Logistic regression model was constructed according to nine predictive 
variables and outcome variables screened by LASSO regression method, which 
showed that advanced age, Elixhauser index, blood lactic acid (Lac), K+ level 
and mechanical ventilation were associated with increased 30-day mortality [odds 
ratio (OR) and 95% confidence interval (95%CI) was 1.023 (1.010-1.037), 1.047 
(1.022-1.074), 1.213 (1.133-1.305), 2.241 (1.664-3.057), 2.165 (1.433-3.301), 
respectively, all P < 0.01], and reduced systolic blood pressure (SBP), 
diastolic blood pressure (DBP), body temperature, and pulse oxygen saturation 
(SpO2) were also associated with increased 30-day mortality [OR (95%CI) was 
0.974 (0.957-0.990), 0.972 (0.950-0.994), 0.693 (0.556-0.857), 0.971 
(0.949-0.992), respectively, all P < 0.05]. The calibration curve showed that 
the predicted risk of septic shock death risk prediction model had good 
agreement with the real situation. ROC curve analysis showed that the area under 
the ROC curve (AUC) of the prediction model was 0.839 (95%CI was 0.803-0.876), 
which could distinguish patients at risk of death from those at risk of 
survival.
CONCLUSIONS: The septic shock death risk prediction model has a good ability to 
identify the 30-day mortality risk of septic shock patients, including nine 
hospital readily variables (age, Elixhauser index, mechanical ventilation, Lac, 
K+, SBP, DBP, body temperature and SpO2). The model could be used by clinicians 
to calculate the risk of death in septic shock individuals.

BACKGROUND: Severe acute pancreatitis (SAP) has a mortality of 30% with no 
current targeted therapy. The potential protective effect of insulin on AP has 
been reported and needs to be confirmed. Thus, we aim to examine the effect of 
insulin treatment on the outcome of AP patients.
METHODS: A retrospective study was performed using data from the Medical 
Information Mart for Intensive Care (MIMIC) database. Kruskal-Wallis test, 
t-tests, and Pearson's chi-squared test were used to compare differences between 
groups. Propensity score matching and further nearest neighbor matching were 
used to construct a matched cohort. Cox proportional hazards regression 
analyses, logistic regression analyses, and the doubly robust estimation method 
were used to assess the relationship between insulin use and mortality.
RESULTS: Nine hundred patients were enrolled in the final analysis. Insulin was 
associated with better outcomes in AP patients admitted to ICU, and could act as 
an independent predictor for 30-day mortality (HR = 0.36, 95% CI = 0.24-0.55). 
Subgroup analysis showed that AP patients with heart failure or without kidney 
disease or respiratory failure may not benefit from insulin treatment.
CONCLUSIONS: Insulin treatment is independently associated with lower 30-day 
mortality in AP patients, except for those with heart failure or without kidney 
disease or respiratory failure.

OBJECTIVE: Early fluid resuscitation is crucial in the treatment of sepsis, yet 
the optimal dosage remains debated. This study aims to determine the optimal 
multi-stage fluid resuscitation dosage for sepsis patients.
METHODS: We propose a reinforcement learning algorithm with neural networks 
(RL-NN), utilizing the flexibility of deep learning architectures to mitigate 
model misspecification. We use cross-validation and random search for 
hyperparameter tuning to further enhance model robustness and generalization.
RESULTS: Simulation results demonstrate that our method outperforms existing 
methods in terms of both the percentage of correctly classified optimal 
treatments and the predicted counterfactual mean outcome. Applying this method 
to the sepsis cohort from the Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care III 
(MIMIC-III), we recommend that all sepsis patients receive adequate fluid 
resuscitation (≥ 30 mL/kg) within the first 3 h of admission to the MICU. Our 
approach is expected to significantly reduce the mean SOFA score by 23.71%, 
enhancing patient outcomes.
CONCLUSION: Our RL-NN method offers an accurate, real-time approach to 
optimizing sepsis treatment and aligns with the 'Surviving Sepsis Campaign' 
guidelines. It also has the potential to be integrated with existing electronic 
health record (EHR) systems, guiding clinical decision-making and thereby 
improving patient prognosis.

Backgrounds: Anticoagulation in sepsis-associated disseminated intravascular 
coagulation (DIC) remains uncertain. The aim of this study was to investigate 
whether unfractioned heparin (UFH) could improve clinical outcomes in patients 
with sepsis-induced coagulopathy (SIC). Methods: Septic patients with SIC were 
identified from the Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care (MIMIC)-III 
database. Cox-proportional hazards model, logistic regression model and linear 
regression were used to assess the associations between UFH administration and 
28-day mortality, hospital mortality, occurrence of bleeding complications and 
length of stay, respectively. Propensity score matching (PSM) analysis was used 
to match the imbalance between patients in the UFH group and the control group. 
Patients were further stratified according to SIC score and Simplified Acute 
Physiology Score II (SAPS II). Results: A total of 1,820 septic patients with 
SIC were included in the data analysis. After PSM, 652 pairs of patients were 
matched between the patients in the UFH group and the control group. UFH was 
significantly associated with reduced 28-day mortality (HR, 0.323, 95% CI, 
0.258-0.406; p < 0.001) and hospital mortality (HR, 0.380, 95% CI, 0.307-0.472; 
p < 0.001) without increasing the risks of intracranial hemorrhage (OR, 1.480, 
95% CI, 0.955-2.294; p = 0.080) or gastrointestinal bleeding (OR, 1.094, 95% CI, 
0.503-2.382; p = 0.820). For subgroup analysis, it didn't change the favorable 
results of UFH on mortality and UFH didn't increase the risk of hemorrhage in 
patients with severe disease. Conclusions: The analysis of MIMIC-III database 
indicated that anticoagulant therapy with UFH may be associated with a survival 
benefit in patients with SIC.

BACKGROUND: To identify the distinct trajectories of the Sequential Organ 
Failure Assessment (SOFA) scores at 72 h for patients with sepsis in the Medical 
Information Mart for Intensive Care (MIMIC)-IV database and determine their 
effects on mortality and adverse clinical outcomes.
METHODS: A retrospective cohort study was carried out involving patients with 
sepsis from the MIMIC-IV database. Group-based trajectory modeling (GBTM) was 
used to identify the distinct trajectory groups for the SOFA scores in patients 
with sepsis in the intensive care unit (ICU). The Cox proportional hazards 
regression model was used to investigate the relationship between the 
longitudinal change trajectory of the SOFA score and mortality and adverse 
clinical outcomes.
RESULTS: A total of 16,743 patients with sepsis were included in the cohort. The 
median survival age was 66 years (interquartile range: 54-76 years). The 7-day 
and 28-day in-hospital mortality were 6.0% and 17.6%, respectively. Five 
different trajectories of SOFA scores according to the model fitting standard 
were determined: group 1 (32.8%), group 2 (30.0%), group 3 (17.6%), group 4 
(14.0%) and group 5 (5.7%). Univariate and multivariate Cox regression analyses 
showed that, for different clinical outcomes, trajectory group 1 was used as the 
reference, while trajectory groups 2-5 were all risk factors associated with the 
outcome (P < 0.001). Subgroup analysis revealed an interaction between the two 
covariates of age and mechanical ventilation and the different trajectory groups 
of patients' SOFA scores (P < 0.05).
CONCLUSION: This approach may help identify various groups of patients with 
sepsis, who may be at different levels of risk for adverse health outcomes, and 
provide subgroups with clinical importance.

Spontaneous intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH) is a prevalent hemorrhagic stroke 
characterized by a significant fatality rate and severe neurological 
impairments. Stress hyperglycemia has been confirmed to have a significant 
prognostic role in a range of diseases. However, studies on the association 
between stress hyperglycemia and the outcome of ICH have not currently been 
reported. Critically ill patients diagnosed with ICH in the Medical Information 
Mart for Intensive Care IV (MIMIC-IV) database were included in our study. 
Logistic regression and Cox regression were used to analyze the correlation 
between stress hyperglycemia and the outcome of ICH. The predictive ability of 
different glucose metrics was demonstrated by the receiver-operating 
characteristic (ROC) curve and was further compared by the integrated 
discrimination improvement (IDI) index. A total of 880 ICH patients in the 
MIMIC-IV database were included in this study. In logistic regression and Cox 
regression, blood glucose level (BGL), glycemic gap (GG), and stress 
hyperglycemia ratio (SHR) were independent predictors of unfavorable outcomes in 
ICH after adjustment for other confounders. The IDI results indicated that the 
5-day maximum stress hyperglycemia ratio had better predictive performance than 
glycemic gap and blood glucose level in-hospital mortality and 1-year mortality, 
and the predictive performance of the 5-day maximum stress hyperglycemia ratio 
was better than that of stress hyperglycemia ratio measured at admission. In the 
age-stratified subgroup analysis, the 5-day maximum stress hyperglycemia ratio 
was more sensitive in predicting long-term outcomes in the young subgroup than 
in the elderly subgroup. The 5-day maximum stress hyperglycemia ratio is 
strongly correlated with an elevated risk of mortality in ICH patients and 
displays a better predictive ability than glycemic gap and blood glucose level 
in the short/long-term prognosis of ICH.

BACKGROUND: Leukocytes play an important role in inflammatory response after a 
traumatic brain injury (TBI). We designed this study to identify TBI phenotypes 
by clustering blood levels of various leukocytes.
METHODS: TBI patients from the Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care-III 
(MIMIC-III) database were included. Blood levels of neutrophils, lymphocytes, 
monocytes, basophils, and eosinophils were collected by analyzing the first 
blood sample within 24 h since admission. Overall, TBI patients were divided 
into clusters following the K-means clustering method using blood levels of five 
types of leukocytes. The correlation between identified clusters and mortality 
was tested by univariate and multivariate logistic regression analyses. The 
Kaplan-Meier method was used to verify the survival difference between 
identified TBI clusters.
RESULTS: A total of 172 (cluster 1), 791 (cluster 2), and 636 (cluster 3) TBI 
patients were divided into three clusters with the following percentages, 10.8%, 
49.5%, and 39.8%, respectively. Cluster 1 had the lowest Glasgow Coma Scale 
(GCS) and the highest Injury Severity Score (ISS) while cluster 2 had the 
highest GCS and the lowest ISS. The mortality rates of the three clusters were 
25.6%, 13.3%, and 18.1%, respectively. The multivariate logistic regression 
indicated that cluster 1 had a higher mortality risk (OR = 2.211, p = 0.003) 
than cluster 2, while cluster 3 did not show a significantly higher mortality 
risk than cluster 2 (OR = 1.285, p = 0.163). Kapan-Meier analysis showed that 
cluster 1 had shorter survival than cluster 2 and cluster 3.
CONCLUSION: Three TBI phenotypes with different inflammatory statuses and 
mortality rates were identified based on blood levels of leukocytes. This 
classification is helpful for physicians to evaluate the prognosis of TBI 
patients.

Sepsis-associated encephalopathy (SAE) is defined as a dysfunction of the 
central nervous system experienced during sepsis with variable clinical 
features. The study aims to identify the prognostic role of urinary ketone 
bodies in relation to clinical outcomes in patients with SAE. The Medical 
Information Mart for Intensive Care III (MIMIC-III) database was used to conduct 
a retrospective cohort study. We recruited 427 patients with SAE admitted to the 
intensive care unit (ICU) from the MIMIC-III database. Patients with SAE were 
divided into a survival group (380 patients) and a non-survival group (47 
patients). We used the Wilcoxon signed-rank test and the multivariate logistic 
regression analysis to analyze the relationship between the level of urinary 
ketone bodies and the clinical prognosis in patients with SAE. The primary 
outcome was the relationship between urinary ketone body levels and 28-day 
mortality of SAE. The secondary outcomes were the relationship between urinary 
ketone body levels and length of ICU stays, Simplified Acute Physiology Score 
II, Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (SOFA), Glasgow Coma Scale, mechanical 
ventilation, renal replacement therapy, and the use of vasopressors. The 28-day 
mortality of patients with SAE was 11.0%. Urinary ketone body levels were not 
significantly associated with the 28-day mortality of patients with SAE. Urinary 
ketone body levels were associated with SOFA score and the use of vasopressors 
in patients with SAE. The SOFA score was an independent risk factor for the 
28-day mortality in patients with SAE. Urinary ketone body levels were 
significantly associated with SOFA score and the use of vasopressors in patients 
with SAE. Furthermore, the SOFA score can predict the prognosis of short-term 
outcomes of patients with SAE. Therefore, we should closely monitor the changes 
of urinary ketone bodies and SOFA score and intervene in time.

DySurv: dynamic deep learning model for survival analysis with conditional 
variational inference.

OBJECTIVE: Machine learning applications for longitudinal electronic health 
records often forecast the risk of events at fixed time points, whereas survival 
analysis achieves dynamic risk prediction by estimating time-to-event 
distributions. Here, we propose a novel conditional variational 
autoencoder-based method, DySurv, which uses a combination of static and 
longitudinal measurements from electronic health records to estimate the 
individual risk of death dynamically.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: DySurv directly estimates the cumulative risk incidence 
function without making any parametric assumptions on the underlying stochastic 
process of the time-to-event. We evaluate DySurv on 6 time-to-event benchmark 
datasets in healthcare, as well as 2 real-world intensive care unit (ICU) 
electronic health records (EHR) datasets extracted from the eICU Collaborative 
Research (eICU) and the Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care database 
(MIMIC-IV).
RESULTS: DySurv outperforms other existing statistical and deep learning 
approaches to time-to-event analysis across concordance and other metrics. It 
achieves time-dependent concordance of over 60% in the eICU case. It is also 
over 12% more accurate and 22% more sensitive than in-use ICU scores like Acute 
Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation (APACHE) and Sequential Organ Failure 
Assessment (SOFA) scores. The predictive capacity of DySurv is consistent and 
the survival estimates remain disentangled across different datasets.
DISCUSSION: Our interdisciplinary framework successfully incorporates deep 
learning, survival analysis, and intensive care to create a novel method for 
time-to-event prediction from longitudinal health records. We test our method on 
several held-out test sets from a variety of healthcare datasets and compare it 
to existing in-use clinical risk scoring benchmarks.
CONCLUSION: While our method leverages non-parametric extensions to deep 
learning-guided estimations of the survival distribution, further deep learning 
paradigms could be explored.

Acute kidney injury (AKI) is commonly present in critically ill patients with 
sepsis. Early prediction of short-term reversibility of AKI is beneficial to 
risk stratification and clinical treatment decision. The study sought to use 
machine learning methods to discriminate between transient and persistent 
sepsis-associated AKI. Septic patients who developed AKI within the first 48 h 
after ICU admission were identified from the Medical Information Mart for 
Intensive Care III database. AKI was classified as transient or persistent 
according to the Acute Disease Quality Initiative workgroup consensus. Five 
prediction models using logistic regression, random forest, support vector 
machine, artificial neural network and extreme gradient boosting were 
constructed, and their performance was evaluated by out-of-sample testing. A 
simplified risk prediction model was also derived based on logistic regression 
and features selected by machine learning algorithms. A total of 5984 septic 
patients with AKI were included, 3805 (63.6%) of whom developed persistent AKI. 
The artificial neural network and logistic regression models achieved the 
highest area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) among the 
five machine learning models (0.76, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.74-0.78). The 
simplified 14-variable model showed adequate discrimination, with the AUC being 
0.76 (95% CI 0.73-0.78). At the optimal cutoff of 0.63, the sensitivity and 
specificity of the simplified model were 63% and 76% respectively. In 
conclusion, a machine learning-based simplified prediction model including 
routine clinical variables could be used to differentiate between transient and 
persistent AKI in critically ill septic patients. An easy-to-use risk calculator 
can promote its widespread application in daily clinical practice.

BACKGROUND: Elderly patients are more likely to suffer from severe ischemic 
stroke (IS) and have worse outcomes, including death and disability. We aimed to 
develop and validate predictive models using novel machine learning algorithms 
for the 3-month mortality in elderly patients with IS admitted to the intensive 
care unit (ICU).
METHODS: We conducted a retrospective cohort study. Data were extracted from 
Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care (MIMIC)-IV and International Stroke 
Perfusion Imaging Registry (INSPIRE) database. Ten machine learning algorithms 
including Categorical Boosting (CatBoost), Random Forest (RF), Support Vector 
Machine (SVM), Neural Network (NN), Gradient Boosting Machine (GBM), K-Nearest 
Neighbors (KNNs), Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP), Naive Bayes (NB), eXtreme 
Gradient Boosting (XGBoost) and Logistic Regression (LR) were used to build the 
models. Performance was measured using area under the curve (AUC) and accuracy. 
Finally, interpretable machine learning (IML) models presenting as Shapley 
additive explanation (SHAP) values were applied for mortality risk prediction.
RESULTS: A total of 1826 elderly patients with IS admitted to the ICU were 
included in the analysis, of whom 624 (34.2%) died, and endovascular treatment 
was performed in 244 patients. After feature selection, a total of eight 
variables, including minimum Glasgow Coma Scale values, albumin, lactate 
dehydrogenase, age, alkaline phosphatase, body mass index, platelets, and types 
of surgery, were finally used for model construction. The AUCs of the CatBoost 
model were 0.737 in the testing set and 0.709 in the external validation set. 
The Brier scores in the training set and testing set were 0.12 and 0.21, 
respectively. The IML of the CatBoost model was performed based on the SHAP 
value and the Local Interpretable Model-Agnostic Explanations method.
CONCLUSION: The CatBoost model had the best predictive performance for 
predicting mortality in elderly patients with IS admitted to the ICU. The IML 
model would further aid in clinical decision-making and timely healthcare 
services by the early identification of high-risk patients.

Purpose: We aimed to investigate the association between the early mean arterial 
pressure (MAP)/norepinephrine equivalent dose (NEQ) index and mortality risk in 
patients with shock on vasopressors and further identify the breakpoint value of 
the MAP/NEQ index for high mortality risk. Methods: Based on the Medical 
Information Mart for Intensive Care IV database, we conducted a retrospective 
cohort study involving 19,539 eligible intensive care unit records assigned to 
three groups (first tertile, second tertile, and third tertile) by different 
MAP/NEQ indexes within 24 h of intensive care unit admission. The study outcomes 
were 7-, 14-, 21-, and 28-day mortality. A Cox model was used to examine the 
risk of mortality following different MAP/NEQ indexes. The receiving operating 
characteristic curve was used to evaluate the predictive ability of the MAP/NEQ 
index. The restricted cubic spline was applied to fit the flexible correlation 
between the MAP/NEQ index and risk of mortality, and segmented regression was 
further used to identify the breakpoint value of the MAP/NEQ index for high 
mortality risk. Results: Multivariate Cox analysis showed that a high MAP/NEQ 
index was independently associated with decreased mortality risks. The areas 
under the receiving operating characteristic curve of the MAP/NEQ index for 
different mortality outcomes were nearly 0.7. The MAP/NEQ index showed an 
L-shaped association with mortality outcomes or mortality risks. Exploration of 
the breakpoint value of the MAP/NEQ index suggested that a MAP/NEQ index less 
than 183 might be associated with a significantly increased mortality risk. 
Conclusions: An early low MAP/NEQ index was indicative of poor prognosis in 
patients with shock on vasopressors.

BACKGROUND: In acute myocardial infarction (AMI), acute hepatic injury is an 
independent risk factor for prognosis and is associated with complex coagulation 
dynamics. This study aims to determine the interaction between acute hepatic 
injury and coagulation dysfunction on outcomes in AMI patients.
METHODS: The Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care (MIMIC-III) database 
was used to identify AMI patients who underwent liver function testing within 24 
h of admission. After ruling out previous hepatic injury, patients were divided 
into the hepatic injury group and the nonhepatic injury group based on whether 
the alanine transaminase (ALT) level at admission was >3 times the upper limit 
of normal (ULN). The primary outcome was intensive care unit (ICU) mortality.
RESULTS: Among 703 AMI patients (67.994% male, median age 65.139 years 
(55.757-76.859)), acute hepatic injury occurred in 15.220% (n = 107). Compared 
with the nonhepatic injury group, patients with hepatic injury had a higher 
Elixhauser comorbidity index (ECI) score (12 (6-18) vs. 7 (1-12), p < 0.001) and 
more severe coagulation dysfunction (85.047% vs. 68.960%, p < 0.001). In 
addition, acute hepatic injury was associated with increased in-hospital 
mortality (odds ratio (OR) = 3.906; 95% CI: 2.053-7.433; p < 0.001), ICU 
mortality (OR = 4.866; 95% CI: 2.489-9.514; p < 0.001), 28-day mortality (OR = 
4.129; 95% CI: 2.215-7.695; p < 0.001) and 90-day mortality (OR = 3.407; 95% CI: 
1.883-6.165; p < 0.001) only in patients with coagulation disorder but not with 
normal coagulation. Unlike patients with coagulation disorder and normal liver, 
patients with both coagulation disorder and acute hepatic injury had greater 
odds of ICU mortality (OR = 8.565; 95% CI: 3.467-21.160; p < 0.001) than those 
with normal coagulation.
CONCLUSIONS: The effects of acute hepatic injury on prognosis are likely to be 
modulated by early coagulation disorder in AMI patients.

Background: Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) is the most widespread and 
life-threatening nosocomial infection in intensive care units (ICUs). The 
duration of antibiotic use is a good predictor of prognosis in patients with 
VAP, but the ideal duration of antibiotic therapy for VAP in critically ill 
patients has not been confirmed. Research is therefore needed into the optimal 
duration of antibiotic use and its impact on VAP. Methods: The Medical 
Information Mart for Intensive Care database included 1,609 patients with VAP. 
Chi-square or Student's t-tests were used to compare groups, and Cox regression 
analysis was used to investigate the factors influencing the prognoses of 
patients with VAP. Nonlinear tests were performed on antibiotic use lasting <7, 
7-10, and >10 days. Significant factors were included in the model for 
sensitivity analysis. For the subgroup analyses, the body mass indexes (BMIs) of 
patients were separated into BMI <30 kg/m2 and BMI ≥30 kg/m2, with the criterion 
of statistical significance set at p < 0.05. Restricted cubic splines were used 
to analyze the relationship between antibiotic use duration and mortality risk 
in patients with VAP. Results: In patients with VAP, the effects of antibiotic 
use duration on the outcomes were nonlinear. Antibiotic use for 7-10 days in 
models 1-3 increased the risk of antibiotic use by 2.6020-, 2.1642-, and 
2.3263-fold relative to for >10 days, respectively. The risks in models 1-3 for 
<7 days were 2.6510-, 1.9933-, and 2.5151-fold higher than those in models with 
>10 days of antibiotic use, respectively. These results were robust across the 
analyses. Conclusions: The duration of antibiotic treatment had a nonlinear 
effect on the prognosis of patients with VAP. Antibiotic use durations of 
<7 days and 7-10 days both presented risks, and the appropriate duration of 
antibiotic use can ensure the good prognosis of patients with VAP.

BACKGROUND: The incidence, mortality, and readmission rates for acute heart 
failure (AHF) are high, and the in-hospital mortality for AHF patients in the 
intensive care unit (ICU) is higher. However, there is currently no method to 
accurately predict the mortality of AHF patients.
METHODS: The Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care Ⅳ (MIMIC-Ⅳ) database 
was used to perform a retrospective study. Patients meeting the inclusion 
criteria were identified from the MIMIC-Ⅳ database and randomly divided into a 
training set (n = 3,580, 70%) and a validation set (n = 1,534, 30%). The 
variates collected include demographic data, vital signs, comorbidities, 
laboratory test results, and treatment information within 24 hours of ICU 
admission. By using the least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) 
regression model in the training set, variates that affect the in-hospital 
mortality of AHF patients were screened. Subsequently, in the training set, five 
common machine learning (ML) algorithms were applied to construct models using 
variates selected by LASSO to predict the in-hospital mortality of AHF patients. 
The predictive ability of the models was evaluated for sensitivity, specificity, 
accuracy, the area under the curve of receiver operating characteristics, and 
clinical net benefit in the validation set. To obtain a model with the best 
predictive ability, the predictive ability of common scoring systems was 
compared with the best ML model.
RESULTS: Among the 5,114 patients, in-hospital mortality was 12.5%. Comparing 
the area under the curve, the XGBoost model had the best predictive ability 
among all ML models, and the XGBoost model was chosen as the final model for its 
higher net benefit. Its predictive ability was superior to common scoring 
systems.
CONCLUSIONS: The XGBoost model can effectively predict the in-hospital mortality 
of AHF patients admitted to the ICU, which may assist clinicians in precise 
management and early intervention for patients with AHF to reduce mortality.

We aimed to develop and validate multimodal ICU patient prognosis models that 
combine clinical parameters data and chest X-ray (CXR) images. A total of 3798 
subjects with clinical parameters and CXR images were extracted from the Medical 
Information Mart for Intensive Care IV (MIMIC-IV) database and an external 
hospital (the test set). The primary outcome was 30-day mortality after ICU 
admission. Automated machine learning (AutoML) and convolutional neural networks 
(CNNs) were used to construct single-modal models based on clinical parameters 
and CXR separately. An early fusion approach was used to integrate both 
modalities (clinical parameters and CXR) into a multimodal model named PrismICU. 
Compared to the single-modal models, i.e., the clinical parameter model 
(AUC = 0.80, F1-score = 0.43) and the CXR model (AUC = 0.76, F1-score = 0.45) 
and the scoring system APACHE II (AUC = 0.83, F1-score = 0.77), PrismICU 
(AUC = 0.95, F1 score = 0.95) showed improved performance in predicting the 
30-day mortality in the validation set. In the test set, PrismICU (AUC = 0.82, 
F1-score = 0.61) was also better than the clinical parameters model (AUC = 0.72, 
F1-score = 0.50), CXR model (AUC = 0.71, F1-score = 0.36), and APACHE II 
(AUC = 0.62, F1-score = 0.50). PrismICU, which integrated clinical parameters 
data and CXR images, performed better than single-modal models and the existing 
scoring system. It supports the potential of multimodal models based on 
structured data and imaging in clinical management.

BACKGROUND: This study aimed to create a nomogram using the model for end-stage 
liver disease (MELD) that can better predict the risk of 28-day mortality in 
patients with bleeding esophageal varices.
METHODS: Data on patients with bleeding esophageal varices were retrospectively 
collected from the Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care database. 
Variables were selected using the least absolute shrinkage and selection 
operator logistic regression model and were used to construct a prognostic 
nomogram. The nomogram was evaluated against the MELD model using various 
methods, including receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis, 
calibration plotting, net reclassification improvement (NRI), integrated 
discrimination improvement (IDI), and decision curve analysis (DCA).
RESULTS: A total of 280 patients were included in the study. The patient's use 
of vasopressin and norepinephrine, respiratory rate, temperature, mean 
corpuscular volume, and MELD score were included in the nomogram. The area under 
the ROC curve, NRI, IDI, and DCA of the nomogram indicated that it performs 
better than the MELD alone.
CONCLUSION: A nomogram was created that outperformed the MELD score in 
forecasting the risk of 28-day mortality in individuals with bleeding esophageal 
varices.

OBJECTIVE: The primary objective is to develop an automated method for detecting 
patients that are ready for discharge from intensive care.
DESIGN: We used two datasets of routinely collected patient data to test and 
improve on a set of previously proposed discharge criteria.
SETTING: Bristol Royal Infirmary general intensive care unit (GICU).
PATIENTS: Two cohorts derived from historical datasets: 1870 intensive care 
patients from GICU in Bristol, and 7592 from Medical Information Mart for 
Intensive Care (MIMIC)-III.
RESULTS: In both cohorts few successfully discharged patients met all of the 
discharge criteria. Both a random forest and a logistic classifier, trained 
using multiple-source cross-validation, demonstrated improved performance over 
the original criteria and generalised well between the cohorts. The classifiers 
showed good agreement on which features were most predictive of 
readiness-for-discharge, and these were generally consistent with clinical 
experience. By weighting the discharge criteria according to feature importance 
from the logistic model we showed improved performance over the original 
criteria, while retaining good interpretability.
CONCLUSIONS: Our findings indicate the feasibility of the proposed approach to 
ready-for-discharge classification, which could complement other risk models of 
specific adverse outcomes in a future decision support system. Avenues for 
improvement to produce a clinically useful tool are identified.

BACKGROUND: We aimed to explore the impact of aspirin use on the risk of 
readmission and mortality in patients with myocardial infarction and pneumonia.
METHODS: This was a cohort study including 703 participants with severe 
pneumonia and myocardial infarction included in the Medical Information Mart for 
Intensive Care (MIMIC)-III and the MIMIC-IV. Kaplan-Meier survival analysis was 
used to show the readmission and survival probability of patients with or 
without aspirin. In addition, univariate and multivariable models were used to 
investigate the impact of aspirin on the risk of readmission or mortality of 
patients. Subgroup analyses were conducted in terms of age, gender, antibiotic 
use, vancomycin and ampicillin use.
RESULTS: Average follow-up was one year, 22% of patients experienced 
readmission, and 72% patients survived. After the confounders were adjusted for, 
a 0.46-fold decreased risk of readmission (hazard ratio [HR]=0.46, 95% 
confidence interval [CI]: 0.27-0.78) and a 0.58-fold decreased risk of one-year 
mortality (HR=0.56, 95%CI: 0.42-0.82) were observed favoring aspirin use. 
Subgroup analyses revealed that aspirin was, however, associated with an 
increased risk of mortality in patients not receiving vancomycin treatment 
(HR=1.79, 95%CI: 1.08-2.97).
CONCLUSIONS: Our findings suggest that clinicians should consider using aspirin 
in patients with severe myocardial infarction and pneumonia was recommended.

INTRODUCTION: About 42 million surgeries are performed annually in the USA. 
While the postoperative mortality is less than 2%, 12% of all patients in the 
high-risk surgery group account for 80% of postoperative deaths. New onset of 
haemodynamic instability is common in surgical patients and its delayed 
treatment leads to increased morbidity and mortality. The goal of this proposal 
is to develop, validate and test real-time intraoperative risk prediction tools 
based on clinical data and high-fidelity physiological waveforms to predict 
haemodynamic instability during surgery.
METHODS AND ANALYSIS: We will initiate our work using an existing annotated 
intraoperative database from the University of California Irvine, including 
clinical and high-fidelity waveform data. These data will be used for the 
training and development of the machine learning model (Carnegie Mellon 
University) that will then be tested on prospectively collected database 
(University of California Los Angeles). Simultaneously, we will use existing 
knowledge of haemodynamic instability patterns derived from our intensive care 
unit cohorts, medical information mart for intensive care II data, University of 
California Irvine data and animal studies to create smart alarms and graphical 
user interface for a clinical decision support. Using machine learning, we will 
extract a core dataset, which characterises the signatures of normal 
intraoperative variability, various haemodynamic instability aetiologies and 
variable responses to resuscitation. We will then employ clinician-driven 
iterative design to create a clinical decision support user interface, and 
evaluate its effect in simulated high-risk surgeries.
ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: We will publish the results in a peer-reviewed 
publication and will present this work at professional conferences for the 
anaesthesiology and computer science communities. Patient-level data will be 
made available within 6 months after publication of the primary manuscript. The 
study has been approved by University of California, Los Angeles Institutional 
review board. (IRB #19-0 00 354).

This study explores the association between serum chloride concentrations and 
all-cause mortality among patients in the Surgical Intensive Care Unit (SICU). 
Employing a retrospective cohort design, the study utilized data extracted from 
the Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care IV (MIMIC-IV) database, 
specifically focusing on individuals admitted to the surgical/trauma ICUs. This 
dataset encompassed demographic profiles, laboratory findings, historical 
medical data, vital statistics, and variables pertinent to prognosis. 
Participants were divided into four groups based on their serum chloride 
concentrations. The primary outcomes assessed were mortality rates at 30, 90, 
and 180 days post-admission to the ICU. Analytical methods included Kaplan-Meier 
survival curves, Cox proportional hazards regression models, and Restricted 
Cubic Spline (RCS) analyses to delineate the relationship between serum chloride 
concentrations and patient outcomes. The study cohort comprised 10,996 patients, 
with observed mortality rates of 12.78% at 30 days, 17.14% at 90 days, and 
20.32% at 180 days. Kaplan-Meier analyses revealed significant disparities in 
survival rates across the quartiles of serum chloride during the follow-up 
intervals (p < 0.001). The results from the multivariable Cox regression 
suggested a substantial inverse association between high serum chloride levels 
and decreased mortality at 30 days (hazard ratio [HR]: 0.96; 95%confidence 
interval [CI]: 0.95-0.97; P < 0.001), 90 days (HR: 0.97; 95% CI: 0.96-0.98; 
P < 0.001), and 180 days (HR: 0.97; 95% CI: 0.96-0.98; P < 0.001). Particularly, 
patients in the highest quartile of serum chloride faced significantly lower 
mortality risks compared to those in the lowest quartile (30 days HR = 0.65, 
90 days HR = 0.71, 180 days HR = 0.69, P < 0.001). RCS analysis depicted an 
L-shaped curve demonstrating the dynamics between serum chloride concentrations 
and the risk of all-cause mortality across the 30-day, 90-day, and 180-day 
periods.Starting at a concentration of 104 mmol/L, a decrease in serum chloride 
levels was associated with an increased risk of mortality.These findings 
elucidate a marked nonlinear association between serum chloride levels and 
all-cause mortality in SICU patients, enhancing our comprehension of serum 
chloride's impact on clinical outcomes in this setting.

BACKGROUND: Organ dysfunction (OD) assessment is essential in intensive care 
units (ICUs). However, current OD assessment scores merely describe the number 
and the severity of each OD, without evaluating the duration of organ injury. 
The objective of this study is to develop and validate a machine learning model 
based on the Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (SOFA) score for the prediction 
of mortality in critically ill patients.
MATERIAL AND METHODS: Data from the eICU Collaborative Research Database and 
Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care (MIMIC) -III were mixed for model 
development. The MIMIC-IV and Nanjing Jinling Hospital Surgical ICU database 
were used as external test set A and set B, respectively. The outcome of 
interest was in-ICU mortality. A modified SOFA model incorporating 
time-dimension (T-SOFA) was stepwise developed to predict ICU mortality using 
extreme gradient boosting (XGBoost), support vector machine, random forest and 
logistic regression algorithms. Time-dimensional features were calculated based 
on six consecutive SOFA scores collected every 12 h within the first three days 
of admission. The predictive performance was assessed with the area under the 
receiver operating characteristic curves (AUROC) and calibration plot.
RESULTS: A total of 82,132 patients from the real-world datasets were included 
in this study, and 7,494 patients (9.12%) died during their ICU stay. The T-SOFA 
M3 that incorporated the time-dimension features and age, using the XGBoost 
algorithm, significantly outperformed the original SOFA score in the validation 
set (AUROC 0.800 95% CI [0.787-0.813] vs. 0.693 95% CI [0.678-0.709], p < 0.01). 
Good discrimination and calibration were maintained in the test set A and B, 
with AUROC of 0.803, 95% CI [0.791-0.815] and 0.830, 95% CI [0.789-0.870], 
respectively.
CONCLUSIONS: The time-incorporated T-SOFA model could significantly improve the 
prediction performance of the original SOFA score and is of potential for 
identifying high-risk patients in future clinical application.

BACKGROUND: Acute kidney injury (AKI) is associated with increased mortality in 
critically ill patients. Due to differences in the etiology and 
pathophysiological mechanism, the current AKI criteria put it an embarrassment 
to evaluate clinical therapy and prognosis.
OBJECTIVE: We aimed to identify subphenotypes based on routinely collected 
clinical data to expose the unique pathophysiologic patterns.
METHODS: A retrospective study was conducted based on the Medical Information 
Mart for Intensive Care IV (MIMIC-IV) and the eICU Collaborative Research 
Database (eICU-CRD), and a deep clustering approach was conducted to derive 
subphenotypes. We conducted further analysis to uncover the underlying clinical 
patterns and interpret the subphenotype derivation.
RESULTS: We studied 14,189 and 19,382 patients with AKI within 48 h of ICU 
admission in the two datasets, respectively. Through our approach, we identified 
seven distinct AKI subphenotypes with mortality heterogeneity in each cohort. 
These subphenotypes displayed significant variations in demographics, 
comorbidities, levels of laboratory measurements, and survival patterns. 
Notably, the subphenotypes could not be effectively characterized using the 
Kidney Disease: Improving Global Outcomes (KDIGO) criteria alone. Therefore, we 
uncovered the unique underlying characteristics of each subphenotype through 
model-based interpretation. To assess the usability of the subphenotypes, we 
conducted an evaluation, which yielded a micro-Area Under the Receiver Operating 
Characteristic (AUROC) of 0.81 in the single-center cohort and 0.83 in the 
multi-center cohort within 48-hour of admission.
CONCLUSION: We derived highly characteristic, interpretable, and usable AKI 
subphenotypes that exhibited superior prognostic values.

BACKGROUND: Lactic dehydrogenase (LDH)-to-albumin ratio (LAR) was an independent 
risk factor for mortality in the patients with acute respiratory distress 
syndrome (ARDS) due to coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), while the 
relationship among LAR and short-term, long-term, in-hospital mortalities of 
ARDS remains unclear. The current study aims to investigate the association 
between LAR and significant prognosis in patients with ARDS.
METHODS: We conducted a retrospective cohort study and analyzed patients with 
ARDS on the Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care IV (MIMIC-IV) version 
2.0 database. In the current study, 30-day mortality was defined as the primary 
outcome; 90-day mortality and in-hospital mortality were defined as secondary 
outcomes. Multivariate regression analysis, Kaplan-Meier curve analysis and 
subgroup analysis were performed to research the association between LAR and 
prognosis in patients with ARDS.
RESULTS: A total of 358 critically ill patients with ARDS were enrolled in the 
current study. The mean age of the participants was 62.6±16.0 and the median of 
LAR was 14.3. According to the Kaplan-Meier curve analysis, the higher LAR group 
had a higher 30-day, 90-day and in-hospital mortalities. We also analyzed the 
30-day mortality to receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves by comparing 
the value between LAR and LAR + simplified acute physiology score II (SAPS II). 
The area under the curve (AUC) of the LAR group was 0.694 [95% confidence 
interval (CI): 0.634-0.754, P<0.001], and 0.661 for the LAR + SAPS II (95% CI: 
0.599-0.722, P<0.001). For 30-day mortality, after adjusting for covariates, 
hazard ratios (HRs) (95% CIs) for tertile 2 (LAR 8.7-30.9) and tertile 3 (LAR 
>30.9) were 2.00 (1.37, 2.92) and 2.50 (1.50, 4.15), respectively. Similar 
results were also observed for 90-day mortality and in-hospital mortality.
CONCLUSIONS: Elevated LAR levels are associated with increased 30- and 90-day 
mortalities, as well as in-hospital mortality in patients with ARDS, which means 
LAR levels may predict the mortalities of ARDS patients.

BACKGROUND: Sepsis is a common critical illness in intensive care unit (ICU) and 
seriously threatens the life of patients. Therefore, to identify a simple and 
effective clinical indicator to determine prognosis is essential for the 
management of sepsis patients. This study was mainly based on blood urea 
nitrogen to albumin ratio (B/A), a comprehensive index, to explore its 
correlation with the prognosis of sepsis patients during hospitalization.
METHODS: Totally, adult patients in ICU who were diagnosed with sepsis in 
Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care IV(MIMIC-IV) database from 2008 to 
2019 were involved in this study. The study population were divided into 
survivors group and non-survivors group based on the prognosis during 
hospitalization. Restricted cubic spline (RCS) was utilized to analyze the 
association between B/A level and the risk of ICU all-cause mortality in 
patients with sepsis and determine the optimal cut-off value of B/A. The study 
population was divided into low B/A group and high B/A group based on the 
optimal cut-off value. The survival curve of ICU cumulative survival rate was 
draw through Kaplan-Meier method. The correlation between B/A and the prognosis 
of patients was conducted by multivariate Cox regression analysis. Furthermore, 
we performed sensitivity analyses to assess the robustness of the results.
RESULTS: A total of 10,578 patients with sepsis were enrolled, and the ICU 
all-cause mortality was 15.89%. The patients in the non-survivors group had 
higher B/A values and more comorbidities than those in the survivors group. RCS 
showed that the risk of ICU all-cause mortality increased with the B/A level, 
showing a non-linear trend (χ2 = 66.82, p < 0.001). The mortality rate in the 
high B/A group was significantly higher than that in the low B/A group 
(p < 0.001). Kaplan-Meier curves revealed that compared with the low B/A group, 
the ICU cumulative survival rate of patients with sepsis was significantly lower 
in the high B/A group (log-rank test, χ2 = 148.620, p < 0.001). Further analysis 
of multivariate Cox proportional hazards regression showed that an elevated B/A 
(≥ 7.93) was an independent factor associated with ICU mortality among patients 
with sepsis.
CONCLUSIONS: An elevated B/A might be a useful prognostic indicator in patients 
with sepsis. This study could offer a deeper insight into treating sepsis.

BACKGROUND: Sepsis-associated thrombocytopenia (SAT) is common in critical 
patients and results in the elevation of mortality. Red cell distribution width 
(RDW) can reflect body response to inflammation and oxidative stress. We try to 
investigate the relationship between the RDW and the prognosis of patients with 
SAT through machine learning.
METHODS: 809 patients were retrospectively analyzed from the Medical Information 
Mart for Intensive Care III (MIMIC-III) database. The eXtreme Gradient Boosting 
(XGBoost) and SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) were used to analyze the 
impact of each feature. Logistic regression analysis, propensity score matching 
(PSM), receiver-operating characteristics (ROC) curve analysis, and the 
Kaplan-Meier method were used for data processing.
RESULTS: The patients with thrombocytopenia had higher 28-day mortality (48.2%). 
Machine learning indicated that RDW was the second most important in predicting 
28-day mortality. The RDW was significantly increased in non-survivors by 
logistic regression and PSM. ROC curve shows that RDW has moderate predictive 
power for 28-day mortality. The patients with RDW>16.05 exhibited higher 
mortality through Kaplan-Meier analysis.
CONCLUSIONS: Interpretable machine learning can be applied in clinical research. 
Elevated RDW is not only common in patients with SAT but is also associated with 
a poor prognosis.

Red cell distribution width (RDW) and glycated hemoglobin index (HGI) is 
considered an important tool for assessing the prognosis of sepsis patients, 
closely related to the risk of mortality associated with sepsis. This study 
investigates the association between the HGI combined with RDW and the risk of 
in-hospital mortality in patients with sepsis. We analyzed data from 13,726 
sepsis patients who were admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) for more than 
24 h, sourced from the American Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care 
(MIMIC-IV) database. Kaplan-Meier survival curves and multivariable Cox 
regression analyses were employed to assess the impact of various variables on 
patient outcomes, stratified by quartiles of HGI and RDW. Additionally, 
restricted cubic spline (RCS) analysis was utilized to explore how changes in 
HGI and RDW might influence the studied outcomes. The results indicated that the 
highest quartile (Q4) of the combined metrics significantly increased 
in-hospital mortality compared to the lowest quartile (Q1) (p < 0.0001). 
Multivariable Cox regression analysis revealed that patients in Q4 faced the 
highest risk of in-hospital mortality (hazard ratio: 1.22, 95% confidence 
interval: [1.10-1.36], p < 0.001). RCS analysis demonstrated a nonlinear 
relationship between HGI-RDW and the risk of adverse outcomes. Further analysis 
identified significantly elevated risks in patients over 65 years old, those who 
were widowed, those receiving macrolide antibiotics, and those with congestive 
heart failure or severe liver disease. In conclusion, elevated levels of the 
combined HGI and RDW metrics are independent risk factors for adverse outcomes 
in critically ill patients with sepsis, associated with increased mortality.

Acute myocardial infarction (AMI) in patients with acute kidney injury (AKI) is 
associated with poor long-term outcome. However, the short-term prognosis of AKI 
in patients with ST-elevation AMI (STEMI) needs to be explored further. We 
assessed this relationship between these patients and short-term mortality in 
relation to AKI and chronic kidney disease (CKD). All data were extracted from 
the Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care III database. The primary 
outcome was 28-day mortality. Kaplan-Meier curves, logistic regression models, 
and propensity score matching analysis were used to evaluate the associations 
between AKI in patients with STEMI and outcomes. A total of 1031 patients with 
STEMI met the inclusion criteria. For 28-day mortality, in the multivariable 
logistic regression models, the odds ratio (95% CI) of group 2 (AKI but no CKD) 
and group 3 (AKI in the presence of CKD) were 3.24 (1.46-7.18) and 4.57 
(1.83-11.37), respectively, compared with group 1 (no AKI and no CKD). Comorbid 
AKI increased the risk of short-term mortality among patients with STEMI, 
especially for those with AKI in the presence of CKD.

BACKGROUND: Autoimmune diseases (ADs) may be complicated by sepsis when 
intensive care unit (ICU) admission. But repeated sepsis among AD patients has 
not been studied yet. The aim of this study is to investigate the impact of 
repeated in-ICU sepsis on the 1-year overall-cause mortality, septic shock and 
in-ICU death of AD patients.
METHODS: Data of AD patients with sepsis retrieved from Medical Information Mart 
for Intensive Care IV (MIMIC-IV) database were divided into the single group and 
the repeated group according to the frequency of in-ICU sepsis. Propensity score 
matching was used to balance inter-group bias. Cox proportional hazard 
regression and sensitivity analysis were utilized to assess the variables on 
mortality.
RESULTS: The incidence of repeated in-ICU sepsis in baseline was 19.8%. The 
repeated in-ICU sepsis was a risk factor for 1-year overall-cause mortality 
among AD patients (adjusted hazard ratio [HR] = 1.50, 95% CI: 1.16-1.93, 
P = 0.002), with robust adjusted HRs by the adjustment for confounders in the 
sensitivity analysis (all P < 0.01). Maximum Sequential Organ Failure Assessment 
(Max SOFA), Charlson comorbidity index (CCI) and Simplified Acute Physiology 
Score-II (SAPS-II) were risk factors for 1-year overall-cause mortality among AD 
with repeated sepsis (Max SOFA: HR = 1.09, P = 0.002; CCI: HR = 1.08, P = 0.039; 
SAPS-II: HR = 1.03, P < 0.001).
CONCLUSIONS: Compared to single hit, repeated in-ICU sepsis was independently 
related to a higher risk of 1-year overall-cause mortality among AD patients. 
Assessment tools (Higher SOFA, CCI and SAPS-II scores) were closely linked to 
poor prognosis of AD with repeated sepsis and helped to reflect ill physical 
conditions for the patients.

AIM: The LiFe (liver, injury, failure, evaluation) score, calculated according 
to arterial lactate, total bilirubin, and international normalized ratio (INR), 
is a novel score for risk prediction in intensive care unit (ICU) patients with 
cirrhosis. The present study aimed to externally validate and optimize the LiFe 
score for predicting outcomes in critically ill cirrhosis patients.
METHODS: The study used the single-center database Medical Information Mart for 
Intensive Care-III (MIMIC-III) for analysis. A total of 536 critically ill 
cirrhosis patients from the MIMIC-III database were analyzed. Routine clinical 
and laboratory variables were included to compare survivors with non-survivors. 
The LiFe score was then regraded into three groups to calculate the optimal 
cut-off values.
RESULTS: In-ICU mortality occurred in 169 (31.5%) of the patients. Survivor and 
non-survivor cohorts were similar in age, gender, and etiology of cirrhosis. 
Multivariate analyses of in-ICU mortality identified four independent variables: 
total bilirubin, creatinine, INR, and arterial lactate. An external validation 
of the LiFe score showed good accuracy for predicting in-ICU mortality with an 
area under the receiver operating characteristic curve of 0.708. In addition, a 
significant positive correlation exists between LiFe score and acute-on-chronic 
liver failure grade (r = 0.393, P < 0.001). A log-rank test comparing the strata 
of simplified LiFe scores found that in-ICU mortality rates were 16.8%, 27.7%, 
and 51.7%, respectively, among patients in the three simplified risk categories.
CONCLUSIONS: The LiFe score, based on laboratory tests, can be useful as a 
preliminary and convenient scoring tool in a broad cohort of critically ill 
cirrhosis patients. Simplified risk categories to stratify patients into three 
groups improves its feasibility and generalizability for clinical application.

PURPOSE: To assess the effect of intravenous chloride load on prognosis in 
intensive care unit (ICU) patients with different initial serum chloride levels.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: Participants from the Medical Information Mart for 
Intensive Care IV database were divided into low, normal (>100 and ≤110 mEq/L), 
and high chloride groups according to initial chloride levels. Records of 
intravenous fluids were extracted to calculated the volume adjusted chloride 
load (VACL) and VACL per body weight (VACL-W). The associations of VACL, VACL-W, 
and changes in serum chloride concentration (ΔCl) with mortalities were 
investigated in different initial chloride groups.
RESULTS: Respectively, 4593 (20.9%), 13,364 (60.9%), and 3978 (18.1%) patients 
had a low, normal, and high initial chloride level. Interactions were found 
between initial chloride levels and VACL, VACL-W, and ΔCl on mortality risks. In 
normal and high chloride groups, increased VACL, VACL-W, and ΔCl were associated 
with higher ICU and hospital mortalities. However, in the low chloride group, 
multivariable models found no associations between VACL, VACL-W, or ΔCl with 
mortalities.
CONCLUSIONS: High chloride load and increased serum chloride level were 
associated with poor outcomes in patients with normal or high initial chloride 
levels, but not in those with a low initial chloride level.

BACKGROUND: Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and acute exacerbation 
of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (AECOPD) pose global challenges, with 
oxygen saturation (SpO2) levels crucial in evaluating mortality. This study 
explored the correlation between admission SpO2 levels and all-cause hospital 
mortality in patients with AECOPD, assessing whether SpO2 can serve as an 
independent risk factor for predicting in-hospital mortality in these patients.
METHODS: This study involved 996 AECOPD patients sourced from the Medical 
Information Mart for Intensive Care (MIMIC) III database (version 1.3), with 134 
fatalities. Patients were categorized into a death group (n=134) and a survival 
group (n=862). The average admission SpO2 value was recorded for all 996 AECOPD 
patients. Subsequently, a generalized additive model (GAM) curve was employed to 
examine the association between admission SpO2 levels and all-cause hospital 
mortality. Following this, Cox regression analysis and survival analysis were 
conducted to further investigate the link between admission SpO2 and all-cause 
hospital mortality.
RESULTS: The GAM curve demonstrated a non-linear, U-shaped relationship between 
admission SpO2 and all-cause hospital mortality in AECOPD patients. The nadir of 
all-cause hospital mortality was associated with an SpO2 of 89.5%. Notably, an 
SpO2 of 89.5% served as the optimal cutoff for predicting all-cause hospital 
mortality. Cox regression analysis identified SpO2 as a risk factor for 
all-cause hospital mortality in AECOPD patients. Patients with SpO2 ≥89.5% 
exhibited independently lower death risk compared to those with SpO2 <89.5% 
(hazard ratio: 0.52; 95% confidence interval: 0.37-0.74; P<0.001).
CONCLUSIONS: Admission SpO2 level is an independent risk factor for predicting 
all-cause hospital mortality in AECOPD patients and can serve as a prognostic 
indicator. A U-shaped relationship was observed, with an admission SpO2 level of 
89.5% associated with the lowest mortality, suggesting an optimal range for 
improved prognosis.

BACKGROUND: Coagulopathy is associated with poor prognosis of traumatic brain 
injury (TBI) patients. This study is performed to explore the association 
between serum magnesium level and the risk of coagulopathy in TBI.
METHODS: TBI patients from the Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care-III 
database were included for this study. Logistic regression analysis was 
performed to explore risk factors and develop a predictive model for 
coagulopathy in TBI. The restricted cubic spline (RCS) was utilized to analyze 
the association between serum magnesium level and the development of 
coagulopathy. Receiver operating characteristic curve was drawn to evaluate the 
performance of the predictive model for coagulopathy.
RESULTS: The incidence of coagulopathy in TBI was 32.6%. The RCS indicated the 
association between magnesium and coagulopathy was U-shaped. Multivariate 
logistic regression confirmed age, coronary heart disease, cerebral vascular 
disease, chronic liver disease, GCS, ISS, epidural hematoma, hemoglobin, shock 
index and magnesium level were independently associated with the coagulopathy in 
TBI. Compared with patients of magnesium level between 1.7 and 2.3 mg/dL, those 
with magnesium level below 1.7 mg/dL or above 2.2 mg/dL had a higher risk of 
coagulopathy.
CONCLUSION: Both hypermagnesemia and hypomagnesemia are associated with higher 
risk of coagulopathy in TBI patients. Physicians should pay more attention on 
preventing coagulopathy in TBI patients with hypomagnesemia or hypermagnesemia.

INTRODUCTION: The purpose of the present study was to evaluate the potential 
relationship of lymphocyte-to-monocyte ratio (LMR) with outcomes of septic 
patients at intensive care unit (ICU) admission.
MATERIAL AND METHODS: 3087 septic patients were included in the final cohort by 
using the Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care (MIMIC) database. We 
evaluated the association of different groups of LMRmax with 28-day survival and 
1-year survival via Kaplan-Meier (K-M) analysis and Cox regression analysis. 
Subgroups analysis of LMRmax was performed to further explore the effect of 
LMRmax on survival.
RESULTS: According to the optimal cut-off value, the cohort was divided into 
low-LMRmax and high-LMRmax groups. The 28-day and 1-year survival rates were 
47.9% and 19.9%, respectively, in the low-LMRmax group, and 60.4% and 25.9%, 
respectively, in the high-LMRmax group. Univariate logistic regression and K-M 
analyses revealed that the 28-day and 1-year survival rates of the high-LMRmax 
group were higher than those of the low-LMRmax group (both p < 0.001). A 
subgroup analysis of LMRmax identified a significant stepwise decrease in the 
risk of death at 28 days and 1 year from group 1 to group 4 (LMRmax increased 
gradually) after adjustment for multiple variables.
CONCLUSIONS: We report for the first time that a lower LMRmax value is 
independently predictive of a poor prognosis in septic patients. Therefore, as 
an inexpensive and readily available indicator, LMRmax may facilitate 
stratification of prognosis in septic patients.

OBJECTIVES: We aimed to construct a mortality prediction model using the random 
forest (RF) algorithm for acute kidney injury (AKI) patients in the intensive 
care unit (ICU), and compared its performance with that of two other machine 
learning models and the customized simplified acute physiology score (SAPS) II 
model.
METHODS: We used medical information mart for intensive care (MIMIC) III 
database for model development and performance comparison. The RF model uses the 
same predictor variable set as that of the SAPS II model. We also developed 
three other models and compared the RF model with the other three models in 
prediction performance. Three other models include support vector machine (SVM) 
model, artificial neural network (ANN) model and customized SAPS II model. In 
model comparison, the prediction performance of each model was assessed by the 
Brier score, the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUROC), 
accuracy and F1 score.
RESULTS: The final cohort consisted of 19044 patients with AKI in the ICU. The 
observed in-hospital mortality of AKI patients is 13.6% in the final cohort. The 
results of model performance comparison show that the Brier score of the RF 
model is 0.085 (95%CI: 0.084-0.086) and AUROC of the RF model is 0.866 (95%CI: 
0.862-0.870). The accuracy of the RF model is 0.728 (95%CI: 0.715-0.741). The F1 
score of the RF model is 0.459 (95%CI: 0.449-0.470). The calibration plots show 
that the RF model slightly overestimates mortality in patients with low risk of 
death and underestimates mortality in patients with high risk of death.
CONCLUSION: There is great potential for the RF model in mortality prediction 
for AKI patients in ICU. The RF model may be helpful to aid ICU clinicians to 
make timely clinical intervention decisions for AKI patients, which is critical 
to help reduce the in-hospital mortality of AKI patients. A prospective study is 
necessary to evaluate the clinical utility of the RF model.

Background: The relationship between the partial pressure of oxygen in arterial 
blood (PaO 2 ) and the prognosis of sepsis patients, and its potential variation 
over time, remains unclear. The optimal PaO 2 range for sepsis patients has 
always been a contentious issue, with no consensus. We aimed to explore the 
association between different levels of PaO 2 exposure over time and the 28-day 
mortality of sepsis patients, and to identify the optimal PaO 2 range for sepsis 
patients within a specific time frame. Methods: We retrieved data on adult 
patients diagnosed with sepsis within 24 h before or after intensive care unit 
(ICU) admission from the Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care IV 
(MIMIC-IV, version 2.2) database. We excluded patients who were not admitted to 
the ICU for the first time, those with ICU stay <24 h, and those without PaO 2 
results during their ICU stay. We calculated the time-weighted average (TWA) of 
PaO 2 and used piece-wise exponential additive mixed models (PAMMs) to estimate 
the time-dependent changes in the association between TWA-PaO 2 and patient 
prognosis. Results: A total of 16,880 sepsis patients were included in the MIMIC 
cohort. Results indicated that patients' TWA-PaO 2 correlates with increased 
28-day mortality after ICU admission in sepsis patients, and this association 
was mainly manifested in the early course of the disease. With a time window of 
the first 1-7 days after ICU admission, the optimal TWA-PaO 2 range for sepsis 
patients was ≥130 mmHg and ≤160 mmHg. Increased exposure time, proportion of 
exposure time, and exposure dose of high-risk PaO 2 outside the range were all 
associated with an increased risk of 28-day mortality. Conclusion: PaO 2 in 
sepsis patients should be closely monitored. During the first 1-7 days of ICU 
admission, PaO 2 should be maintained within the range of ≥130 mmHg and ≤160 
mmHg. A dose-dependent relationship exists between high-risk PaO 2 outside the 
range and patient outcome.

BACKGROUND: Carbapenem-resistant microorganism (CRO) transmission in the medical 
setting confers a global threat to public health. However, there is no 
established risk prediction model for infection due to CRO in ICU patients. This 
study aimed to develop a nomogram to predict the risk of acquiring CRO infection 
in patients with the first ICU admission and to determine the length of ICU stay 
(ICU-LOS) and 28-day survival.
METHODS: Patient data were retrieved from the Medical Information Mart for 
Intensive Care (MIMIC-IV) database based on predetermined inclusion and 
exclusion criteria. A CRO was defined as a bacterium isolated from any humoral 
microbial culture that showed insensitivity or resistance to carbapenems. The 
characteristics of CRO and non-CRO patients in the first ICU admission were 
compared. Propensity score matching was applied to balance the differences 
between the CRO and non-CRO cohorts. Kaplan-Meier curves were constructed to 
determine the 28-day survival rate and ICU-LOS. Furthermore, after randomization 
of the CRO cohort into the training and validation sets, a predictive nomogram 
was constructed based on LASSO regression and Logistic regression analysis, and 
its performance was verified by internal validation.
RESULTS: Overall, 4531 patients who had first ICU admission as recorded in 
MIMIC-IV were enrolled, 183 (4.04%) of whom were diagnosed with CRO infection. 
Moreover, CRO infection was independently associated with 28-day survival and 
ICU-LOS in ICU patients. Parameters eligible for inclusion in this nomogram were 
male sex, hemoglobin-min, temperature-max, use of a peripherally inserted 
central catheter line, dialysis treatment, and use of carbapenems. This nomogram 
showed a better performance as indicated by the area under the receiver 
operating characteristic curve values of 0.776 (95% confidence interval [CI] 
0.667-0.750) and 0.723 (95% CI 0.556-0.855) in the training and validation sets, 
respectively, in terms of predicting the risk of acquiring CRO infection.
CONCLUSIONS: CRO infection was independently associated with ICU-LOS and 28-day 
survival in patients with first ICU admission. The nomogram showed the best 
prediction of the risk of acquiring CRO infection in ICU patients. Based on the 
nomogram-based scoring, we can management the risk factors and guide 
individualized prevention and control of CRO.

BACKGROUND: Sepsis continues to carry a high rate of mortality, which makes 
effective and simple evaluation methods for predicting the prognosis of septic 
patients especially important. In this study, we retrospectively analyzed the 
relationships between three scoring systems including Sequential Organ Failure 
Assessment (SOFA) score, Quick SOFA (qSOFA) score, and Logistic Organ 
Dysfunction System (LODS) score and the prognoses of septic patients.
METHODS: The baseline data, SOFA score, qSOFA score, LODS score, 28-day 
prognosis, and 90-day prognosis of patients who met the diagnostic criteria of 
sepsis were retrieved from the Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care III 
(MIMIC-III) database. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves were drawn 
for various indicators, and comparisons were drawn between the areas under the 
ROC curves (AUC) of the different scoring systems.
RESULTS: The 28-day AUC was 0.661 (0.652, 0.670) for SOFA, 0.558 (0.548, 0.568) 
for qSOFA, and 0.668 (0.658, 0.677) for LODS; AUC-qSOFA vs. AUC-LODS was 0.103 
(0.087, 0.120) (P<0.001), and AUC-qSOFA vs. AUC-LODS was 0.110 (0.094, 0.125) 
(P<0.001). The 90-day AUC was 0.630 (0.621, 0.640) for SOFA, 0.551 (0.541, 
0.560) for qSOFA, and 0.644 (0.635, 0.653) for LODS; AUC-SOFA vs. AUC-qSOFA was 
0.079 (0.065, 0.094) (P<0.001), and AUC-qSOFA vs. AUC-LODS was 0.093 (0.079, 
0.107) (P<0.001).
CONCLUSIONS: SOFA score, qSOFA score, and LODS score can all be used to predict 
the prognosis of septic patients. LODS score and SOFA score have higher accuracy 
than qSOFA score; however, qSOFA is simpler to use, making it a more suitable 
tool in an emergency setting.

BACKGROUND: Alactic base excess (ABE) is a novel biomarker to evaluate the renal 
capability of handling acid-base disturbances, which has been found to be 
associated with adverse prognosis of sepsis and shock patients. This study aimed 
to evaluate the association between ABE and the risk of in-hospital mortality in 
patients with acute myocardial infarction (AMI).
METHODS: This retrospective cohort study collected AMI patients' clinical data 
from the Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care (MIMIC)-IV database. The 
outcome was in-hospital mortality after intensive care unit (ICU) admission. 
Univariate and multivariate Cox proportional hazards models were performed to 
assess the association of ABE with in-hospital mortality in AMI patients, with 
hazard ratios (HRs) and 95% confidence intervals (CI). To further explore the 
association, subgroup analyses were performed based on age, AKI, eGFR, sepsis, 
and AMI subtypes.
RESULTS: Of the total 2779 AMI patients, 502 died in hospital. Negative ABE 
(HR = 1.26, 95%CI: 1.02-1.56) (neutral ABE as reference) was associated with a 
higher risk of in-hospital mortality in AMI patients, but not in positive ABE 
(P = 0.378). Subgroup analyses showed that negative ABE was significantly 
associated with a higher risk of in-hospital mortality in AMI patients aged>65 
years (HR = 1.46, 95%CI: 1.13-1.89), with eGFR<60 (HR = 1.35, 95%CI: 1.05-1.74), 
with AKI (HR = 1.32, 95%CI: 1.06-1.64), with ST-segment elevation acute 
myocardial infarction (STEMI) subtype (HR = 1.79, 95%CI: 1.18-2.72), and without 
sepsis (HR = 1.29, 95%CI: 1.01-1.64).
CONCLUSION: Negative ABE was significantly associated with in-hospital mortality 
in patients with AMI.

The red cell distribution width (RDW) has been reported to be positively 
correlated with short-term mortality of pulmonary disease in adults. However, it 
is not clear whether RDW was associated with the long-term prognosis for acute 
respiratory failure (ARF). Thus, an analysis was conducted to evaluate the 
association between RDW and 3-year mortality of patients by the Cox regression 
analysis, generalized additives models, subgroup analysis and Kaplan-Meier 
analysis. A total of 2999 patients who were first admitted to hospital with ARF 
were extracted from the Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care III database 
(MIMIC-III). The Cox regression analysis showed that the high RDW was associated 
with 3-year mortality (HR 1.10, 95% CI 1.07, 1.12, P < 0.0001) after adjusting 
for age, gender, ethnicity and even co-morbid conditions. The ROC curve 
illustrated the AUC of RDW was 0.651 (95% CI 0.631, 0.670) for prediction of 
3-year mortality. Therefore, there is an association between the RDW and 
survival time of 3 years follow-up, particularly a high RDW on admission was 
associated with an increased risk of long-term mortality in patients with ARF. 
RDW may provide an alternative indicator to predict the prognosis and disease 
progression and more it is easy to get.

OBJECTIVE: The relationship between the levels of the first 24-h PaCO2 and the 
prognosis of sepsis-associated encephalopathy (SAE) remains unclear, and the 
first 24-h optimal target for PaCO2 is currently inconclusive. This study was 
performed to investigate the correlation between PaCO2 and all-cause mortality 
for SAE patients, establish a reference range of the initial 24-hour PaCO2 for 
clinicians in critical care, and explain the possible pathophysiological 
mechanisms of abnormal PaCO2 levels as a higher mortality risk factor for SAE.
METHODS: The baseline information and clinical data of patients were extracted 
from the fourth edition Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care database 
(MIMIC-IV 2.0). Multivariate logistic regressions were performed to assess the 
relationship between PaCO2 and all-cause mortality of SAE. Additionally, 
restricted cubic splines, Kaplan-Meier Survival analyses, propensity score 
matching (PSM) analyses, and subgroup analyses were conducted.
RESULTS: A total of 5471 patients were included in our cohort. In the original 
and matched cohort, multivariate logistic regression analysis showed that 
normocapnia and mild hypercapnia may be associated with a more favorable 
prognosis of SAE patients, and survival analysis supported the findings. In 
addition, a U-shaped association emerged when examining the initial 24-hour 
PaCO2 levels in relation to 30-day, 60-day, and 90-day mortality using 
restricted cubic splines, with an average cut-off value of 36.3mmHg (P for 
nonlinearity<0.05). Below the cut-off value, higher PaCO2 was associated with 
lower all-cause mortality, while above the cut-off value, higher PaCO2 was 
associated with higher all-cause mortality. Subsequent subgroup analyses 
revealed similar results for the subcohort of GCS≤8 compared to the original 
cohort. Additionally, when examining the subcohort of GCS>8, a L-shaped 
relationship between PaCO2 and the three clinical endpoints emerged, in contrast 
to the previously observed U-shaped pattern. The findings from the subcohort of 
GCS>8 suggested that patients experiencing hypocapnia had a more unfavorable 
prognosis, which aligns with the results obtained from corresponding 
multivariate logistic regression analyses.
CONCLUSION: The retrospective study revealed the association between the first 
24-h PaCO2 and all-cause mortality risk (30-day, 60-day, and 90-day) for 
patients with SAE in ICU. The range (35mmHg-50mmHg) of PaCO2 may be the optimal 
target for patients with SAE in clinical practice.

BACKGROUND: Sepsis is an important public health issue, and it is urgent to 
develop valuable indicators to predict the prognosis of sepsis. Our study aims 
to assess the predictive value of ICU admission 
(Neutrophil + Monocyte)/lymphocyte ratio (NMLR) on the 30-day mortality of 
sepsis patients.
METHODS: A retrospective analysis was conducted in septic patients, and the data 
were collected from Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care IV (MIMIC-IV). 
Univariate and multivariate Cox regression analyses were conducted to 
investigate the relation between ICU admission NMLR and 30-day mortality. 
Restricted cubic spline (RCS) was performed to determine the optimum cut-off 
value of ICU admission NMLR. Survival outcomes of the two groups with different 
ICU admission NMLR levels were estimated using the Kaplan-Meier method and 
compared by the log-rank test.
RESULTS: Finally, 7292 patients were recruited in the study, of which 1601 died 
within 30 days of discharge. The non-survival group had higher ICU admission 
NMLR values than patients in the survival group (12.24 [6.44-23.67] vs. 8.71 
[4.81-16.26], P < 0.001). Univariate and multivariate Cox regression analysis 
demonstrated that ICU admission NMLR was an independent prognostic predictor on 
30-day mortality (Univariate: P < 0.001; multivariate: P = 0.011). The RCS model 
demonstrated the upturn and non-linear relationship between ICU admission NMLR 
and 30-day mortality (Nonlinearity: P = 0.0124). According to the KM curve 
analysis,30-day survival was worse in the higher ICU admission NMLR group than 
that in the lower ICU admission NMLR group (Log rank test, P < 0.0001).
CONCLUSION: The elevated ICU admission NMLR level is an independent risk factor 
for high 30-day mortality in patients with sepsis.

BACKGROUND: To evaluate the association between blood urea nitrogen (BUN) to 
creatinine (Cr) (BUN/Cr) ratio and the in-hospital mortality of critically ill 
patients with cerebral infarction in intensive care unit (ICU).
METHODS: In this cohort study, the data of 3059 participants with cerebral 
infarction were collected from the Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care 
(MIMIC)-III and the MIMIC-IV database. After propensity score matching (PSM) on 
age and gender, 2085 people were involved in and divided into the alive group (n 
= 1390) and the dead group (n = 695) based on the results of follow-up. 
Multivariate logistic analyses were applied to identify the confounders and the 
association between BUN/Cr and mortality of cerebral infarction.
RESULTS: The median follow-up time was 10.5 days. Among 2778 participants, 695 
were dead at the end of follow-up. Univariate analysis revealed that BUN/Cr 
[risk ratio (RR) = 1.01, 95% confidence interval (CI): 1.01-1.02] might be 
associated with the in-hospital mortality of cerebral infarction patients. After 
adjusting for respiratory failure, malignant cancer, anticoagulation, liver 
disease, white blood cell (WBC), red cell distribution width (RDW), glucose, 
bicarbonate, and temperature, BUN/Cr had week correlation with the increased 
risk of in-hospital mortality of cerebral infarction patients (RR = 1.01, 95% 
CI: 1.01-1.02).
CONCLUSION: This study evaluated the association between BUN/Cr and the 
in-hospital mortality of cerebral infarction patients in ICU and found that 
BUN/Cr had weak correlation with the increased risk of in-hospital mortality of 
patients with cerebral infarction in ICU especially in males and those with 
respiratory failure, malignant cancer, and without liver disease, as well as 
those receiving anticoagulation.

BACKGROUND: Sepsis is a serious disease with high clinical morbidity and 
mortality. Despite the tremendous advances in medicine and nursing, treatment of 
sepsis remains a huge challenge. Our purpose was to explore the effects of shock 
index (SI) trajectory changes on the prognosis of patients within 24 h after the 
diagnosis of sepsis.
METHODS: This study was based on Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care IV 
(MIMIC- IV). The effects of SI on the prognosis of patients with sepsis were 
investigated using C-index and restricted cubic spline (RCS). The trajectory of 
SI in 24 h after sepsis diagnosis was classified by latent growth mixture 
modeling (LGMM). Cox proportional hazard model, double robust analysis, and 
subgroup analysis were conducted to investigate the influence of SI trajectory 
on in-hospital death and secondary outcomes.
RESULTS: A total of 19,869 patients were eventually enrolled in this study. 
C-index showed that SI had a prognostic value independent of Sequential Organ 
Failure Assessment for patients with sepsis. Moreover, the results of RCS showed 
that SI was a prognostic risk factor. LGMM divided SI trajectory into seven 
classes, and patients with sepsis in different classes had notable differences 
in prognosis. Compared with the SI continuously at a low level of 0.6, the SI 
continued to be at a level higher than 1.0, and the patients in the class whose 
initial SI was at a high level of 1.2 and then declined had a worse prognosis. 
Furthermore, the trajectory of SI had a higher prognostic value than the initial 
SI.
CONCLUSION: Both initial SI and trajectory of SI were found to be independent 
factors that affect the prognosis of patients with sepsis. Therefore, in 
clinical treatment, we should closely monitor the basic vital signs of patients 
and arrive at appropriate clinical decisions on basis of their change 
trajectory.

BACKGROUNDS: Although Blood urea nitrogen (BUN) and serum creatinine 
concentration (Cr) has been widely measured in daily clinical practice, 
BUN-to-Cr ratio (BCR) for prognosis among patients admitted with cardiogenic 
shock (CS) remains unknown. The present study was conducted to assess the 
prognostic effectiveness of BCR on CS.
METHODS AND RESULTS: Records of data for patients with CS were extracted from 
public database of the Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care-III 
(MIMIC-III). The primarily endpoint was in-hospital mortality. We incorporated 
multivariate Cox regression model and Kaplan-Meier curve to evaluate the 
relationship between BCR and in-hospital mortality, adjusting for potential 
confounders. Data of 1137 patients with CS were employed for the final cohort, 
with 556 in the low BCR (< 20) and 581 in the high BCR (≥ 20) group. In the 
multivariate Cox model and Kaplan-Meier curve, compared to low BCR, we found 
high BCR was independently associated with significantly improved in-hospital 
survival for CS (HR 0.66, 95% CI 0.51-0.84; P < 0.01). The benefit of high BCR 
on in-hospital survival for CS was remaining among subgroups of acute kidney 
injury (AKI) and non-AKI.
CONCLUSIONS: Our analysis indicated that high BCR, as compared to low BCR, was 
correlated with improved in-hospital survival for participants with CS, with or 
without AKI. The results need to be proved in large prospective studies.

Iron is an essential nutrient for bacterial survival and thus higher iron levels 
may precipitate bacterial infections. We investigated the association between 
the serum iron level and prognosis in patients with sepsis by using the 
single-centre Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care III (MIMIC-III) 
database. Sepsis patients with iron parameters measured on ICU admission were 
included and stratified according to quartiles of serum iron levels. A total of 
1,891 patients diagnosed with sepsis according to the Sepsis-3 criteria were 
included in this study, 324 of whom were septic shock. After adjusting for 
confounding variables, higher iron quartile was associated with an increase in 
90-day mortality in the Cox regression analysis. Moreover, a stepwise increase 
in the risk of 90-day mortality was observed as the quartiles of serum iron 
levels increased in the patients with sepsis. In conclusion, higher serum iron 
levels were independently associated with increased 90-day mortality in this 
large cohort of patients with sepsis.

OBJECTIVE: Quantify tradeoffs in performance, reproducibility, and resource 
demands across several strategies for developing clinically relevant word 
embeddings.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: We trained separate embeddings on all full-text 
manuscripts in the Pubmed Central (PMC) Open Access subset, case reports 
therein, the English Wikipedia corpus, the Medical Information Mart for 
Intensive Care (MIMIC) III dataset, and all notes in the University of 
Pennsylvania Health System (UPHS) electronic health record. We tested embeddings 
in six clinically relevant tasks including mortality prediction and 
de-identification, and assessed performance using the scaled Brier score (SBS) 
and the proportion of notes successfully de-identified, respectively.
RESULTS: Embeddings from UPHS notes best predicted mortality (SBS 0.30, 95% CI 
0.15 to 0.45) while Wikipedia embeddings performed worst (SBS 0.12, 95% CI -0.05 
to 0.28). Wikipedia embeddings most consistently (78% of notes) and the full PMC 
corpus embeddings least consistently (48%) de-identified notes. Across all six 
tasks, the full PMC corpus demonstrated the most consistent performance, and the 
Wikipedia corpus the least. Corpus size ranged from 49 million tokens (PMC case 
reports) to 10 billion (UPHS).
DISCUSSION: Embeddings trained on published case reports performed as least as 
well as embeddings trained on other corpora in most tasks, and clinical corpora 
consistently outperformed non-clinical corpora. No single corpus produced a 
strictly dominant set of embeddings across all tasks and so the optimal training 
corpus depends on intended use.
CONCLUSION: Embeddings trained on published case reports performed comparably on 
most clinical tasks to embeddings trained on larger corpora. Open access corpora 
allow training of clinically relevant, effective, and reproducible embeddings.

BACKGROUND: Red blood cell distribution width (RDW) was a risk factor for poor 
prognosis in acute myocardial infarction (AMI). Recent reports suggested that 
combining RDW with other laboratory metrics could provide a better prediction. 
This retrospective study aimed to investigate whether the RDW-albumin ratio 
(RAR) may be associated with mortality after an AMI.
METHODS: This cohort study was conducted among adults (over 16 years old) with 
AMI in the Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care Database III V1.4 
(MIMIC-III). The primary outcome was 30-day mortality, and the secondary outcome 
was 1-year and 3-year mortality. Cox hazard regression model and Kaplan-Meier 
survival curves were constructed to estimate the effect of biomarkers on 
mortality. We used three models to adjust for potential bias. Receiver operating 
characteristic (ROC) curves and the area under the curve (AUC) were analyzed for 
the excellent performance of RAR on prognosis.
RESULTS: A total of 826 patients were eventually enrolled in our study. In 
multivariate analysis, RAR was found to be associated with 30-day mortality 
(Model 3: HR = 1.23, 95% CI = 1.09-1.39, P < .001). In addition, Subgroup 
analysis showed that the effect of RAR was higher in female patients than in 
male patients (P for interaction = .026). Kaplan-Meier survival curves showed 
that patients in the lower RAR quartile tended to have higher survival rates in 
the short and long term. AMI patients with RAR ≥ 4 had a 122% increase in 3-year 
mortality. Results of ROC and AUC showed that the prognostic performance of RAR 
for mortality was the best (30-day mortality: 0.703; 1-year mortality: 0.729; 
3-year mortality: 0.737).
CONCLUSIONS: RAR is a simple and stable predictor of prognosis in AMI patients. 
Our results support RAR = 4.0 as a criterion for prognostic risk stratification 
of AMI patients.

OBJECTIVE: The prognostic value of the red cell distribution width (RDW) in 
patients with sepsis-induced acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) is still 
elusive. This study is aimed at determining whether RDW is a prognostic 
indicator of sepsis-induced ARDS.
METHODS: This retrospective cohort study included 1161 patients with 
sepsis-induced ARDS. The datasets were acquired from the Medical Information 
Mart for Intensive Care III database. The locally weighted scatter-plot 
smoothing technique, Cox regression, Kaplan-Meier estimator, and subgroup 
analysis were carried out to evaluate the association between RDW and 90-day 
mortality.
RESULTS: The RDW and mortality had a roughly linear increasing relationship. The 
Cox regression model results were as follows: for level 2 (14.5% < RDW < 16.2%), 
hazard ratio (HR) = 1.35, 95% confidence interval (CI) = 1.03-1.77, and for 
level 3 (RDW ≥ 16.2%), HR = 2.07, 95% CI = 1.59-2.69. The following results were 
obtained when RDW was treated as a continuous variable: HR = 1.11, 95%CI = 
1.06-1.15. The P values of the interaction between the RDW and covariates were 
greater than 0.05.
CONCLUSION: RDW is a new independent prognostic marker for patients with 
sepsis-induced ARDS.

OBJECTIVE: To identify factors associated with outcome of septic shock patients 
receiving high dose noradrenaline according to three primary infection sites.
METHODS: This retrospective study was based on data from a publicly available 
ICU database (Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care [MIMIC] III. Septic 
shock patients receiving high dose (≥1 μg/kg per min) noradrenaline and ≥18 
years were identified and their characteristics and outcomes were compared 
according to three primary infection sites (abdominal, respiratory and urinary 
tract).
RESULTS: 154 septic shock patients who received high doses of noradrenaline were 
identified; (89 [58%] had a respiratory infection, 41 [27%] an abdominal 
infection and 24 [16%] a urinary infection). There were no differences among the 
three infection groups in duration/maximum dosage of noradrenaline, length of 
stay in the ICU/hospital, do not resuscitate (DNR) rates, hypertension and 
adequate antimicrobial therapy. Patients with urinary infections had a lower 
risk of death at 28-days compared with those with abdominal or respiratory 
infections.
CONCLUSIONS: The prognosis for septic shock patients receiving high dose 
noradrenaline is poor. Patients with abdominal or respiratory infections are at 
higher risk of death compared with those with urinary infections.

BACKGROUND: Elevated blood urea nitrogen (BUN) and reduced albumin have been 
prominently correlated with unfavorable outcomes in patients with cardiovascular 
diseases. However, whether combination BUN and albumin levels could predict the 
adverse outcomes of cardiac surgery patients remains to be confirmed. Here, we 
investigated the prognostic effect of the preoperative BUN to serum albumin 
ratio (BAR) in cardiac surgery patients.
METHODS: Data were obtained from the Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care 
(MIMIC) III and eICU databases and classified into a training cohort and 
validation cohort. The BAR (mg/g) was calculated by initial BUN (mg/dl)/serum 
albumin (g/dl). The primary outcome was in-hospital mortality. Secondary 
outcomes were 1-year mortality, prolonged length at intensive care unit, and 
duration of hospital stay. The associations of BAR with outcomes were explored 
by multivariate regression analysis and subgroup analyses. Then, C statistics 
were performed to assess the added prognostic impact of BAR beyond a baseline 
risk model.
RESULTS: Patients with in-hospital death had significantly higher levels of BAR. 
Multivariate regression analysis identified BAR, as a categorical or continuous 
variable, as an independent factor for adverse outcomes of cardiac surgery (all 
p < 0.05). Subgroup analyses demonstrated a significant relationship between 
elevated BAR and in-hospital mortality in different subclasses. The addition of 
BAR to a baseline model provided additional prognostic information benefits for 
assessing primary outcome. Results were concordant in the external validation 
cohort.
CONCLUSIONS: Increased preoperative BAR is a potent predictor of unfavorable 
outcomes in patients undergoing cardiac surgery.

BACKGROUND: A backdoor attack controls the output of a machine learning model in 
2 stages. First, the attacker poisons the training data set, introducing a back 
door into the victim's trained model. Second, during test time, the attacker 
adds an imperceptible pattern called a trigger to the input values, which forces 
the victim's model to output the attacker's intended values instead of true 
predictions or decisions. While backdoor attacks pose a serious threat to the 
reliability of machine learning-based medical diagnostics, existing backdoor 
attacks that directly change the input values are detectable relatively easily.
OBJECTIVE: The goal of this study was to propose and study a robust backdoor 
attack on mortality-prediction machine learning models that use electronic 
health records. We showed that our backdoor attack grants attackers full control 
over classification outcomes for safety-critical tasks such as mortality 
prediction, highlighting the importance of undertaking safe artificial 
intelligence research in the medical field.
METHODS: We present a trigger generation method based on missing patterns in 
electronic health record data. Compared to existing approaches, which introduce 
noise into the medical record, the proposed backdoor attack makes it simple to 
construct backdoor triggers without prior knowledge. To effectively avoid 
detection by manual inspectors, we employ variational autoencoders to learn the 
missing patterns in normal electronic health record data and produce trigger 
data that appears similar to this data.
RESULTS: We experimented with the proposed backdoor attack on 4 machine learning 
models (linear regression, multilayer perceptron, long short-term memory, and 
gated recurrent units) that predict in-hospital mortality using a public 
electronic health record data set. The results showed that the proposed 
technique achieved a significant drop in the victim's discrimination performance 
(reducing the area under the precision-recall curve by at most 0.45), with a low 
poisoning rate (2%) in the training data set. In addition, the impact of the 
attack on general classification performance was negligible (it reduced the area 
under the precision-recall curve by an average of 0.01025), which makes it 
difficult to detect the presence of poison.
CONCLUSIONS: To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study to propose a 
backdoor attack that uses missing information from tabular data as a trigger. 
Through extensive experiments, we demonstrated that our backdoor attack can 
inflict severe damage on medical machine learning classifiers in practice.

We developed an intuitive and user-friendly nomogram based on clinical 
laboratory data for early outcome predictions for patients with traumatic brain 
injury requiring mechanical ventilation who were admitted to the intensive care 
unit for the first time. We included 625 patients from the Medical Information 
Mart for Intensive Care IV 2.2 database as the training cohort and 107 patients 
from the Affiliated Dongyang Hospital of Wenzhou Medical University as the 
external validation cohort. The least absolute shrinkage and selection operator 
regression analysis, combined with univariate and multivariate Cox regression 
analyses, was used to identify independent risk factors. Age, sex, partial 
pressure of carbon dioxide, white blood cell count, creatinine levels, 
prothrombin time, and partial thromboplastin time were included in the nomogram. 
The area under the receiver operating characteristic curve was 0.811 for the 
training cohort and 0.770 for the external validation cohort. The calibration 
curves, clinical decision curve analysis, and clinical impact curve demonstrated 
that the nomogram had a good goodness-of-fit and clinical utility. We developed 
a nomogram based on clinical laboratory data for predicting the early (14-day) 
mortality rate of patients with traumatic brain injury requiring mechanical 
ventilation, which may help assess patient risk and decision-making.

OBJECTIVES: This study investigates serum markers for short-term prognosis in 
hepatic encephalopathy patients.
BACKGROUND: Patients with hepatic encephalopathy face elevated mortality rates 
and bleak prognoses. However, effective prognostic models or indicators are 
lacking. This study aims to explore serum markers for predicting short-term 
prognosis in these patients.
METHODS: We conducted a retrospective analysis of 552 patients with hepatic 
encephalopathy, categorizing 429 individuals meeting exclusion criteria into 
normal and high activated partial thromboplastin time (APTT) groups. We assessed 
12-day and 25-day survival rates using Kaplan-Meier analysis and Cox regression 
models to examine associations between groups and outcomes.
RESULTS: Upon comparing baseline characteristics, the high APTT group exhibited 
significant disparities in acute kidney injury, sepsis, coagulation disorders, 
and ascites (p < 0.05). In the multivariate COX regression model, the hazard 
ratios [HRs; 95% confidence interval (CI)] of 12- and 25-day mortality were 
1.012 (1.001, 1.022, p = 0.033) and 1.010 (1.002, 1.018, p = 0.013), 
respectively. We discovered that APTT demonstrated an independent association 
with prognosis. Our findings revealed that the ability of APTT to predict 
short-term prognosis surpasses that of the traditional MELD model. Regarding 12- 
and 25-day survival, Kaplan-Meier survival curves from these groups demonstrated 
a lower survival probability for patients in the high APTT group than the normal 
group (log-rank p < 0.05). The results of subgroup analysis and interaction 
analysis indicate that APTT is not influenced by other confounding factors.
CONCLUSION: A prolonged APTT suggests a poorer short-term prognosis in patients 
with hepatic encephalopathy.

BACKGROUND: To develop an inflammatory biomarker-based, simple-to-use nomogram 
for the early identification of septic patients at high risk of mortality in the 
emergency department (ED).
METHODS: All patients diagnosed with sepsis admitted to the intensive care unit 
(ICU) from the ED were screened from the Medical Information Mart for Intensive 
Care III database and divided into two cohorts: the primary cohort and the 
validation cohort. We used bivariate logistic regression analysis to determine 
independent risk factors and to construct a predictive nomogram and subsequently 
evaluated the calibration, discrimination and clinical usefulness of the 
nomogram. The gradient boosting machine (GBM) model was used to more accurately 
evaluate these variables.
RESULTS: A total of 5663 admissions were enrolled, of which 3964 comprised the 
primary cohort and 1699 comprised the validation group, with 28-day mortality 
rates of 21.2% and 20.4%, respectively. Age > 69, neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio 
(NLR) > 9.8, platelet-to-lymphocyte ratio (PLR) > 249.89, lymphocyte-to-monocyte 
ratio (LMR) ≤ 2.18, and red cell distribution width (RDW) were detected as 
important determinants of 28-day mortality and included in the nomogram. The 
calibration plot revealed an adequate fit of the nomogram for predicting the 
risk of 28-day mortality. Regarding discriminative ability, receiver operating 
characteristic curve analysis showed that the nomogram had an area under the 
curve (AUC) of 0.826 (95% CI: 0.811-0.841, P < 0.001) in the primary cohort, 
which was greater than that of all individual parameters and other scores. 
Decision curve analysis also indicated that our nomogram was feasible in 
clinical practice, as the threshold probabilities were 0-0.62 for the primary 
cohort. The GBM model yielded a significantly greater AUC of up to 0.867.
CONCLUSIONS: This proposed simple-to-use nomogram based on age, NLR, PLR, LMR 
and RDW provides a relatively accurate mortality prediction for septic patients 
in the ED.

Background: Diabetes mellitus (DM) has a high morbidity and mortality worldwide, 
and it is a risk factor for cardiovascular diseases. Non-diabetic stress 
hyperglycemia is common in severely ill patients, and it could affect prognosis. 
This study aimed to analyze the influence of different blood glucose levels on 
prognosis from the perspective of stress hyperglycemia by comparing them with 
normal blood glucose levels and those of patients with DM. Methods: A 
retrospective study of 1,401 patients in coronary care unit (CCU) from the 
critical care database called Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care IV was 
performed. Patients were assigned to the following groups 1-4 based on their 
history of DM, random blood glucose, and HbA1c levels: normal blood glucose 
group, moderate stress hyperglycemia group, severe stress hyperglycemia group 
and DM group. The main outcome of this study was 30- and 90-day mortality rates. 
The associations between groups and outcomes were analyzed using Kaplan-Meier 
survival analysis, Cox proportional hazard regression model and competing risk 
regression model. Results: A total of 1,401 patients in CCU were enrolled in 
this study. The Kaplan-Meier survival curve showed that group 1 had a higher 
survival probability than groups 3 and 4 in terms of 30- and 90-day mortalities. 
After controlling the potential confounders in Cox regression, groups 3 and 4 
had a statistically significant higher risk of both mortalities than group 1, 
while no difference in mortality risk was found between groups 2 and 1. The 
hazard ratios [95% confidence interval (CI)] of 30- and 90-day mortality rates 
for group 3 were 2.77(1.39,5.54) and 2.59(1.31,5.12), respectively, while those 
for group 4 were 1.92(1.08,3.40) and 1.94(1.11,3.37), respectively. Conclusions: 
Severe stress hyperglycemia (≥200 mg/dL) in patients without DM in CCU may 
increase the risk of short-term death, which is greater than the prognostic 
effect in patients with diabetes. Patients with normal blood glucose levels and 
moderate stress hyperglycemia (140 mg/dL ≤ RBG <200 mg/dL) had no effect on 
short-term outcomes in patients with CCU.

BACKGROUND: We aimed to evaluate the predictive power of systemic inflammation 
response index (SIRI), a novel biomarker, to predict all-cause mortality in 
patients with traumatic brain injury (TBI) in the intensive care unit (ICU).
METHODS: Clinical data were retrieved from the Medical Information Mart for 
Intensive Care-IV (MIMIC-IV) database. Kaplan-Meier (KM) methods and cox 
proportional hazard models were performed to examine the association between 
SIRI and all-cause mortality. The predictive power of SIRI was evaluated 
compared to other leukocyte-related indexes including neutrophils, lymphocytes, 
monocytes and white blood cells (WBC) by the Receiver Operating Characteristic 
(ROC)curve for 30-day mortality. In addition, propensity score matching (PSM) 
was conducted to reduce confounding.
RESULTS: A total of 350 TBI patients were enrolled overall in our study. The 
optimal cutoff point of SIRI was determined at 11.24 × 109/L. After 1:1 PSM, 66 
matched pairs (132 patients) were generated. During the 30-day, in-hospital and 
365-day follow-up periods, patients with low SIRI level were associated with 
improved survival (p < 0.05) compared with patients with high SIRI level. Cox 
regression analysis identified that higher SIRI values was an independent risk 
factor for all-cause mortality and results were stable on multiple subgroup 
analyses. Furthermore, ROC analysis indicated that the area under the curve of 
SIRI [0.6658 (95% Confidence Interval, 0.5630-0.7687)] was greater than that of 
neutrophils, monocytes, lymphocytes and WBC. The above results were also 
observed in the matched cohort.
CONCLUSION: It was suggested that TBI patients with high SIRI level would suffer 
from a high risk of 30-day, in-hospital and 365-day mortality. SIRI is a 
promising inflammatory biomarker for predicting TBI patients' prognosis with

BACKGROUND: Inflammation plays a key role in the pathophysiology and progression 
of acute kidney injury (AKI). Red cell distribution width (RDW) to platelet 
ratio (RPR) is a novel inflammatory index, and its prognostic effect on 
critically ill patients with AKI is rarely investigated. This work is aimed at 
investigating the association between RPR and in-hospital mortality in these 
patients.
METHODS: Data were extracted from the Medical Information Mart for Intensive 
Care III database. All-cause death during hospitalization was selected as the 
primary outcome. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve was used to 
determine the optimal cut-off value, and the area under the curve (AUC) was 
applied to compare predictive ability among different indices. Cox proportional 
hazard models were utilized to assess the association between RPR and 
in-hospital mortality. Restricted cubic spline analysis for multivariate Cox 
model was performed to explore the shape of the relationship between RPR and 
mortality.
RESULTS: A total of 24,166 critically ill patients with AKI were included. The 
relationship of RPR and in-hospital mortality was nonlinear with a trend to rise 
rapidly and then gradually. For mortality prediction, RPR had the optimal 
cut-off value of 0.093, of which the AUC was 0.791 (95% confidence interval 
(CI): 0.773-0.810), which was higher than those of RDW, platelet, sequential 
organ failure assessment score, simplified acute physiology score II, neutrophil 
to lymphocyte ratio, and platelet to lymphocytes ratio. After adjustments for 
various confounders, high RPR showed a significant association with increased 
mortality with hazard ratios of 1.46 (95% CI: 1.40-1.55) for categorical 
variable and 1.88 (95% CI: 1.80-1.97) for continuous variables in the fully 
adjusted model.
CONCLUSIONS: Elevated RPR on admission is substantially associated with high 
risk of in-hospital mortality in critically ill patients with AKI and thus may 
serve as a novel predictor of prognosis for these patients.

OBJECTIVE: Abnormalities of liver-related indices are common in ICU patients, 
but the effects of cholestasis and hypoxic hepatitis in critically ill patients 
remains unclarified. The purpose of this study was to investigate the effects of 
cholestasis and hypoxic liver dysfunction on the prognosis of ICU patients.
METHODS: A retrospective study was conducted based on the data of patients 
admitted to the ICU for the first time between 2001 and 2011 archived in the 
MIMIC-Ⅲ database. The patients were divided into cholestasis, hypoxic hepatitis 
and control groups, and their 28-day case fatality rate as the primary outcome 
was compared among the groups.
RESULTS: A total of 5852 ICU patients were included in the analysis. The 
incidence of cholestasis and hypoxic liver dysfunction was 31.9% (1869/5852) and 
17.9% (1046/5852), respectively. There was no significant difference in 28-day 
case fatality rate between cholestasis group and the control group. Compared 
with the control group, the patients with hypoxic hepatitis had a significantly 
higher 28-day case fatality rate (46% vs 35%, P < 0.01), a higher hospital case 
fatality rate (40% vs 31%, P < 0.01), and a higher ICU case fatality rate (35.7% 
vs 22.2%, P < 0.01). Logistic regression analysis showed that lactic acid (LAC), 
aspartate transaminase (AST), and international standard ratio (INR) were 
independent risk factors for 28-day case fatality rate.
CONCLUSION: The incidence of cholestatic liver dysfunction is higher than that 
of hypoxic hepatitis, but it does not increase the 28-day case fatality rate of 
the ICU patients, suggesting that cholestatic liver dysfunction may be the early 
adaptation of the liver to critical diseases.

Sepsis, a syndrome with disturbed host response to severe infection, is a 
critical health problem worldwide. It is urged to develop and update novel 
therapeutic strategies for improving the outcome of sepsis. In this study, we 
demonstrated that different bacteria clustering in sepsis patients may generate 
differences of prognosis results. We extracted all the sepsis patients from 
Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care IV 2.0 (MIMIC-IV 2.0) critical care 
data set according to certain standards and clinical score, a total of 2,339 
patients were included in our study. Then we used multiple data analytics and 
machine learning methods to make all data deeply analyzed and elucidated. The 
results showed that the types of bacteria infected by patients with different 
ages, sex and race are different, the types of bacteria infected by patients 
with different SIRS values and GCS scores of the first day are different, and 
the severity of patients with different clusters is different, and most 
importantly, the survival rate of patients with different clusters also has this 
significant difference. We concluded prognostic assessment predicated by 
bacteria clustering might be a relatively potentially novel strategies and 
perspectives on prevention and management for sepsis in the future.

OBJECTIVES: This study aimed to evaluate the association between the red blood 
cell distribution width (RDW) and mortality in patients with stroke.
METHODS: We conducted a retrospective cohort study on patients with stroke in 
the Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care Database III. Cox proportional 
hazards regression models were used to estimate hazard ratios of 30-day, 90-day, 
and 1-year mortality in relation to the RDW level.
RESULTS: A total of 4134 patients were enrolled, including 2646 patients with 
ischemic stroke and 1668 with hemorrhagic stroke. After adjustment for potential 
confounders, the hazard ratio (95% confidence interval) of 30-day mortality for 
the second (RDW: 13.4%-14.3%) and third (>14.3%) tertiles was 1.15 (0.96, 1.37) 
and 1.40 (1.17, 1.68), respectively, compared with the reference group (<13.4%). 
A two-piecewise linear regression model was established and the inflection point 
of RDW was 16.7%. When RDW was >16.7%, an increase in RDW did not increase 
stroke mortality.
CONCLUSIONS: The RDW is a prognostic factor of patients with stroke. This 
finding needs to be confirmed in future prospective studies.

BACKGROUND: This study aimed to assess the prognostic significance of serum 
ferritin levels in sepsis-associated acute kidney injury (SA-AKI) and their 
correlation with short-term mortality. Despite the established predictive value 
of serum ferritin in various serious diseases, its specific prognostic relevance 
in SA-AKI remains unexplored. Therefore, this study seeks to fill this research 
gap by investigating the association between serum ferritin levels and 
short-term mortality in patients with SA-AKI.
METHODS: This retrospective cohort study utilized clinical data from the Medical 
Information Mart for Intensive Care-IV (MIMIC-IV) database, including all 
patients with SA-AKI admitted to the intensive care unit for the first time. The 
relationship between serum ferritin levels and 28-day mortality was explored 
using restricted cubic splines. Kaplan-Meier curves and Cox regression models 
were employed to evaluate the association between serum ferritin levels and 
mortality. Subgroup and sensitivity analyses were performed to verify the 
robustness of the results.
RESULTS: In this study, a total of 878 patients (486 males and 392 females) with 
a median age of 63.7 years were enrolled. The results indicated that increasing 
serum ferritin levels were linearly associated with a gradual increase in 28-day 
mortality rates. Specifically, patients in the highest quartile of serum 
ferritin had significantly higher 28-day mortality compared to those in the 
reference group (the first quartile of ferritin levels). After adjusting for 
various factors, the fully adjusted hazard ratio was 1.92 (95% CI: 1.24-2.96, p 
= 0.003).
CONCLUSION: In patients with SA-AKI, higher serum ferritin levels are associated 
with an increased 28-day mortality rate.

BACKGROUND: The data missing from patient profiles in intensive care units 
(ICUs) are substantial and unavoidable. However, this incompleteness is not 
always random or because of imperfections in the data collection process.
OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to investigate the potential hidden information in 
data missing from electronic health records (EHRs) in an ICU and examine whether 
the presence or missingness of a variable itself can convey information about 
the patient health status.
METHODS: Daily retrieval of laboratory test (LT) measurements from the Medical 
Information Mart for Intensive Care III database was set as our reference for 
defining complete patient profiles. Missingness indicators were introduced as a 
way of representing presence or absence of the LTs in a patient profile. 
Thereafter, various feature selection methods (filter and embedded feature 
selection methods) were used to examine the predictive power of missingness 
indicators. Finally, a set of well-known prediction models (logistic regression 
[LR], decision tree, and random forest) were used to evaluate whether the 
absence status itself of a variable recording can provide predictive power. We 
also examined the utility of missingness indicators in improving predictive 
performance when used with observed laboratory measurements as model input. The 
outcome of interest was in-hospital mortality and mortality at 30 days after ICU 
discharge.
RESULTS: Regardless of mortality type or ICU day, more than 40% of the 
predictors selected by feature selection methods were missingness indicators. 
Notably, employing missingness indicators as the only predictors achieved 
reasonable mortality prediction on all days and for all mortality types (for 
instance, in 30-day mortality prediction with LR, we achieved area under the 
curve of the receiver operating characteristic [AUROC] of 0.6836±0.012). 
Including indicators with observed measurements in the prediction models also 
improved the AUROC; the maximum improvement was 0.0426. Indicators also improved 
the AUROC for Simplified Acute Physiology Score II model-a well-known ICU 
severity of illness score-confirming the additive information of the indicators 
(AUROC of 0.8045±0.0109 for 30-day mortality prediction for LR).
CONCLUSIONS: Our study demonstrated that the presence or absence of LT 
measurements is informative and can be considered a potential predictor of 
in-hospital and 30-day mortality. The comparative analysis of prediction models 
also showed statistically significant prediction improvement when indicators 
were included. Moreover, missing data might reflect the opinions of examining 
clinicians. Therefore, the absence of measurements can be informative in ICUs 
and has predictive power beyond the measured data themselves. This initial case 
study shows promise for more in-depth analysis of missing data and its 
informativeness in ICUs. Future studies are needed to generalize these results.

PROBLEM: Premature rupture of membranes (PROM) can lead to adverse maternal and 
neonatal outcomes. Identifying predictors of length of hospital stay (LOS) in 
PROM patients can aid in improving management and prognosis.
METHOD OF STUDY: The Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care IV database was 
searched to acquire data on PROM individuals. A univariable analysis, LASSO 
regression, and multivariable generalized linear model (GLM) were adopted to 
identify factors closely related to LOS. Next, the change trends in the key 
variable over multiple time points were determined using a latent class 
trajectory model (LCTM). The association of these trajectories with LOS was 
analyzed using GLMs.
RESULTS: The retrospective study finally enrolled 868 samples. The significant 
factors included initial hemoglobin, chorioamnionitis, premature birth, and 
rupture to delivery interval <24 h. Notably, higher initial hemoglobin level was 
independently associated with shorter LOS (β = -0.599; 95% CI = [-0.846, 
-0.352]; p < 0.05). The stratified analysis confirmed this association in all 
subgroups except those with chorioamnionitis. The LCTM identified three 
hemoglobin trajectories. Compared to other trajectory groups, the "lowest, 
declining" group had longer LOS (p < 0.05).
CONCLUSIONS: PROM patients with lower initial hemoglobin levels and the "lowest, 
declining" trajectory group were linked to longer LOS. Monitoring and managing 
hemoglobin levels is important in improving patient outcomes.

BACKGROUND: We aimed to investigate the association between usage of 
transthoracic echocardiography (TTE) within 24 hours after acute kidney injury 
(AKI) and the prognosis of patients in intensive care unit (ICU).
METHODS: The Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care III (MIMIC-III) 
database was used to identify AKI patients with and without TTE administration. 
The primary outcome was 28-day mortality. Multivariable regression was used to 
clarify the association between TTE and clinical outcomes and propensity score 
matching (PSM) and inverse probability of treatment weighting (IPTW) were 
utilized to validate our findings.
RESULTS: Among 23,945 eligible AKI patients, 3361 patients who received TTE and 
3361 who did not conduct TTE had similar propensity scores which were included 
in this study. After matching, the TTE group had a significantly lower 28-day 
mortality (OR 0.80, 95% CI 0.72-0.88, P<0.001). Patients in the TTE group 
received more fluid on day 1 and day 2 and had a more urine volume on day 1 and 
day 3, and the reduction in serum creatinine was greater than that in the no TTE 
group. The mediating effect of creatinine reduction was remarkable for the whole 
cohort (P=0.02 for the average causal mediation effect).
CONCLUSION: TTE utilization was associated with decreased risk-adjusted 28-day 
mortality for AKI patients in ICU and was proportionally mediated through 
creatinine reduction.

INTRODUCTION: Numerous diseases have been found to be associated with the 
lactate-to-albumin ratio (LAR), as confirmed by existing research. This study 
aims to investigate the relationship between LAR within 24 hours of admission 
and a 28-day mortality rate in patients manifesting ischemic stroke.
METHODS: This retrospective cohort study utilized data from the Medical 
Information Mart for Intensive Care IV (MIMIC-IV, version 2.1) database. We 
included adult patients with acute ischemic stroke (AIS) who were admitted to 
the intensive care unit. The primary outcome entailed evaluating the ability of 
LAR to predict death at 28-day of hospital admission in patients with AIS.
RESULTS: A total of 502 patients with ischemic stroke were enrolled in the 
study, of which 185 (36.9 %) died within 28 days after hospital admission. We 
identified a linear association between LAR and mortality risk. Compared with 
the reference group (first LAR tertile), the 28-day mortality was increased in 
the highest tertile; the fully adjusted HR value was 1.21 (1.08 to 1.40). the 
Area Under the Curve (AUC) value for LAR was 58.26 % (95 % CI: 53.05 % - 63.46 
%), which was higher than that for arterial blood lactate (AUC = 56.88 %) and 
serum albumin (AUC = 55.29 %) alone. It was not inferior even when compared to 
SOFA (AUC = 56.28 %). The final subgroup analysis exhibited no significant 
interaction of LAR with each subgroup (P for interaction: 0.079 - 0.848).
CONCLUSION: In our study, LAR emerged as a promising predictor of all-cause 
mortality in acute ischemic stroke patients within 28 days of admission.

OBJECTIVE: This study aims to develop a nomogram model incorporating 
lactate-to-albumin ratio (LAR) to predict the prognosis of hospitalized patients 
with intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH) and demonstrate its excellent predictive 
performance.
METHODS: A total of 226 patients with ICH from the Medical information mart for 
intensive care III (MIMIC Ⅲ) database were randomly split into 8:2 ratio 
training and experimental groups, and 38 patients from the eICU-CRD for external 
validation. Univariate and multivariate Cox proportional hazards regression 
analysis was performed to identify independent factors associated with ICH, and 
multivariate Cox regression was used to construct nomograms for 7-day and 14-day 
overall survival (OS). The performance of nomogram was verified by the 
calibration curves, decision curves, and receiver operating characteristic (ROC) 
curves.
RESULTS: Our study identified LAR, glucose, mean blood pressure, sodium, and 
ethnicity as independent factors influencing in-hospital prognosis. The 
predictive performance of our nomogram model for predicting 7-day and 14 -day OS 
(AUCs: 0.845 and 0.830 respectively) are both superior to Oxford Acute Severity 
of Illness Score, Simplified acute physiology score II, and SIRS (AUCs: 0.617, 
0.620 and 0.591 and AUCs: 0.709, 0.715 and 0.640, respectively) in internal 
validation, and also demonstrate favorable predictive performance in external 
validation (AUCs: 0.778 and 0.778 respectively).
CONCLUSIONS: LAR as a novel biomarker is closely associated with an increased 
risk of in-hospital mortality of patients with ICH. The nomogram model 
incorporating LAR along with glucose, mean blood pressure, sodium, and ethnicity 
demonstrate excellent predictive performance for predicting the prognosis of 7- 
and 14-day OS of hospitalized patients with ICH.

OBJECTIVE: The predictive value of red blood cell distribution width (RDW) in 
patients in the coronary care unit (CCU) remains unknown. This study aimed to 
examine the prognostic value of RDW in these patients.
METHODS: Clinical data were extracted from the Medical Information Mart for 
Intensive Care-III database. Baseline data were collected within 24 hours after 
patients' first admission to the CCU. The outcomes of our study were 30-day and 
90-day mortality.
RESULTS: A total of 8254 patients were included and their mean age was 
66.9 ± 15.8 years (56% were men). For 30-day all-cause mortality, the hazard 
ratios (95% confidence interval) of the medium RDW (13.7-15.3) and high-RDW 
groups > 15.3) were 1.72 (1.55, 1.91) and 2.57 (2.33, 2.85), respectively, 
compared with the reference group in an unadjusted model. This association 
remained similar in multivariate models. Similar correlations were observed for 
90-day all-cause mortality. The areas under the curve of RDW and the Sequential 
Organ Failure Assessment (SOFA) score were 0.625 and 0.692, respectively.
CONCLUSIONS: RDW is correlated with an increased risk of 30-day and 90-day 
mortality of patients in the CCU. The predictive value of RDW is not as good as 
that of the SOFA score.

BACKGROUND: We aimed to evaluate the prognostic ability of blood urea nitrogen 
(BUN) to serum albumin ratio (BAR) to predict in-hospital mortality in patients 
with lung cancer in the intensive care unit (ICU).
METHODS: Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care IV (MIMIC-IV v1.0) database 
was used to identify patients who were diagnosed with lung cancer. The primary 
outcome was in-hospital mortality. Multivariate COX regression was used to 
investigate the association between BAR and in-hospital mortality and propensity 
score matching (PSM) and inverse probability of treatment weighting (IPTW) were 
also used to ensure the robustness of our findings. eICU-CRD database 
(validation cohort) was also applied to validate our findings.
RESULTS: The optimal cut-off value for BAR was 6.8mg/g. Among 1202 patients who 
were diagnosed with lung cancer, 287 high-BAR group (≥6.8mg/g) patients and 287 
low-BAR group (<6.8mg/g) patients, who had similar propensity scores were 
included in this study. After matching, the high-BAR group had significantly 
higher in-hospital mortality (hazard ratio, HR, 2.24, 95% confidence index, 95% 
CI, 1.57-3.19, P<0.001) even after adjustment for confounding factors. Moreover, 
the performance of BAR was superior to that of BUN and serum albumin alone and 
could add net benefit in predicting in-hospital mortality. Those results were 
further confirmed in the validation cohort.
CONCLUSION: As an easily accessible and cost-effective parameter, BAR could 
serve as a good prognostic predictor for lung cancer patients in ICU.

OBJECTIVES: Prolonged admissions to an ICU are associated with high resource 
utilization and personal cost to the patient. Previous reports suggest 
increasing length of stay may be associated with poor outcomes. Conditional 
survival represents the probability of future survival after a defined period of 
treatment on an ICU providing a description of how prognosis evolves over time. 
Our objective was to describe conditional survival as length of ICU stay 
increased.
DESIGN: Retrospective observational cohort study of three large intensive care 
databases.
SETTING: Three intensive care databases, two in the United States (Medical 
Information Mart for Intensive Care III and electronic ICU) and one in United 
Kingdom (Post Intensive Care Risk-Adjusted Alerting and Monitoring).
PATIENTS: Index admissions to intensive care for patients 18 years or older.
INTERVENTIONS: None.
MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: A total of 11,648, 38,532, and 165,125 index 
admissions were analyzed from Post Intensive Care Risk-Adjusted Alerting and 
Monitoring, Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care III and electronic ICU 
databases respectively. In all three cohorts, conditional survival declined over 
the first 5-10 days after ICU admission and changed little thereafter. In 
patients greater than or equal to 75 years old conditional survival continued to 
decline with increasing length of stay.
CONCLUSIONS: After an initial period of 5-10 days, probability of future 
survival does not appear to decrease with increasing length of stay in 
unselected patients admitted to ICUs in United Kingdom and United States 
[corrected]. These findings were consistent between the three populations and 
suggest that a prolonged admission to an ICU is not a reason for a pessimism in 
younger patients but may indicate a poor prognosis in the older population.

Red blood cell distribution width (RDW) is considered to be associated with the 
prognosis of patients with severe infections. This study aims to investigate the 
relationship between RDW and prognosis in osteomyelitis patients admitted to the 
ICU. Through a retrospective cohort study, relevant records of severe 
osteomyelitis patients were collected from the Medical Information Mart for 
Intensive Care (MIMIC-IV) database. Patients were divided into low-level and 
high-level groups based on the median RDW. The primary outcome was the one-year 
mortality rate of ICU patients. Univariate and multivariate Cox models were used 
to determine the relationship between RDW and mortality rate in osteomyelitis 
patients, with hazard ratios (HRs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) 
calculated. Kaplan-Meier survival curves were used to analyze patient survival 
status. Restricted Cubic Spline (RCS) was used to detect the nonlinear 
relationship between RDW and mortality rate. Stratified analysis was performed 
to explore the interaction between different subgroups. The study included a 
total of 1109 patients, among which 134 (12.08%) died within one year. Results 
from both univariate and multivariate Cox regression analyses indicated a 
significant association between elevated RDW levels (HR = 2.128, 95% CI 
1.324-3.420) and an increased risk of mortality in patients with osteomyelitis. 
Kaplan-Meier survival curves demonstrated that the survival time of patients in 
the low RDW group was greater than that of those in the high RDW group 
(p < 0.0001). RCS analysis revealed a non-linear increase in the strength of the 
correlation between patient mortality rate and continuous changes in RDW. 
Subgroup analysis also observed a relationship between RDW levels and mortality 
rates in patients with osteomyelitis. Elevated RDW levels are correlated with an 
increased risk of mortality in osteomyelitis patients admitted to the ICU.

Objective: To examine the clinical significance of the blood lactate (Lac)/serum 
albumin (Alb) ratio and the Lac/Alb × age score for assessing the severity and 
prognosis of patients with sepsis. Methods: A total of 8,029 patients with 
sepsis, aged >18 years were enrolled between June 2001 to October 2012 from the 
latest version of the Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care III (MIMIC-III 
v.1.4). The general data of the patients were obtained from hospital records and 
included gender, age, body mass index (BMI), laboratory indices, the sequential 
organ failure assessment (SOFA) score, and simplified acute physiology score II 
(SAPS II). The patients were graded and scored according to their age and then 
divided into a survival or death group based on their prognosis. The Lac/Alb 
ratio after ICU admission was calculated and compared between the two groups. 
The risk factors for death in patients with sepsis were determined using 
multivariate logistic regression analysis, while mortality was examined using 
receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve and survival curve plots. Finally, 
the values of the Lac/Alb ratio and Lac/Alb × age score for assessing prognosis 
of patients with sepsis were analyzed and compared. Results: After items with 
default values were excluded, a total of 4,555 patients with sepsis were 
enrolled (2,526 males and 2,029 females). 2,843 cases were classified as the 
death group and 1,712 cases in the survival group. (1) The mean age, BMI, SOFA 
and SAPS II scores were higher in the death group than those in the survival 
group. Significant differences in baseline data between the two groups were also 
observed. (2) The patients in the death group were divided further into four 
subgroups according to the quartile of the Lac/Alb ratio from low to high. 
Comparison of the four subgroups showed that the death rate rose with an 
increase in the Lac/Alb ratio, while analysis of the survival curve revealed 
that patients with a higher Lac/Alb ratio had a worse prognosis. (3) 
Multivariate logistic regression analysis showed that age ≥ 60 years, overweight 
(BMI ≥ 24 kg/m2), Lac/Alb ratio ≥ 0.16, SOFA score ≥ 2 points, and SAPS II ≥ 40 
points were independent risk factors for death in patients with septic. (4) ROC 
curve analysis indicated that the SAPS II, Lac/Alb x age score, SOFA, and 
Lac/Alb ratio were the best predictors of death in patients with sepsis. The 
Lac/Alb × age score was characterized by its simple acquisition and ability to 
quickly analyze the prognosis of patients. Conclusion: (1)A high Lac/Alb ratio 
is an independent risk factor for death in patients with sepsis. (2) Although 
the prognosis of sepsis can be accurately and comprehensively assessed by 
multi-dimensional analysis of multiple indices, the Lac/Alb × age score is more 
accurate and convenient for providing a general assessment of prognosis, so is 
worthy of further clinical recognition.

Elevated lactate levels are common in sepsis patients. This study aimed to 
assess the effect of dynamic changes in lactate levels within the first 24 hours 
following admission on patient prognosis. We extracted data from the Medical 
Information Mart for Intensive Care (MIMIC)-IV database and classified patients 
using latent class growth analysis (LCGA). This analysis classified sepsis 
patients into different groups based on dynamic changes in lactate levels during 
the initial 24 hours post-admission, dividing this time frame into four periods 
(0-3 h, 3-6 h, 6-12 h, and 12-24 h). The highest lactate level recorded in each 
period was then used for patient classification. We subsequently compared the 
baseline characteristics and outcomes between these different groups. Our study 
encompassed 7,830 patients, whom LCGA successfully divided into two classes: 
class 1 (steady lactate class) and class 2 (increasing lactate class). Class 2 
demonstrated a worse clinical status at baseline, as indicated by vital signs, 
disease severity scores, and laboratory results. Importantly, class 2 also had a 
significantly higher 28-day mortality rate than class 1 (55.6% vs 13.5%, P < 
0.001). In conclusion, LCGA effectively categorized sepsis patients into two 
distinct groups based on their dynamic changes in lactate levels during the 
first 24 hours post-admission. This methodology has potential utility in 
clinical practice for managing sepsis patients.

BACKGROUND Sepsis-associated acute kidney injury (SA-AKI) is linked to high 
mortality rates and an unfavorable prognosis. Early identification of patients 
with poor prognosis is crucial. This study aimed to investigate the relationship 
between the systemic immune-inflammation index (SII) and mortality in this 
specific patient population. MATERIAL AND METHODS This retrospective cohort 
study used data from the Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care IV 
database. Data on patient demographics, comorbidities, vital signs, laboratory 
parameters, treatment usage, acute kidney injury staging, and renal replacement 
therapy were collected within 48 h of intensive care unit admission. Restricted 
cubic splines, Kaplan-Meier curves, and Cox regression models were used for 
analysis. Stratified analyses were performed on the basis of various factors. 
RESULTS In total, 7856 patients were included, with a median age of 66.9 years 
and a male-to-female ratio of 57.7%-42.3%. A J-shaped relationship was observed 
between SII and mortality risk. The lowest mortality risk occurred at an SII of 
760.078×10⁹/L. Compared to the reference group (second quartile of SII), the 
highest and third quartiles had increased 28-day mortality risk, with adjusted 
hazard ratios (HRs) of 1.33 (1.16-1.52) and 1.55 (1.36-1.77), respectively. 
Although a trend towards higher mortality hazard was observed in the lowest SII 
group (Q1), it was not statistically significant, with an adjusted HR of 1.15 
(1-1.32). CONCLUSIONS In patients with SA-AKI, both low and high SII were 
associated with increased short-term mortality risk. The lowest mortality risk 
was observed at an SII of 760.078×10⁹/L within a 28-day period.

BACKGROUND: In 2023, the European Society of Intensive Care Medicine (ESICM) 
recommended updated criteria for acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). In 
2024, Matthay et al. updated the global ARDS definition in AJRCCM, titled "A New 
Global Definition of Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome." However, the impact 
of this new definition on ARDS treatments is currently unknown.
OBJECTIVE: This study aims to determine the effect of the new ARDS definition on 
patients with hypoxemic respiratory failure and study the heterogeneity of 
patients in the new definition to guide treatment.
METHODS: Clinical consultation data from the Medical Information Mart for 
Intensive Care IV database were extracted using Structured Query Language based 
on the PostgreSQL tool (version 10.0). Data were analyzed using Python (version 
3.9) and the deep learning framework Pytorch. Kaplan-Meier survival analysis was 
used to compare survival between the old and new definitions. A hierarchical 
clustering approach was applied to identify potential ARDS clinical subtypes.
RESULTS: The new definition diagnosed ARDS earlier and included individuals with 
lower mortality rates compared with the Berlin definition. Patients meeting the 
new definition but not the Berlin criteria exhibited a favorable response to 
non-invasive ventilation strategies (p = 0.009). The XGBoost classifier, trained 
to predict subphenotypes, achieved an AUC of 0.88 ± 0.02 on the training set. 
Additionally, mortality was significantly associated with patients with 
hypoxemia compared with survivors, particularly regarding respiratory 
parameters. Easily accessible metrics, such as respiratory rate and urea 
nitrogen (BUN), can help diagnose ARDS in high-risk populations in 
resource-limited settings.
CONCLUSIONS: The new ARDS definition offers advantages in earlier detection, 
more accurate grading, and more precise diagnosis in resource-limited settings 
compared with the Berlin definition. This study also established a robust 
prediction model for early ARDS identification, improving the patient prognosis 
and reducing the mortality rate.

BACKGROUND: Aspiration pneumonia (AP) is a common complication in the intensive 
care unit (ICU), which is associated with significantly increased morbidity and 
mortality and has a significant impact on patient prognosis. Antibiotics are 
commonly used in the clinical treatment of AP. However, the prognostic impact of 
antibiotics on patients with AP has not been adequately characterized. The 
purpose of this study is to illustrate the relationship between the use of 
antibiotics and in-hospital mortality of AP patients, as well as to analyze the 
effects of different antibiotic treatment regimens on the prognosis of the 
patients, and to further understand the distribution of pathogens and drug 
resistance in AP patients, so as to provide guidance information for the 
rational use of medication for patients in the clinic.
METHODS: Clinical data of AP patients were extracted from the MIMIC-IV database. 
Statistical methods included multivariate logistic regression, propensity score 
matching (PSM), and inverse probability weighting (IPW) based on propensity 
scores to ensure the robustness of the findings. In addition, the 
characteristics of the medications used by patients with AP were described using 
statistical graphs and tables.
RESULTS: A total of 4132 patients with AP were included. In-hospital mortality 
was significantly lower in the group using antibiotics compared to the group not 
using antibiotics (odds ratio [OR] = 0.44, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.27- 
0.71, P = 0.001). Furthermore, in the group using mechanical ventilation (MV), 
antibiotics use significantly reduced in-hospital mortality (OR = 0.30, 95% CI 
0.15-0.57, P < 0.001). Vancomycin and cephalosporins are the most commonly used 
antibiotics to treat AP. Specifically, vancomycin in combination with 
piperacillin-tazobactam was used most frequently with 396 cases. The highest 
survival rate (97.6\%) was observed in patients treated with levofloxacin 
combined with metronidazole. Additionally, vancomycin combined with 
piperacillin-tazobactam had many inflammation related features that differed 
significantly from those in patients who did not receive medication.
CONCLUSIONS: Antibiotics use is closely associated with lower in-hospital 
mortality in ICU patients with AP. Moreover, understanding antibiotics use, the 
composition of pathogenic bacteria, and the rates of drug resistance in patients 
with AP can aid in disease prevention and prompt infection control.

Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) is a chronic metabolic disorder, and critically 
ill patients with T2DM in intensive care unit (ICU) have an increased risk of 
mortality. In this study, we investigated the relationship between nine 
inflammatory indicators and prognosis in critically ill patients with T2DM to 
provide a clinical reference for assessing the prognosis of patients admitted to 
the ICU. Critically ill patients with T2DM were extracted from the Medical 
Information Mart for Intensive Care-IV (MIMIC-IV) database and divided into 
training and testing sets (7:3 ratio). An external validation cohort was 
collected from a single center in China using identical criteria. Logistic and 
Cox regression analyses were used to evaluate the relationship between nine 
inflammatory indicators and ICU, 30-day, and 90-day mortality rates. Significant 
predictive variables were chosen using least absolute shrinkage selection 
operator (LASSO) regression from logistic regression results, and a prognostic 
prediction model was built with multivariate logistic regression. The model was 
validated in both test and external validation sets. A total of 4,783 patients 
were included for model development and testing; an additional 204 served as the 
external validation set. The levels of eight inflammatory indicators were 
significantly correlated with short-term prognosis in critically ill patients 
with T2DM (P < 0.05 for all). The prediction model showed excellent 
discrimination performance, with AUC values of 0.825 (95% CI, 0.785-0.864) in 
the test set and 0.741 (95% CI, 0.630-0.851) in the external validation set. 
Calibration curves demonstrated strong consistency in both sets. In addition, 
decision curve analysis showed a net clinical benefit within 1-60% threshold 
probability in the test set and 10-41% threshold probability in the external 
validation set. Eight inflammatory indicators were identified as independent 
risk factors for prognosis in critically ill patients with T2DM. The prediction 
model showed promising performance in both internal and external validation 
cohorts, highlighting its potential as a valuable tool for early risk 
stratification and prediction of the outcomes of personalized treatment 
strategies in ICU settings.

BACKGROUND: Accumulation of iron is associated with oxidative stress, 
inflammation, and regulated cell death processes that contribute to the 
development of acute kidney injury (AKI). We aimed to investigate the 
association between serum iron levels and prognosis in intensive care unit (ICU) 
patients with AKI.
METHODS: A total of 483 patients with AKI defined as per the Kidney Disease: 
Improving Global Guidelines were included in this retrospective study. The data 
was extracted from the single-centre Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care 
III database. AKI patients with serum iron parameters measured upon ICU 
admission were included and divided into two groups (low group and high group). 
The prognostic value of serum iron was analysed using univariate and 
multivariate Cox regression analysis.
RESULTS: The optimal cut-off value for serum iron was calculated to be 60 μg/dl. 
Univariable Cox regression analysis showed that serum iron levels were 
significantly correlated with prognosis of AKI patients. After adjusting for 
possible confounding variables, serum iron levels higher than 60 μg/dl were 
associated with increases in 28-day (hazard [HR] 1.832; P <  0.001) and 90-day 
(HR 1.741; P <  0.001) mortality, as per multivariable Cox regression analysis.
CONCLUSIONS: High serum iron levels were associated with increased short- and 
long-term mortality in ICU patients with AKI. Serum iron levels measured upon 
admission may be used for predicting prognosis in AKI patients.

Background: Acute myocardial infarction (AMI) is still the most serious 
manifestation of coronary artery disease. Systolic blood pressure (SBP) is the 
best predictor of blood pressure in AMI. Thus, its influence on AMI is necessary 
to be explored. Methods: A total of 4,277 patients with AMI were extracted from 
the Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care database. Chi-square test or 
Student's t-test was used to judge differences between groups, and Cox 
regression was used to identify factors that affect AMI prognosis. SBP was 
classified as low (<90 mmHg), normal (90-140 mmHg), or high (>140 mmHg), and a 
non-linear test was performed. Meaningful variables were incorporated into 
models for sensitivity analysis. Patient age was classified as low and high for 
subgroup analysis, and the cutoff value of the trajectory was identified. P < 
0.05 indicates statistical significance. Results: The effect of SBP on the 
prognosis of patients with AMI is non-linear. The risks in models 1-3 with low 
SBP are 6.717, 4.910, and 3.080 times those of the models with normal SBP, 
respectively. The risks in models 1-3 with high SBP are 1.483, 1.637, and 2.937 
times those of the models with normal SBP, respectively. The cutoff point (95% 
confidence interval) of the trajectory is 114.489 mmHg (111.275-117.702 mmHg, 
all P < 0.001). Conclusions: SBP has a non-linear effect on AMI prognosis. Low 
and high SBP show risks, and the risk of low SBP is obviously greater than that 
of high SBP.

BACKGROUND: Recent research has revealed the potential value of machine learning 
(ML) models in improving prognostic prediction for patients with trauma. ML can 
enhance predictions and identify which factors contribute the most to 
posttraumatic mortality. However, no studies have explored the risk factors, 
complications, and risk prediction of preoperative and postoperative traumatic 
coagulopathy (PPTIC) in patients with trauma.
OBJECTIVE: This study aims to help clinicians implement timely and appropriate 
interventions to reduce the incidence of PPTIC and related complications, 
thereby lowering in-hospital mortality and disability rates for patients with 
trauma.
METHODS: We analyzed data from 13,235 patients with trauma from 4 medical 
centers, including medical histories, laboratory results, and hospitalization 
complications. We developed 10 ML models in Python (Python Software Foundation) 
to predict PPTIC based on preoperative indicators. Data from 10,023 Medical 
Information Mart for Intensive Care patients were divided into training (70%) 
and test (30%) sets, with 3212 patients from 3 other centers used for external 
validation. Model performance was assessed with 5-fold cross-validation, 
bootstrapping, Brier score, and Shapley additive explanation values.
RESULTS: Univariate logistic regression identified PPTIC risk factors as (1) 
prolonged activated partial thromboplastin time, prothrombin time, and 
international normalized ratio; (2) decreased levels of hemoglobin, hematocrit, 
red blood cells, calcium, and sodium; (3) lower admission diastolic blood 
pressure; (4) elevated alanine aminotransferase and aspartate aminotransferase 
levels; (5) admission heart rate; and (6) emergency surgery and perioperative 
transfusion. Multivariate logistic regression revealed that patients with PPTIC 
faced significantly higher risks of sepsis (1.75-fold), heart failure 
(1.5-fold), delirium (3.08-fold), abnormal coagulation (3.57-fold), tracheostomy 
(2.76-fold), mortality (2.19-fold), and urinary tract infection (1.95-fold), 
along with longer hospital and intensive care unit stays. Random forest was the 
most effective ML model for predicting PPTIC, achieving an area under the 
receiver operating characteristic of 0.91, an area under the 
precision-recall curve of 0.89, accuracy of 0.84, sensitivity of 0.80, 
specificity of 0.88, precision of 0.88, F1-score of 0.84, and Brier score of 
0.13 in external validation.
CONCLUSIONS: Key PPTIC risk factors include (1) prolonged activated partial 
thromboplastin time, prothrombin time, and international normalized ratio; (2) 
low levels of hemoglobin, hematocrit, red blood cells, calcium, and sodium; (3) 
low diastolic blood pressure; (4) elevated alanine aminotransferase and 
aspartate aminotransferase levels; (5) admission heart rate; and (6) the need 
for emergency surgery and transfusion. PPTIC is associated with severe 
complications and extended hospital stays. Among the ML models, the random 
forest model was the most effective predictor.

BACKGROUND: The role of longitudinal platelet count trajectories in critically 
ill patients with thrombocytopenia is unclear. This study aimed to identify the 
association between trajectory patterns and prognosis and assess whether these 
patterns could enhance the predictive capability of Acute Physiology and Chronic 
Health Evaluation (APACHE) IV or Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (SOFA) 
scores for mortality.
METHODS: This retrospective cohort study employed latent growth mixture modeling 
(LGMM) to identify platelet count trajectory patterns. Cox proportional hazards 
model was used to evaluate the association between the patterns and mortality. 
Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) curves were plotted, and the areas under 
the curves (AUCs) were compared between models using the APACHE IV or SOFA score 
alone and those incorporating trajectory patterns.
RESULTS: A total of 1683 patients from the eICU Collaborative Research Database 
(eICU-CRD) and 931 patients from the Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care 
IV (MIMIC-IV) database were included. Two trajectory patterns were identified: 
Class 1, characterized by "Gradual increase," and Class 2, with "Persistent 
low." Patients in Class 2 had higher ICU mortality (eICU-CRD: 
2.273[1.457-3.546]; MIMIC-IV database: 1.991[1.162-3.412]). Incorporating 
trajectory patterns into the APACHE IV or SOFA scores substantially enhanced the 
AUC of these scoring systems alone in predicting ICU mortality (eICU-CRD: 
P < 0.001; MIMIC-IV database: P = 0.0018).
CONCLUSION: The longitudinal platelet count trajectory patterns are 
complementary predictors of survival in critically ill patients with 
thrombocytopenia. Persistently low platelet counts are significantly associated 
with unfavorable clinical outcomes.

OBJECTIVES: Sepsis-associated encephalopathy (SAE) has a high incidence and 
mortality, especially for elderly patients and patients who are positive for 
pathogenic microbial infection, this study explored the prognostic factors 
influencing the prognosis of elderly patients with pathogenic microorganisms 
positive of sepsis-associated encephalopathy.
METHODS: Patients with SAE and pathogenic microbiology positive were included in 
this study from Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care IV (MIMIC IV) 
database. The main results of this study was analyzed the 28-day mortality rate 
of patients with pathogenic microorganism positive and SAE by Wilcoxon, 
Kaplan-Meier curve and other methods.
RESULTS: This study found that older patients with SAE had higher mortality at 
28 and 90 days compared with non-older patients with SAE. Klebsiella pneumoniae 
and Pseudomonas aeruginosa infection, the level of APTT and lactate and SAPS III 
score were independent risk factors for 28-day mortality in elderly patients 
with SAE, among them, Klebsiella pneumoniae and Pseudomonas aeruginosa infection 
had the best sensitivity (0.893; 0.931) in assessing elderly patients with 
pathogenic microorganisms positive and SAE; the SAPS III score had the highest 
AUC (0.681) value and specificity (0.761) in assessing elderly patients with 
pathogenic microorganisms positive and SAE.
CONCLUSION: The older patients with SAE had a poor prognosis, the elder patients 
with pathogenic microorganisms positive and SAE with high levels of APTT and 
lactate and SAPS III score and Klebsiella pneumoniae and Pseudomonas aeruginosa 
infection should be closely monitored and treated aggressively.

We aimed to determine the association between anion gap-to-calcium ratio (ACR) 
and 30-day mortality in sepsis patients with diabetes mellitus (DM). Data for 
sepsis patients diagnosed with DM was extracted from Medical Information Mart 
for Intensive Care Database IV. After screening, 4429 eligible subjects were 
included in our study finally. The receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve 
was used to determine the cut-off value. According to the ROC curve analysis, 
the ACR demonstrated a higher area under the curve (AUC) of 0.622 compared to AG 
(0.598). Multivariable logistic regression with inverse probability of treatment 
weighting (IPTW) based on propensity score were used to detect the association 
between ACR and 30-day mortality. Our results showed that the patients with the 
high level of ACR had a higher risk of death within 30 days compared with those 
with low level of ACR (odds ratio 1.342, 95% confidence interval 1.180-1.526, 
P < 0.001). In a word, our results suggest that ACR may be an independent 
prognostic indicator for death with 30 days in critically ill patients with 
sepsis and DM.

PURPOSE: Previous studies showed that long-term use of proton pump inhibitors 
(PPIs) was associated with cardiovascular events. However, the impact of 
short-term PPI exposure on intensive care unit (ICU) patients with myocardial 
infarction (MI) remains largely unknown. This study aims to determine the 
precise correlation between short-term PPI usage during hospitalization and 
prognostic outcomes of ICU-admitted MI patients using Medical Information Mart 
for Intensive Care IV database (MIMIC-IV).
METHODS: Propensity score matching (PSM) was applied to adjust confounding 
factors. The primary study outcome was rehospitalization with mortality and 
length of stay as secondary outcomes. Binary logistic, multivariable Cox, and 
linear regression analyses were employed to estimate the impact of short-term 
PPI exposure on ICU-admitted MI patients.
RESULTS: A total of 7249 patients were included, involving 3628 PPI users and 
3621 non-PPI users. After PSM, 2687 pairs of patients were matched. The results 
demonstrated a significant association between PPI exposure and increased risk 
of rehospitalization for MI in both univariate and multivariate [odds ratio 
(OR) = 1.157, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.020-1.313] analyses through 
logistic regression after PSM. Furthermore, this risk was also observed in 
patients using PPIs > 7 days, despite decreased risk of all-cause mortality 
among these patients. It was also found that pantoprazole increased the risk of 
rehospitalization, whereas omeprazole did not.
CONCLUSION: Short-term PPI usage during hospitalization was still associated 
with higher risk of rehospitalization for MI in ICU-admitted MI patients. 
Furthermore, omeprazole might be superior to pantoprazole regarding the risk of 
rehospitalization in ICU-admitted MI patients.

The association of the international normalized ratio (INR) with the long-term 
clinical outcome of patients who undergo endarterectomy has not yet been 
studied. The present study therefore primarily aimed to evaluate the association 
of INR on admission with the 90-day mortality of critically ill patients who 
underwent endarterectomy during hospitalization. The Medical Information Mart 
for Intensive Care III database was queried for patients undergoing 
endarterectomy. The 90-day mortality of patients was selected as a primary 
endpoint. Receiver-operating characteristic (ROC) curves were plotted to present 
the accuracy of predictions. Kaplan-Meier curves and multivariate Cox regression 
analysis were performed to analyse associations. Propensity score matching (PSM) 
was also conducted to reduce confounding bias. A total of 230 patients were 
included, with 36 90-day non-survivors. Patients with a high INR (≥1.5) on 
admission exhibited a higher 90-day mortality than those with a low INR (<1.5; 
29.09 vs. 11.43%; P=0.003). The ROC area under the curve value was 0.687 [95% 
confidence interval (CI), 0.571-0.780]. Kaplan-Meier plots identified divergence 
in survival between patients with different INR levels (log-rank test, 
P=0.0013). The results of the multivariate Cox regression analysis indicated 
that a high INR level was significantly associated with 90-day mortality (hazard 
ratio, 2.19; 95% CI, 1.08-4.45; P=0.0305). Analysis of the PSM cohort presented 
similar results. In conclusion, the INR levels of critically ill patients who 
undergo endarterectomy may be used to stratify their risk of 90-day mortality.

BACKGROUND: Acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) is a severe inflammatory 
disorder of the lungs and is associated with oxidative damage. However, red 
blood cell distribution width (RDW), as an indicator of body response to 
inflammation and oxidative stress, has not been studied for its relationship 
with ARDS as diagnosed by the Berlin definition.
OBJECTIVES: To examine the value of RDW in predicting the prognosis of in 
patients with ARDS.
METHODS: This is a retrospective study based on the Medical Information Mart for 
Intensive Care III (MIMIC-III) database. Berlin-defined ARDS patients using 
mechanical ventilation for more than 48 hours were selected using structured 
query language. The primary statistical methods were propensity score matching 
and sensitivity analysis, including an inverse probability weighting model to 
ensure the robustness of our findings.
RESULTS: A total of 529 intensive care unit (ICU) patients with ARDS according 
to the Berlin definition were enrolled in the study. The adjusted OR showed an 
adverse effect between the higher RDW group and 30-day mortality [OR 2.33, 95% 
CI (1.15-4.75), P=0.019]. However, we found that length of ICU stay was not 
related to RDW (P=0.167), and in the anaemia group, RDW was poorly predictive of 
30-day mortality (P=0.307).
CONCLUSION: In unselected ARDS patients, higher RDW was associated with higher 
30-day mortality rate. Further investigation is required to validate this 
relationship with prospectively collected data.

Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is a chronic inflammatory lung 
disease, and inflammation plays a key role in the pathogenesis of COPD. The aim 
of this study is to investigate the association between systemic immune 
inflammation index (SII), systemic inflammatory response index (SIRI),pan-immune 
inflammation value (PIV), neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio (NLR), and 
platelet-to-lymphocyte ratio (PLR) and all-cause mortality in patients with 
chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), and to evaluate the effect of 
composite inflammatory markers on the prognosis of COPD patients. We obtained 
data on COPD patients from the Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care 
(MIMIC) -IV database and divided patients into four groups based on quartiles of 
baseline levels of inflammatory markers, The primary outcomes were in-hospital 
and ICU mortality. We comprehensively explored the association between composite 
inflammatory markers and mortality in patients with COPD using restricted cubic 
splints (RCS), COX proportional hazards regression models, Kaplan-Meier curves, 
receiver operating characteristic (ROC), and subgroup analyses. A total of 1234 
COPD patients were included in this study. RCS results showed that SII, SIRI, 
PLR, PIV and NLR were positively and non-linearly correlated with the increased 
risk of in-hospital mortality in COPD patients. Multivariate COX regression 
analysis showed that compound inflammatory markers were independent risk factors 
for in-hospital mortality in COPD patients. The KM curve results showed that 
COPD patients with higher SII, SIRI, PLR and PIV had a significantly lower 
survival probability. 5 kinds of compound between inflammatory markers and 
mortality in patients with COPD is related to nonlinear correlation, can 
increase the risk of mortality in patients with COPD is a risk factor for the 
prognosis of patients with COPD, and may serve as potential biomarkers for 
clinical COPD risk stratification and treatment management in critical patients.

BACKGROUND: Propofol and midazolam have been widely used in patients with 
sepsis. However, the effectiveness of these drugs in reducing the duration of 
mechanical ventilation and the risk of mortality remains controversial.
OBJECTIVES: To investigate and compare effects of propofol and midazolam on 
30-day mortality in patients with sepsis-associated encephalopathy (SAE).
MATERIAL AND METHODS: A retrospective cohort study was conducted on data from 
952 adult patients with SAE extracted from the Medical Information Mart for 
Intensive Care IV (MIMIC-IV) database. Univariable and multivariable Cox 
proportional hazard models were utilized to investigate the associations of 
propofol and midazolam with 30-day mortality; and univariable and multivariable 
logistic regression analyses were used to explore the relationships of propofol 
and midazolam with ventilation duration. The outcome measures were hazard ratios 
(HRs), odds ratios (ORs), and 95% confidence intervals (95% CIs). In addition, 
subgroup analyses of age, simplified acute physiological score (SAPS)-II, 
Charlson Comorbidity Index (CCI), and ventilation duration were also performed 
to further assess the associations of propofol and midazolam with 30-day 
mortality.
RESULTS: Among eligible patients, 265 (27.84%) died within 30 days. After 
adjusting for covariates, treatment with propofol was associated with both lower 
risk of 30-day mortality (HR = 0.67, 95% CI: 0.51-0.88) and lower odds of 
prolonged ventilation duration (OR = 0.71, 95% CI: 0.53-0.96) compared to 
treatment with midazolam. Moreover, the negative association between treatment 
with propofol and 30-day mortality was also significant in subgroups of age ≥65 
years, SAPS-II score ≥47, CCI score ≥3, and ventilation duration ≥5 days (all p 
< 0.05).
CONCLUSIONS: Among patients with SAE, treatment with propofol was relatively 
more effective than treatment with midazolam in reducing the risk of 30-day 
mortality and the duration of mechanical ventilation. However, the causal 
relationships of propofol and midazolam with prognosis in patients with SAE need 
further clarification.

It is unclear whether activated partial thromboplastin time (APTT) is predictive 
of survival in patients with acute pancreatitis (AP). Our study aimed to 
investigate the relationship between APTT and short-term prognosis in AP. From 
the Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care (MIMIC)-IV database, a total of 
844 patients with AP were randomly divided into the training cohort (n = 591) 
and the validation cohort (n = 253) at a ratio of 7:3. Based on their APTT 
values, the patients were divided into the normal and high groups. The primary 
outcome of this study was 30- and 60-day survival. Kaplan-Meier survival 
analysis and Cox regression models were used to analyze associations between 
groups and outcomes. The training and validation cohort matched well on all 
parameters (p > 0.05). In terms of 30- and 60-day survival, Kaplan-Meier 
survival curves from both training and validation cohorts demonstrated a lower 
survival probability for patients in the high APTT group than the normal group 
(log-rank p < 0.05). In the training cohort, patients in the high APTT group had 
a statistically significantly higher risk of death than those in the normal 
group after controlling for possible confounders in Cox regression (p < 0.05). 
For the high APTT group, the hazard ratios (95% confidence interval [CI]) were 
1.63 (95% CI 1.10, 2.61, p = 0.035) and 1.49 (95% CI 1.01, 2.38, p = 0.041), 
respectively. APTT performed as well as BISAP, Ranson, and APACHE II models in 
predicting 30- and 60-day survival in patients with AP. The results above have 
been verified in the validation cohort. Prolonged APTT in patients with AP may 
increase the risk of short-term death.

Retrospective Analysis: Exploring Transfusion Thresholds' Impact on Patients 
with Sepsis and Renal Failure.

Zhao H, Cheng H, Huang C, Huang M, Li D, Mei F.

BACKGROUND: Sepsis with renal failure is a common condition in intensive care 
units (ICUs) and is associated with poor prognosis. A unified consensus on the 
optimal transfusion hemoglobin concentration threshold is needed to improve 
outcomes. This study investigated the effects of different transfusion 
thresholds during hospitalization on the prognosis of patients with sepsis and 
renal failure.
METHODS: A total of 2,972 patients were included in this study. By using the 
Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care (MIMIC-IV) database, data from 
patients with sepsis and renal failure were screened and divided into a 
low-threshold group (Hb ≤ 7 g/dL) and a high-threshold group (Hb > 7 g/dL) based 
on the average hemoglobin (Hb) level 24 hours before transfusion. Univariate and 
multivariate Cox regression analyses and inverse probability weighting were used 
to compare in-hospital and ICU mortality rates between the two groups. 
Additionally, 30-day, 60-day, and 90-day survival rates, length of hospital 
stay, and ICU stay duration were evaluated.
RESULTS: Statistically significant differences in baseline characteristics were 
observed between the two groups. After propensity score matching to eliminate 
baseline characteristic differences, it was found that among the Cau¬casian 
population a higher transfusion threshold significantly reduced the risk of 
in-hospital mortality (HR, 0.774; 95% CI: 0.613 - 0.978, p < 0.05).
CONCLUSIONS: For patients with sepsis and renal failure, transfusion thresholds 
should be determined by considering the patient's race to achieve individualized 
transfusion strategies.

BACKGROUND: Comorbid congestive heart failure (CHF) was associated with worse 
prognosis in patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), while 
few studies specially investigated critically ill patients. This study 
investigated the associations between comorbid COPD with or without CHF and 
prognosis of patients admitted to intensive care units (ICU).
METHODS: We conducted a retrospective cohort study in the Medical Information 
Mart for Intensive Care III database. Adult ICU patients were included and 
categorized as patients without COPD and CHF, patients with COPD but without 
CHF, patients with CHF but without COPD, and patients with both COPD and CHF. 
The study outcomes were 28-day mortality and 90-day mortality after ICU 
admission. Kaplan-Meier curves were plotted to estimate the survival 
distributions between groups and multivariable Cox regression analyses were 
employed to evaluate the associations between comorbid COPD and/or CHF and the 
study outcomes.
RESULTS: A total of 29,589 patients were included with 20,507 patients without 
COPD and CHF, 1575 patients with COPD, 6190 patients with CHF, and 1317 patients 
with both COPD and CHF. The highest 28-day mortality rate and 90-day mortality 
rate were found in patients with both COPD and CHF (15.95% and 25.74%, 
respectively), while patients with COPD and patients with CHF had similar 
mortality rates, also observed in Kaplan-Meier curves. Compared with patients 
without COPD or CHF, comorbid COPD or CHF both significantly increased the risk 
of 28-day mortality and 90-day mortality, but comorbid COPD and CHF together was 
associated with the highest risk of mortality (hazard ratio 1.55 (95% confidence 
interval (CI) 1.33-1.80) and 1.25 (95% CI 1.16-1.35) for 28-day mortality and 
90-day mortality, respectively), while no significant interaction between COPD 
and CHF was found.
CONCLUSION: ICU patients with comorbid COPD or CHF both experienced greater 
mortalities, while these two risk factors seemed to play an independent role.

Aims: To explore the value of preoperative liver function tests (LFTs) for the 
prognosis of cardiac surgery patients without liver disease. Methods: The 
Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care III (MIMIC-III) database was used to 
extract the clinical data. Adult cardiac patients (≥18 years) without liver 
disease in the database were enrolled. The association of LFTs with the time of 
hospital stay and ICU stay was analyzed with the Spearman correlation. Survival 
curves were estimated using the Kaplan-Meier method and compared by the log-rank 
test. Multivariable logistic regression was used to identify LFTs that were 
independent prognostic factors of mortality. Results: A total of 2,565 patients 
were enrolled in this study. Albumin (ALB) was negatively associated with the 
time of hospital stay and ICU stay, while alanine transaminase (ALT), aspartate 
aminotransferase (AST), and total bilirubin were positively associated with the 
time of hospital stay and ICU stay (all p < 0.001). Abnormal ALB, ALT, AST, and 
total bilirubin were associated with lower 90-day and 4-year survival (all p < 
0.001) and could be used as independent risk factors for hospital mortality and 
90-day mortality. However, only ALB and total bilirubin were independent risk 
factors for 4-year mortality. Conclusion: Preoperative LFT abnormalities were 
associated with short-term and long-term prognosis of cardiac surgery patients 
without liver disease.

PURPOSE: Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) are increasingly 
utilized in trauma patients, particularly those with critical chest trauma who 
are susceptible to significant blood loss, leading to renal hypoperfusion. Acute 
kidney injury (AKI) is known to carry a poor prognosis in chest trauma patients. 
Therefore, investigating the potential association between NSAID use and AKI 
risk in critical patients with chest trauma is crucial.
METHODS: We selected patients admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) with 
chest trauma from the Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care III 
(MIMIC-III) dataset (2001-2012) and the Medical Information Mart for Intensive 
Care IV (MIMIC-IV) dataset (2013-2019). Propensity score matching (PSM) was used 
to match patients receiving NSAIDs with those not receiving treatment. Logistic 
regression was employed to assess the association between different types of 
NSAIDs and AKI in these patients.
RESULTS: In MIMIC-IV, NSAID use significantly increased the risk of AKI in 
critical patients with chest trauma (OR 1.99; 95% CI 1.04 to 3.85). Subgroup 
analysis revealed that aspirin significantly increased AKI risk in both 
MIMIC-III (OR 1.81; 95% CI 1.02 to 3.2) and MIMIC-IV (OR 2.47; 95% CI 1.26 to 
4.85). However, ibuprofen and ketorolac use were not associated with AKI in 
these patients.
CONCLUSION: We observed a significant association between aspirin use and an 
elevated risk of AKI in critical patients with chest trauma. These findings 
suggest that pain management strategies involving ibuprofen and ketorolac may be 
more appropriate for this patient population.

BACKGROUND: Timely and accurate prediction of short-term mortality is critical 
in intensive care units (ICUs), where patients' conditions change rapidly. 
Traditional scoring systems, such as the Simplified Acute Physiology Score and 
Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation, rely on static variables 
collected within the first 24 hours of admission and do not account for 
continuously evolving clinical states. These systems lack real-time 
adaptability, interpretability, and generalizability. With the increasing 
availability of high-frequency electronic medical record (EMR) data, machine 
learning (ML) approaches have emerged as powerful tools to model complex 
temporal patterns and support dynamic clinical decision-making. However, 
existing models are often limited by their inability to handle irregular 
sampling and missing values, and many lack rigorous external validation across 
institutions.
OBJECTIVE: We aimed to develop a real-time, interpretable risk prediction model 
that continuously assesses ICU patient mortality using irregular, longitudinal 
EMR data, with improved performance and generalizability over traditional static 
scoring systems.
METHODS: A time-aware bidirectional attention-based long short-term memory 
(TBAL) model was developed using EMR data from the MIMIC-IV (Medical Information 
Mart for Intensive Care) and eICU Collaborative Research Database (eICU-CRD) 
databases, comprising 176,344 ICU stays. The model incorporated dynamic 
variables, including vital signs, laboratory results, and medication data, 
updated hourly, to perform static and continuous mortality risk assessments. 
External cross-validation and subgroup sensitivity analyses were conducted to 
evaluate robustness and fairness. Model performance was assessed using the area 
under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUROC), area under the 
precision-recall curve (AUPRC), accuracy, and F1-score. Interpretability was 
enhanced using integrated gradients to identify key predictors.
RESULTS: For the static 12-hour to 1-day mortality prediction task, the TBAL 
model achieved AUROCs of 95.9 (95% CI 94.2-97.5) and 93.3 (95% CI 91.5-95.3) and 
AUPRCs of 48.5 and 21.6 in MIMIC-IV and eICU-CRD, respectively. Accuracy and 
F1-scores reached 94.1 and 46.7 in MIMIC-IV and 92.2 and 28.1 in eICU-CRD. In 
dynamic prediction tasks, AUROCs reached 93.6 (95% CI 93.2-93.9) and 91.9 (95% 
CI 91.6-92.1), with AUPRCs of 41.3 and 50, respectively. The model maintained 
high recall for positive cases (82.6% and 79.1% in MIMIC-IV and eICU-CRD). 
Cross-database validation yielded AUROCs of 81.3 and 76.1, confirming 
generalizability. Subgroup analysis showed stable performance across age, sex, 
and severity strata, with top predictors including lactate, vasopressor use, and 
Glasgow Coma Scale score.
CONCLUSIONS: The TBAL model offers a robust, interpretable, and generalizable 
solution for dynamic real-time mortality risk prediction in ICU patients. Its 
ability to adapt to irregular temporal patterns and to provide hourly updated 
predictions positions it as a promising decision-support tool. Future work 
should validate its utility in prospective clinical trials and investigate its 
integration into real-world ICU workflows to enhance patient outcomes.

Low blood glucose levels and high urea nitrogen levels affect patient prognosis, 
but few studies have investigated whether the blood urea nitrogen to glucose 
(BGR) ratio predicts the risk of death.This retrospective research examined the 
connection between the BGR and 365-day mortality in patients with chronic kidney 
disease (CKD) stages 1-4 admitted to an intensive care unit (ICU). The study 
utilized data from 6,380 patients in the Medical Information Mart for Intensive 
Care IV version 2.2 (MIMIC-IV v2.2), taking into account confounding factors 
such as demographics, vital signs, laboratory indicators, and comorbidities. The 
study employed both univariate and multivariate Cox regression analyses 
stratified by BGR quartiles. Additionally, restricted cubic spline regression 
and inflection point analysis were used to explore the linear relationship 
between BGR and 365-day mortality, while Kaplan-Meier curve analysis was used to 
observe mortality changes under different BGR stratifications. Subgroup and 
mediating effect analyses were performed to evaluate the robustness of BGR's 
effect on 365-day mortality. The study found a cumulative 365-day mortality rate 
of 34.2% among CKD stages 1-4 patients, with a 2.43-fold increase in the risk of 
death associated with BGR and at least a 44% increase in the risk of death for 
each unit increase in BGR (P = 0.022). A significant nonlinear relationship was 
identified, showing a stepwise change in the risk of death with a marked 
increase in the slope of the curve for BGR values below 0.52 and above 0.9 
(P < 0.001). Subgroup analyses indicated interactions between BGR and factors 
such as age, sepsis, first-day antibiotic use, and cerebrovascular disease 
(P < 0.05). In conclusion, this study confirms that BGR is a significant and 
stable predictor of 1-year mortality risk in patients with CKD stages 1-4. 
Interventions aimed at timely adjustment, correction of metabolic imbalances, 
reduction of inflammation, and management of BGR levels are beneficial for 
reducing mortality in this patient population.

MOTIVATION: Electronic health records (EHRs) represent a comprehensive resource 
of a patient's medical history. EHRs are essential for utilizing advanced 
technologies such as deep learning (DL), enabling healthcare providers to 
analyze extensive data, extract valuable insights, and make precise and 
data-driven clinical decisions. DL methods such as recurrent neural networks 
(RNN) have been utilized to analyze EHR to model disease progression and predict 
diagnosis. However, these methods do not address some inherent irregularities in 
EHR data such as irregular time intervals between clinical visits. Furthermore, 
most DL models are not interpretable. In this study, we propose two 
interpretable DL architectures based on RNN, namely time-aware RNN (TA-RNN) and 
TA-RNN-autoencoder (TA-RNN-AE) to predict patient's clinical outcome in EHR at 
the next visit and multiple visits ahead, respectively. To mitigate the impact 
of irregular time intervals, we propose incorporating time embedding of the 
elapsed times between visits. For interpretability, we propose employing a 
dual-level attention mechanism that operates between visits and features within 
each visit.
RESULTS: The results of the experiments conducted on Alzheimer's Disease 
Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) and National Alzheimer's Coordinating Center 
(NACC) datasets indicated the superior performance of proposed models for 
predicting Alzheimer's Disease (AD) compared to state-of-the-art and baseline 
approaches based on F2 and sensitivity. Additionally, TA-RNN showed superior 
performance on the Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care (MIMIC-III) 
dataset for mortality prediction. In our ablation study, we observed enhanced 
predictive performance by incorporating time embedding and attention mechanisms. 
Finally, investigating attention weights helped identify influential visits and 
features in predictions.

Red blood cell distribution width (RDW) and neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio (NLR) 
have shown a prognostic value in various clinical settings. We aimed to 
investigate the association between RDW, NLR, and in-hospital mortality in 
patients with dyspnea. In this retrospective study with the Medical Information 
Mart for Intensive Care III database (version 1.4), adult patients who came to 
the emergency department with dyspnea were included. Patients' comorbidities, 
hematological parameters within the first 48 hours after admission to the 
emergency department, and in-hospital mortality were extracted. The 
relationships between RDW, NLR, and in-hospital mortality were analyzed with the 
receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis and multivariate logistic 
regression model. We found that hospital survivors had significantly lower NLR 
than those who died. However, RDW was not significantly increased in patients 
who died during the hospitalization. The area under the ROC curve of NLR for 
predicting in-hospital mortality was 0.62. On multivariate analysis, NLR was not 
independently associated with in-hospital mortality. On further analysis, 
lymphocyte percentage was independently associated with in-hospital mortality, 
with an odds ratio of 0.56. Therefore, we concluded that RDW and NLR are not 
reliable parameters to predict in-hospital mortality in critically ill patients 
admitted to the emergency department with dyspnea.

Republic of China.

BACKGROUND: Sepsis is a life-threatening and inflammatory disease with high 
morbidity and mortality. Red blood cell distribution width to platelet count 
ratio (RPR) was known as an inflammatory biomarker and was related to poor 
outcomes of various diseases.
AIM: This study was intended to explore the association between RPR and 
mortality of sepsis patients.
METHODS: A retrospective cohort study was undertaken in patients with sepsis, 
and the data were collected from a public database called Medical Information 
Mart for Intensive Care III (MIMIC-III). The primary outcome was 28-day 
mortality while the secondary outcomes were 90-day mortality and ICU mortality. 
Multivariable regression analyses, as well as interaction and stratified 
analyses, were conducted to investigate the relation between RPR and sepsis 
mortality.
RESULTS: In total, we enrolled 7531 patients with 1316 deaths. RPR was 
independently correlated with 28-day mortality (per 0.1 increase: HR=1.04; 95% 
CI 1.02-1.06), 90-day mortality (per 0.1 increase: HR=1.04; 95% CI 1.03-1.06) 
and ICU mortality (per 0.1 increase: OR=1.06; 95% CI 1.02-1.10). 
Twenty-eight-day survival was worse in the high RPR (≥0.134) group according to 
the Kaplan-Meier curve analyses (Log rank test, p<0.001). In stratified 
analyses, Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (SOFA) score and length of ICU 
stay had interactive effects with the high RPR (≥0.134) group on 28-day 
mortality.
CONCLUSION: RPR is a novel biomarker that indicates poor prognosis of sepsis 
patients. Clinicians are required to pay more attention to those patients with 
high RPR.

The increasing accumulation of healthcare data provides researchers with ample 
opportunities to build machine learning approaches for clinical decision support 
and to improve the quality of health care. Several studies have developed 
conventional machine learning approaches that rely heavily on manual feature 
engineering and result in task-specific models for health care. In contrast, 
healthcare researchers have begun to use deep learning, which has emerged as a 
revolutionary machine learning technique that obviates manual feature 
engineering but still achieves impressive results in research fields such as 
image classification. However, few of them have addressed the lack of the 
interpretability of deep learning models although interpretability is essential 
for the successful adoption of machine learning approaches by healthcare 
communities. In addition, the unique characteristics of healthcare data such as 
high dimensionality and temporal dependencies pose challenges for building 
models on healthcare data. To address these challenges, we develop a gated 
recurrent unit-based recurrent neural network with hierarchical attention for 
mortality prediction, and then, using the diagnostic codes from the Medical 
Information Mart for Intensive Care, we evaluate the model. We find that the 
prediction accuracy of the model outperforms baseline models and demonstrate the 
interpretability of the model in visualizations.

BACKGROUND: The measurement of Braden score can be used as a useful tool for 
clinical care. However, the relationship between the Braden score and clinical 
outcomes in sepsis patients remains unclear. This study aims to investigate the 
association between the Braden score and clinical outcomes in sepsis patients.
METHODS: The Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care III (MIMIC-III) 
database was searched to identify patients with sepsis who had their Braden 
score measured. The primary outcomes were 28-day, 60-day, and 90-day mortality. 
Multivariate Cox regression analysis was used to clarify the relationship 
between Braden score and primary outcomes, and Kaplan-Meier survival analysis 
and stratified analysis were used to verify our findings.
RESULTS: A total of 8,290 patients were included in our study, during the 
28-day, 60-day, and 90-day follow-up periods, mortality was recorded in 1,554, 
1,938, and 2,173 patients, those with lower Braden score had a 58% increased 
risk of 28-day mortality (hazard ratio [HR] 1.58; 95% confidence interval [CI] 
1.38, 1.81), a 50% increased risk of 60-day mortality(HR 1.50; 95% CI 
1.33,1.70), and a 52% increased risk of 90-day mortality(HR 1.52; 95% CI 
1.35,1.70). Patients with lower Braden score received more mechanical 
ventilation and vasopressors, and presented with elevated WBC counts and lactate 
levels. In addition, lower Braden scores were also linked to increased adjusted 
ICU mortality and a higher incidence of AKI within the first seven days 
following ICU admission.
CONCLUSION: Lower Braden score is an independent risk factor for mortality in 
critically ill patients with sepsis. Braden score can be used as a potential 
indicator for assessing outcomes in such patients.

BACKGROUND: Although some underpowered studies have proven that increased red 
blood cell distribution width (RDW) may be associated with short-term prognosis 
of sepsis, the long-term prognostic value of RDW remains largely unknown.
METHODS: This retrospective observational study was based on the Medical 
Information Mart for Intensive Care III (MIMIC III), a large critical care 
database. Baseline RDW and conventional disease severity scores were extracted 
along with data on 4-year mortality, of adult patients with severe sepsis upon 
first admission to the intensive care unit (ICU). The prognostic value of RDW 
was analyzed with Kapan-Meier cure, Cox model, receiver operating characteristic 
(ROC) curve analysis, net reclassification index (NRI) and integrated 
discriminatory index (IDI).
RESULTS: A total of 4264 subjects were included. The area under ROC curve of RDW 
for predicting 4-year mortality was 0.64 (95% CI: 0.63-0.66). In multivariable 
Cox model, increased RDW was independently associated with all-cause mortality, 
irrespective of anemia. With conventional severity scores as reference, RDW had 
continuous NRI comprised between 0.18 and 0.20, and IDI comprised between 0.30 
and 0.40.
CONCLUSION: RDW values significantly predicts long-term all-cause mortality in 
critically ill patients with severe sepsis beyond conventional severity scores.

BACKGROUND: The dysregulated stress response is a key pathological mechanism 
underlying sepsis and is strongly associated with poor clinical outcomes. Stress 
hyperglycemia, a common manifestation of this response, may provide valuable 
prognostic information in sepsis patients. The stress hyperglycemia ratio (SHR) 
offers a more accurate reflection of the stress response and may be instrumental 
in assessing sepsis prognosis.
METHODS: This study aimed to investigate the relationship between SHRs and 
clinical outcomes in sepsis patients. Data were obtained from the Medical 
Information Mart for Intensive Care IV database. Demographic information, 
intensive care unit (ICU) parameters within the first 24 h, laboratory results, 
insulin administration, survival time, and outcomes were extracted for analysis. 
Four SHR metrics (SHRfirst, SHRmin, SHRmax, and SHRmean) were calculated based 
on blood glucose values during the first 24 h of ICU admission (first, minimum, 
maximum, and mean, respectively). The predictive performance of each SHR metric 
was compared using the area under the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) 
curve. Kaplan-Meier survival analysis was performed to assess survival rates 
across groups defined by ROC curve-generated cut-off values. Associations 
between SHR and 28-day as well as 1-year mortality were further examined using 
both univariate and multivariate Cox regression analyses.
RESULTS: A total of 5,025 sepsis patients were included, of whom 656 died within 
28 days of ICU admission. SHR was significantly higher in the non-survivor 
group. Among the SHR metrics, SHRmax demonstrated the highest predictive value 
for both 28-day and 1-year mortality. Higher SHR values were consistently 
associated with increased mortality (all P < 0.001). For SHRmax, each 1-unit 
increase was associated with a 77% increase in mortality in univariate analysis 
and a 71.6% increase in multivariate analysis. Sensitivity analyses indicated 
that the relationship between SHR and mortality was stronger in patients without 
diabetes.
CONCLUSIONS: SHR serves as a robust marker of the dysregulated stress response 
in sepsis and holds significant prognostic value, particularly SHRmax, in 
predicting mortality. These findings underscore the potential clinical utility 
of SHR in guiding therapeutic strategies aimed at modulating the stress response 
and blood glucose levels in critically ill sepsis patients. Further research is 
warranted to explore SHR-targeted interventions in sepsis management.

OBJECTIVE: The short-term efficacy of red blood cell (RBC) transfusion among 
general traumatic brain injury (TBI) patients is unclear.
METHODS: We used the MIMIC database to compare the efficacy of liberal (10 g/dL) 
versus conservative (7 g/dL) transfusion strategy in TBI patients. The outcomes 
were neurological progression (decrease of Glasgow coma scale (GCS) of at least 
2 points) and death within 28 days of ICU admission. Each eligible individual 
was cloned and assigned each of the replicates to one of the treatment arm. The 
imbalance induced by informative censoring was adjusted by inverse probability 
weighting. The standardized, weighted pooled logistic regression with 500 
bootstrap resampling was used to estimate the cumulative risk difference and 95% 
confidence interval (CI).
RESULTS: Of the 1141 eligible individuals, 29.0% received RBC transfusion. 
Compared with the restrictive group, the liberal strategy reduced early death 
(3 days: 5%, 95% CI: 2%-7%; 7 days: 6%, 95% CI: 3%-11%); however, no significant 
difference of mortality risk at 28-day or neurological progression risk at any 
time points was observed. The risk of coagulopathy at 3 days was increased by 7% 
(95% CI: 1%-19%) in the liberal group. The subgroup analysis indicated a 
beneficial effect of liberal transfusion on mortality in hemodynamically 
unstable patients.
INTERPRETATION: Compared with the restrictive strategy, the liberal strategy 
does not improve the short-term neurological prognosis and death among patients 
with TBI in a real-world situation. The liberal strategy may be beneficial to 
survival at very early stage or in hemodynamically unstable subgroup.

OBJECTIVE: The relationship between body mass index (BMI) and sepsis prognosis 
remains highly controversial and uncertain. This study investigated the 
association between BMI and prognosis in patients with sepsis.
METHODS: This retrospective observational cohort study included adult patients 
admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) with sepsis from Medical Information 
Mart for Intensive Care-IV version 2.2 (MIMIC-IV V2.2) and eICU Collaborative 
Research Database (eICU-CRD). The cut-off value of BMI was identified by the 
restricted cubic spline (RCS) curve and included patients were categorized into 
two groups: the low BMI group (< 28 kg/m2) and the high BMI group (≥ 28 kg/m2). 
The primary outcome was ICU mortality, and secondary outcomes were in-hospital 
and 28-day mortality. We performed the log-rank test to detect whether there is 
a difference in prognosis among different groups in two different cohorts. 
Multiple distinct models were used to validate the robustness of the results.
RESULTS: There were 18,385 and 38,713 patients in the MIMIC-IV 2.2 and eICU-CRD 
cohorts, respectively. An L-shaped relationship was observed between BMI and ICU 
mortality in the primary analysis from MIMIC-IV 2.2. Similar relationships were 
found in eICU-CRD. When BMI was less than the cut-point, the risk of ICU 
mortality increased rapidly with decreasing BMI. When BMI was greater than the 
cut-point, the risk of ICU mortality levelled off as BMI increased. Sepsis 
patients with higher BMI values exhibited decreased ICU all-cause mortality 
rates (MIMIC-IV cohort: HR: 0.81, 95% CI 0.75-0.88, p < 0.001; eICU-CRD cohort: 
HR: 0.75, 95% CI 0.71-0.80, p < 0.001). Consistent trends were observed for both 
in-hospital mortality and 28-day mortality rates. The results remained robust in 
multiple distinct models and subgroup analyses.
CONCLUSION: An L-shaped relationship was observed between BMI and prognosis in 
septic patients, indicating that lower BMI values are significantly linked to 
increased mortality. Targeted nutritional interventions and close monitoring for 
patients with low BMI could potentially enhance their prognosis. Therefore, BMI 
can also be utilized to categorize the risk levels of patients with sepsis and 
effectively predict their prognosis.

Aiming at the problem that the small samples of critical disease in clinic may 
lead to prognostic models with poor performance of overfitting, large prediction 
error and instability, the long short-term memory transferring algorithm 
(transLSTM) was proposed. Based on the idea of transfer learning, the algorithm 
leverages the correlation between diseases to transfer information of different 
disease prognostic models, constructs the effictive model of target disease of 
small samples with the aid of large data of related diseases, hence improves the 
prediction performance and reduces the requirement for target training sample 
quantity. The transLSTM algorithm firstly uses the related disease samples to 
pretrain partial model parameters, and then further adjusts the whole network 
with the target training samples. The testing results on MIMIC-Ⅲ database showed 
that compared with traditional LSTM classification algorithm, the transLSTM 
algorithm had 0.02-0.07 higher AUROC and 0.05-0.14 larger AUPRC, while its 
number of training iterations was only 39%-64% of the traditional algorithm. The 
results of application on sepsis revealed that the transLSTM model of only 100 
training samples had comparable mortality prediction performance to the 
traditional model of 250 training samples. In small sample situations, the 
transLSTM algorithm has significant advantages with higher prediciton accuracy 
and faster training speed. It realizes the application of transfer learning in 
the prognostic model of critical disease with small samples.

针对临床上重症疾病样本数量少容易导致预后模型过拟合、预测误差大、不稳定的问题，本文提出迁移长短时程记忆算法（transLSTM）。该算法基于迁移学习思想，利用疾病间的相关性实现不同疾病预后模型的信息迁移，借助相关疾病的大数据辅助构建小样本目标病种有效模型，提升模型预测性能，降低对目标训练样本量的要求。transLSTM 
算法先利用相关疾病数据预训练部分模型参数，再用目标训练样本进一步调整整个网络。基于 MIMIC-Ⅲ数据库的测试结果显示，相比传统的 LSTM 
分类算法，transLSTM 算法的 AUROC 指标高出 0.02～0.07，AUPRC 指标超过 0.05～0.14，训练迭代次数仅为传统算法的 
39%～64%。应用于脓毒症疾病的结果显示，仅 100 个训练样本的 transLSTM 模型死亡率预测性能与 250 
个训练样本的传统模型相当。在小样本情况下，transLSTM 算法预测精度更高、训练速度更快，具有显著优势。它实现了迁移学习在小样本重症疾病预后模型中的应用。.

BACKGROUND: In critically ill elderly patients, malnutrition is a common 
comorbidity. The Geriatric Nutritional Risk Index (GNRI) is a straightforward 
tool for evaluating the nutritional status of elderly individuals. The 
association between GNRI score and unfavorable health outcomes has been 
established. However, no studies have yet elucidated the relationship between 
GNRI score and sepsis-related acute kidney injury (S-AKI).
METHODS: We sourced patient data from the Medical Information Mart for Intensive 
Care IV (MIMIC-IV) database. All patients were divided into four groups based on 
their GNRI score using quartile analysis. The main objective of this study was 
to investigate the 28-day mortality rate. Secondary study outcomes were the 
incidence of severe AKI, length of stay in the intensive care unit, and days in 
the hospital. To evaluate the association between GNRI score and study outcomes, 
we used a Cox proportional hazards regression model and restricted cubic 
splines. Kaplan-Meier curves were used to compare the outcomes in each group.
RESULTS: A total of 4515 elderly patients with S-AKI were included in this 
study. Patients were categorized into four groups according to GNRI quartile: Q1 
(< 78.92), Q2 (78.92-84.88), Q3 (84.88-90.84), and Q4 (> 90.84). Overall 28-day 
mortality was 29.5%. Patients with a low GNRI were predominantly women, and had 
a low body mass index. After controlling for confounding factors, GNRI score 
emerged as an independent predictor of 28-day mortality among elderly patients 
with S-AKI (Q4 vs. Q1: hazard ratio 0.74, 95% confidence interval 0.63-0.87; 
p < 0.001). Restricted cubic spline analysis revealed a linear relationship 
between GNRI and 28-day mortality (p for non-linearity = 0.207), and this 
association remained consistent across all subgroup analyses.
CONCLUSIONS: The GNRI is an important nutritional assessment tool, and is useful 
in predicting the prognosis of critically ill elderly patients with S- AKI.

INTRODUCTION: Hospital readmissions often result from a combination of factors, 
including inadequate follow-up care, poor discharge planning, patient 
non-adherence, and social determinants of health (SDOH) that impact access to 
healthcare and follow-up resources, many of which are beyond provider control. 
Enhanced post-discharge strategies, including risk stratification, are 
essential. This study aims to develop and validate the Discharge Severity Index 
(DSI) to predict readmission risk and optimize resource allocation for effective 
follow-up care.
METHODS: This single-center retrospective study analyzed ED visits from the 
Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care IV, dividing the data into 
derivation (75 %) and validation (25 %) cohorts. Univariate analyses were 
conducted on factors commonly available for most discharges, including patient 
age, the latest vital signs recorded, medical complexity, and ED length of stay 
(LOS). Multiple logistic regression (MLR) was employed to identify independent 
risk factors of patients revisiting the ED within a week and being subsequently 
admitted to the hospital. Adjusted parameter estimates from the MLR were used to 
develop a predictive model.
RESULTS: Among 229,920 patients discharged from the ED, 1.92 % were readmitted. 
The analysis identified seven variables correlated with this outcome, with six 
significant risk factors pinpointed through MLR: age above 65, heart rate over 
100, and oxygen saturation below 96 % (assigned 1 point each), along with having 
more than five active medications administered during the hospital stay or a LOS 
exceeding 3 h (assigned 2 points each). Using these scores, we categorized 
patients into five DSI groups, reflecting escalating readmission risk from DSI 5 
(lowest risk) to DSI 1 (highest risk): DSI 5 (0; OR: 1.0), DSI 4 (1-2; OR: 
3.49), DSI 3 (3-4; OR: 8.44), DSI 2 (5-6; OR: 11.65), and DSI 1 (>6; OR: 14.63). 
The seven-day readmission rates were comparable between the development and 
validation cohorts. For instance, for DSI 1, the rates were 5.16 % in the 
development cohort and 4.67 % in the validation cohort. For DSI 2, the rates 
were 4.16 % and 4.04 %, respectively.
CONCLUSION: This study seeks to develop and validate the DSI, proposing its 
effectiveness as a tool for healthcare providers to categorize patients by their 
risk of post-discharge admission from the ED. The utilization of this tool has 
the potential to lead to a more informed allocation of resources after 
discharge.

OBJECTIVES: The purpose of this study was to investigate the relationship 
between hematocrit levels and the mortality of patients with acute pancreatitis 
(AP), since limited research has examined this association in intensive care 
unit (ICU).
METHODS: In this study, clinical data were retrieved from Medical Information 
Mart for Intensive Care database for patients diagnosed with AP. Nonlinear 
relationships between hematocrit and prognosis were examined through Locally 
Estimated Scatterplot Smoothing (LOESS) regression, restricted cubic splines 
(RCS), and U-test analyses. The impact of hematocrit on prognosis was further 
explored using with a binomial generalized linear model with a logit link, while 
adjusting for potential confounding factors.
RESULTS: The study encompassed 1,914 patients with AP, revealing a significant 
difference in hematocrit levels between survivors and non-survivors (33.6 (29.5, 
38.1) vs. 32.1 (28.1, 37.4), P < 0.001). Hematocrit emerged as an independent 
prognostic indicator for mortality in both univariate and multivariate logistic 
regression analyses (all P < 0.05). Findings from LOESS regression, RCS 
regression, and the U-test indicated a U-shaped correlation between hematocrit 
levels and 28-day mortality, with both elevated and decreased hematocrit levels 
leading to increased mortality risk (P for overall < 0.001). Tertile grouping 
revealed that lower hematocrit levels (< 30.8%) were associated with heightened 
28-day mortality risk (Crude model: Odds ratio (OR) (95%Confidence Interval 
(CI)) = 1.665 (1.198-2.314); fully adjusted model: adjusted OR = 1.474 
(1.005-2.161), all P < 0.05). Survival analyses further supported the adverse 
prognosis associated with low hematocrit levels.
CONCLUSIONS: The findings of this study indicate that in AP patients in the 
intensive care unit, only low HCT levels were identified as a risk factor for 
28-day mortality, despite the presence of a U-shaped correlation between HCT 
levels and 28-day all-cause mortality.

Previous studies have indicated that a higher ventilatory ratio (VR) is 
associated with mortality. However, it is unknown whether dynamic changes in VR 
over time affect the prognosis of critically ill patients. This study aims to 
investigate the significance of VR during the progression of the disease in 
critically ill patients. The Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care III 
database was searched to identify critically ill patients. The primary outcome 
was 30-day mortality. Multivariable Cox regression was used to elucidate the 
relationship between the VR and mortality. Finally, we employed a generalized 
additive mixed model to compare trends in VR over time between survivors and 
non-survivors. A total of 8024 patients were enrolled. Multivariable Cox 
regression analysis identified a baseline VR ≥1.89 as an independent risk factor 
predicting 30-day mortality (hazard ratio: 2.10, 95% confidence interval: 
1.89-2.33, P < .001) and 90-day mortality (hazard ratio: 2.18, 95% confidence 
interval: 1.97-2.41, P < .001) after adjusting for potential confounders. In the 
subgroup analyses, the observed association between VR and 30-day mortality 
showed consistent direction across most subgroups. The generalized additive 
mixed model results highlighted that the difference in VR between survivors and 
non-survivors increased by an average of 0.01 per day after adjusting for 
several covariates. In conclusion, VR dynamically mirrors pathophysiological 
changes in critically ill patients and its escalation is linked to higher 
mortality rates. Monitoring VR's dynamic shifts might offer more immediate 
prognostic information, thus aiding in timely interventions and risk 
stratification.

BACKGROUND: Respiratory rate (RR) is one important vital sign that is often 
neglected in patients with acute myocardial infarction (AMI). The present study 
aimed to evaluate the impact of admission RR on the prognosis in patients with 
AMI.
METHODS: This study included 5631 AMI patients from Medical Information Mart for 
Intensive Care IV (MIMIC-IV) and 1323 patients from The First Affiliated 
Hospital of Chongqing Medical University (validation cohort). The primary 
endpoint was 30-day all-cause mortality. Patients were divided into increased RR 
group (RR > 20 breaths/min) and normal RR group (RR ≤ 20 breaths/min) based on 
admission RR.
RESULTS: In the MIMIC-IV cohort, the median age was 70 years and 3503 (62.2%) 
patients were male. Compared to patients with normal RR, patients with admission 
RR > 20 breaths/min had significantly increased risk of 30-day all-cause 
mortality (14.2% vs. 27.5%, p < 0.001). After multivariate adjustment, admission 
RR > 20 breaths/min was independently associated with increased risk of 30-day 
all-cause mortality (HR 1.715; 95%CI 1.507-1.952, p < 0.001). The findings from 
MIMIC-IV were validated in the data from The First Affiliated Hospital of 
Chongqing Medical University and the results were consistent.
CONCLUSION: RR is not only a vital sign but also a simple and practical 
indicator for predicting the prognosis of patients with AMI. Increased RR upon 
admission independently predicted a higher risk of poor outcomes, making it a 
valuable tool for early risk stratification and guiding timely interventions.

BACKGROUND: Predicting the prognosis of patients with acute myocardial 
infarction (AMI) combined with diabetes mellitus (DM) is crucial due to high 
in-hospital mortality rates. This study aims to develop and validate a mortality 
risk prediction model for these patients by interpretable machine learning (ML) 
methods.
METHODS: Data were sourced from the Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care 
IV (MIMIC-IV, version 2.2). Predictors were selected by Least absolute shrinkage 
and selection operator (LASSO) regression and checked for multicollinearity with 
Spearman's correlation. Patients were randomly assigned to training and 
validation sets in an 8:2 ratio. Seven ML algorithms were used to construct 
models in the training set. Model performance was evaluated in the validation 
set using metrics such as area under the curve (AUC) with 95% confidence 
interval (CI), calibration curves, precision, recall, F1 score, accuracy, 
negative predictive value (NPV), and positive predictive value (PPV). The 
significance of differences in predictive performance among models was assessed 
utilising the permutation test, and 10-fold cross-validation further validated 
the model's performance. SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) and Local 
Interpretable Model-agnostic Explanations (LIME) were applied to interpret the 
models.
RESULTS: The study included 2,828 patients with AMI combined with DM. Nineteen 
predictors were identified through LASSO regression and Spearman's correlation. 
The Random Forest (RF) model was demonstrated the best performance, with an AUC 
of 0.823 (95% CI: 0.774-0.872), high precision (0.867), accuracy (0.873), and 
PPV (0.867). The RF model showed significant differences (p < 0.05) compared to 
the K-Nearest Neighbours and Decision Tree models. Calibration curves indicated 
that the RF model's predicted risk aligned well with actual outcomes. 10-fold 
cross-validation confirmed the superior performance of RF model, with an average 
AUC of 0.828 (95% CI: 0.800-0.842). Significant Variables in RF model indicated 
that the top eight significant predictors were urine output, maximum anion gap, 
maximum urea nitrogen, age, minimum pH, maximum international normalised ratio 
(INR), mean respiratory rate, and mean systolic blood pressure.
CONCLUSION: This study demonstrates the potential of ML methods, particularly 
the RF model, in predicting in-hospital mortality risk for AMI patients with DM. 
The SHAP and LIME methods enhance the interpretability of ML models.

Sepsis is well known with high mortality, and there is a need for early 
recognition of septic patients with poor prognosis. The purpose of this study is 
to evaluate the association between lactate dehydrogenase to albumin ratio (LAR) 
and the short-term mortality in sepsis. Septic patients were selected from 
Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care IV database. The primary and 
secondary outcomes were 28-day and 90-day all-cause mortality. Cox regression 
analysis, Kaplan-Meier survival curves, restricted cubic spline and subgroup and 
sensitivity analyses were performed to explore the relationship between LAR and 
mortality. The study included 5784 patients with sepsis. Kaplan-Meier analysis 
showed that patients with higher LAR exhibited lower 28-day and 90-day survival 
rates. There existed a linear relationship between log2 transformed LAR and 
28-day and 90-day mortality. Multivariable Cox regression analysis revealed a 
positive relationship between log2-LAR and 28-day mortality risk (HR, 1.36; 95% 
CI, 1.29-1.42; P < .001). Patients in the second and third tertile groups had 
higher risk for 28-day mortality (HR = 1.46, 95% CI = 1.26-1.70, and HR = 2.14, 
95% CI = 1.85-2.49, respectively; P for trend < .001), compared to first tertile 
group. Similar results were found for 90-day mortality. Subgroup and sensitivity 
analyses revealed consistent results. High LAR was independently associated with 
an increased risk of 28-day and 90-day all-cause mortality in patients with 
sepsis. LAR was suggested to be a promising biomarker for early identification 
of septic patients at higher risk of short-term mortality.

Background: This study aimed to develop and validate a straightforward clinical 
risk model utilizing white blood cell (WBC) counts to predict acute kidney 
injury (AKI) in critically sick patients with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). 
Methods: Data were taken from the Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care-IV 
(MIMIC-IV) database for the training cohort. Data for an internal validation 
cohort were obtained from the eICU Collaborative Research Database (eICU-CRD), 
while patients from our hospital were utilized for external validation. A risk 
model was created utilizing significant indicators identified through 
multivariate logistic regression, following logistic regression analysis to 
determine the primary predictors of WBC-related biomarkers for AKI prediction. 
The Kaplan-Meier curve was employed to evaluate the prognostic efficacy of the 
new risk model. Results: A total of 1628 critically sick HCC patients were 
enrolled. Among these, 23 (23.2%) patients at our hospital, 84 (17.9%) patients 
in the eICU-CRD database, and 379 (35.8%) patients in the MIMIC-IV database 
developed AKI. A unique risk model was developed based on leukocyte-related 
indicators following the multivariate logistic regression analysis, 
incorporating white blood cell to neutrophil ratio (WNR), white blood cell to 
monocyte ratio (WMR), white blood cell to hemoglobin ratio (WHR), and platelet 
to lymphocyte ratio (PLR). This risk model exhibited robust predictive 
capability for AKI, in-hospital mortality, and ICU mortality across the training 
set, internal validation set, and external validation set. Conclusion: This risk 
model seems to have practical consequences as an innovative and accessible tool 
for forecasting the prognosis of critically ill HCC patients, which may, to some 
degree, aid in identifying equitable risk assessments and treatment strategies.

BACKGROUND: Nontraumatic subarachnoid hemorrhage (NSAH) is a type of hemorrhagic 
stroke with high mortality and low recovery rates. Although statins are commonly 
used in cardiovascular diseases, their impact on subarachnoid hemorrhage 
prognosis remains unclear. This study aimed to explore the relationship between 
statin use and short-term and long-term all-cause mortality in critically ill 
patients with NSAH.
METHODS: Data from the Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care IV database 
were used to categorize critically ill patients with NSAH into statin and 
nonstatin groups. A Cox proportional hazards model assessed the association 
between statin use and all-cause mortality. Subgroup analyses were conducted to 
examine the consistency of statin effects on mortality.
RESULTS: The study included 750 patients, with 43% male. One-month mortality was 
21%, and intensive care unit mortality was 17%. Cox regression analysis showed 
that statin use was independently associated with reduced intensive care unit 
mortality (hazard ratio [HR = 0.52; P = 0.010), 1-month mortality (HR = 0.49; P 
< 0.001), 3-month mortality (HR = 0.62; P = 0.012), and 1-year mortality (HR = 
0.70; P = 0.040). Subgroup analyses showed no significant interactions. 
Simvastatin and atorvastatin both significantly reduced 1-month mortality.
CONCLUSIONS: Statin use may improve mortality outcomes in critically ill 
patients with NSAH, suggesting their potential benefit in this population.

OBJECTIVE: Heart failure (HF) is a chronic progressive syndrome caused by a 
variety of cardiovascular diseases and is associated with high morbidity, 
mortality, and healthcare burden. Forecasting the prognosis of HF patients at an 
early stage is important. Therefore, our objective was to explore the 
relationship between HF patients' prognosis and the albumin-bilirubin (ALBI) 
grade.
METHODS: Data for the study were obtained from the MIMIC database. Patients with 
ALBI grade 1 were matched to patients with ALBI grades 2 and 3 using propensity 
score matching (PSM). Post-matching analyses were performed using Cox 
proportional hazards models, Kaplan-Meier survival analysis, restricted cubic 
splines (RCS), and subgroup analyses.
RESULTS: RCS analyses revealed a nonlinear relationship between ALBI grade and 
30-, 90-, and 360-day mortality in patients with HF, with a threshold value 
identified at -1.92. When ALBI scores were below - 1.92, the risk of mortality 
in HF patients remained relatively stable. In contrast, as ALBI scores 
approached and exceeded - 1.92, the mortality risk increased rapidly. Before 
PSM, both ALBI grades 2 and 3 were independent predictors of mortality in 
patients with HF; however, after PSM, ALBI grade 2 was not statistically 
associated with patient mortality. This result was supported by Kaplan-Meier 
(K-M) analysis.

BACKGROUND: Acute myocardial infarction (AMI) has a significant impact on global 
health, especially among individuals with diabetes, emphasizing the need for 
specialized glycemic management. This study examines the glycemic comparison 
index (GCI), a novel prognostic tool designed for patients with AMI and 
diabetes, aiming to enhance glucose management in critical care settings.
METHODS: This retrospective cohort analysis used data from the Medical 
Information Mart for Intensive Care IV database (version 2.2). The GCI was 
calculated by comparing mean blood glucose levels in the intensive care unit 
(ICU) to baseline glucose levels. Patients were stratified into tertiles based 
on their GCI scores. The primary outcome measured was one-year all-cause 
mortality, while secondary outcomes included hospital mortality, ICU-free days, 
and hypoglycemic events. Statistical analyses included time-dependent receiver 
operating characteristic (ROC), cox proportional hazards models, generalized 
linear models (GLM), and restricted cubic spline analysis.
RESULTS: The patient population comprised 622 individuals, with a mean age of 
69.9 years and 64.6% male representation. The high GCI group exhibited the 
highest one-year mortality rate and fewer ICU-free days, while the low GCI group 
exhibited a higher incidence of hypoglycemia. Statistical analyses revealed that 
GCI was a significant predictor of one-year all-cause mortality (hazard ratio: 
2.21, 95% confidence interval: 1.51-3.24). Analysis using time-dependent ROC 
confirmed the consistent predictive accuracy of GCI for survival at 1, 6, and 
12 months (area under the curve: 0.671, 0.670, and 0.634, respectively). 
Furthermore, GLM analysis indicated that a higher GCI was associated with fewer 
ICU-free days.
CONCLUSIONS: Higher GCI values are associated with increased one-year mortality 
and fewer ICU-free days in patients with AMI and diabetes. In comparison, lower 
GCI values are correlated with a higher risk of hypoglycemia. The GCI 
demonstrates potential as a personalized prognostic tool, although further 
validation is needed.

BACKGROUND: Sepsis-associated encephalopathy (SAE) is a complex condition with 
variable outcomes. This study investigates the potential of the 
Triglyceride-glucose (TyG) index as a marker for disease severity and prognosis 
in SAE patients.
METHODS: We conducted a retrospective cohort study using data from the Medical 
Information Mart for Intensive Care (MIMIC-IV) database. Patients with sepsis 
who were admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) were categorized into two 
groups based on the occurrence of SAE. Key clinical outcomes were 90-day 
survival (primary outcome) and length of ICU and hospital stays, as well as the 
use of vasoactive medications (secondary outcomes). The TyG index was 
calculated, and its association with disease severity scores and patient 
outcomes was analyzed using statistical methods, including survival analysis, 
Cox regression, and correlation analyses.
RESULTS: The study population's median age was 65.96 years, predominantly male 
(60.1%). Higher TyG index scores correlated with elevated clinical severity 
scores (APSIII, LODS, OASIS, SAPSII, and CCI) and increased ICU and hospital 
stay durations. TyG index categorization revealed significant differences in 
90-day survival probabilities, with "high TyG" associated with a 25% increased 
mortality risk compared to "low TyG." Furthermore, TyG index showed a moderate 
positive correlation with ICU stay duration and use of norepinephrine and 
vasopressin, but not with dopamine and epinephrine use.
CONCLUSION: The TyG index is a significant independent predictor of disease 
severity and prognosis in SAE patients. High TyG levels correlate with worse 
clinical outcomes and increased mortality risk, suggesting its potential as a 
valuable tool in managing SAE.

Prostate cancer is the second most diagnosed cancer in the world. Treatment 
guidelines involve a multitude of therapies, however adherence to them is not 
fully established, while lack of personalized treatment strategies fails to put 
the patient as an individual clinical profile at the center of their treatment. 
We aim to present the concept of a digital treatment analyzer (TA) for the 
management of prostate cancer (PC) patients, leveraging real-world data (RWD) 
and predictive modeling to enhance personalized disease management strategies 
and adherence to PC guidelines, ultimately aiming to optimize therapeutic 
efficacy and improve outcomes. The TA comprises digital tools integrated into 
one user-intuitive interface, facilitating the development of patient-specific 
clinical profiles, classification of patients into matched historical RWD 
cohorts, presentation of relevant clinical guidelines, visual representation of 
treatment and outcomes, and mortality risk prediction based on a validated 
machine learning models. The Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care (MIMIC) 
IV dataset was utilized, including structured and unstructured data from the 
patient journey. The developed TA represents a promising approach to enhance 
personalized disease management strategies and adherence to PC guidelines. By 
integrating contemporary clinical guidelines, RWD and AI-driven insights, our 
digital TA aims to optimize therapeutic efficacy and improve patient outcomes. 
The presented concept demonstrates the potential for using a digital approach 
that integrates RWD into a treatment journey, to provide healthcare stakeholders 
with a holistic approach to PC management involving all available modern tools 
to achieve optimal outcomes.

OBJECTIVE: To construct an in-hospital mortality prediction model for patients 
with acute kidney injury (AKI) in intensive care unit (ICU) by using support 
vector machine (SVM), and compare it with the simplified acute physiology score 
II (SAPS-II) which is commonly used in the ICU.
METHODS: We used Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care III (MIMIC-III) 
database as data source. The AKI patients in the MIMIC-III database were 
selected according to the 2012 Kidney Disease: Improving Global Outcomes (KDIGO) 
definition of AKI. We employed the same predictor variable set as used in 
SAPS-II to construct an SVM model. Meanwhile, we also developed a customized 
SAPS-II model using MIMIC-III database, and compared performances between the 
SVM model and the customized SAPS-II model. The performance of each model was 
evaluated via area under the receiver operation characteristic curve (AUROC), 
root mean squared error (RMSE), sensitivity, specificity, Youden's index and 
accuracy based on 5-fold cross-validation. The agreement of the results between 
the SVM model and the customized SAPS-II model was illustrated using 
Bland-Altman plots.
RESULTS: A total number of 19 044 patients with AKI were included. The observed 
in-hospital mortality of the AKI patients was 13.58% in MIMIC-III. The results 
based on the 5-fold cross validation showed that the average AUROC of the SVM 
model and the customized SAPS-II model was 0.86 and 0.81, respectively (The 
difference between the two models was statistically significant with t=13.0, 
P<0.001). The average RMSE of the SVM model and the customized SAPS-II model was 
0.29 and 0.31, respectively (The difference was statistically significant with 
t=-9.6, P<0.001). The SVM model also outperformed the customized SAPS-II model 
in terms of sensitivity and Youden's index with significant statistical 
differences (P=0.002 and <0.001, respectively).The Bland-Altman plot showed that 
the SVM model and the customized SAPS-II model had similar mortality prediction 
results when the mortality of a patient was certain, but the consistency between 
the mortality prediction results of the two models was poor when the mortality 
of a patient was with high uncertainty.
CONCLUSION: Compared with the SAPS-II model, the SVM model has a better 
performance, especially when the mortality of a patient is with high 
uncertainty. The SVM model is more suitable for predicting the mortality of 
patients with AKI in ICU and early intervention in patients with AKI in ICU. The 
SVM model can effectively help ICU clinicians improve the quality of medical 
treatment, which has high clinical value.

BACKGROUND: Propofol and midazolam are commonly used sedative drugs in 
mechanically ventilated patients in the Intensive Care Unit (ICU). However, 
there is still a lack of relevant studies exploring the influence of midazolam 
and propofol on the prognosis of patients with Sepsis-associated Acute Kidney 
Injury (S-AKI).
PATIENTS AND METHODS: A statistical analysis was conducted on 3,745 patients 
with S-AKI in the Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care IV database. The 
patients' baseline characteristics were grouped based on the use of either 
propofol or midazolam as sedatives. Cox proportional hazards models, logistic 
regression models, and subgroup analyses were used to compare the effects of 
propofol and midazolam on the short-term prognosis of S-AKI patients, including 
30-day mortality, ICU mortality, and duration of mechanical ventilation.
RESULTS: In the statistical analysis, a total of 3,745 patients were included, 
with 649 patients using midazolam and 3,096 patients using propofol. In terms of 
the 30-day mortality, compared to patients using midazolam, S-AKI patients using 
propofol had a lower ICU mortality (hazard ratio = 0.62, 95% confidence 
interval: 0.52-0.74, p < 0.001), lower 30-day mortality (hazard ratio = 0.56, 
95% confidence interval: 0.47-0.67, p < 0.001), and shorter mechanical 
ventilation time (odds ratio = 0.72, 95% confidence interval: 0.59-0.88, 
p < 0.001). Kaplan-Meier curves showed lower survival probabilities in the 
midazolam group (p < 0.001). Subgroup analyses showed that propofol was strongly 
protective of short-term prognosis in older, male, smaller SOFA score CCI score, 
no heart failure, and comorbid chronic kidney disease patients with S-AKI.
CONCLUSION: Compared to midazolam, propofol was considered a protective factor 
for short-term mortality risk and ICU mortality risk in S-AKI patients. 
Additionally, S-AKI patients using propofol had a lower risk of requiring 
prolonged mechanical ventilation. Overall, propofol may be more beneficial for 
the short-term prognosis of S-AKI patients compared to midazolam.

AIM: The aim of this study was to examine the utility of liver function tests 
(LFTs) in predicting the prognosis of critically ill patients with primary 
pulmonary hypertension (PPH) with/without liver disease.
METHODS: We retrieved the Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care III 
(MIMIC-III) database to acquire clinical data. From the database, we recruited 
adult patients that were equal to or older than 18 years with primary pulmonary 
hypertension (PPH) discharge from intensive care unit (ICU). Then, the 
relationship between LFTs and duration of hospitalization and ICU stays was 
examined based on the Spearman correlation. The chi-square assessment was 
conducted to examine the correlation between LFTs and death rates. Survival 
curves were plotted with the aid of the Kaplan-Meier technique, and the curves 
were subsequently compared utilizing the log-rank test. The LFTs were identified 
as independent predictive variables of death according to the results of 
multivariable logistic regression. The specificity and sensitivity for mortality 
were calculated utilizing receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves and the 
area under the curve (AUC).
RESULTS: In total, 198 patients satisfying the inclusion criteria were 
recruited, among which there were 23 patients with liver disease. Only ALB was 
correlated with the length of ICU stay in the total PPH group. ALB independently 
served as a risk variable for hospital mortality and 90-day mortality and was 
significantly associated with 90-day and 4-year survival rates in both total PPH 
and PPH without liver disease. AST was correlated with hospital mortality and 
90-day survival curves in both total PPH and PPH without liver disease and 
independently served as a risk factor for hospital and 90-day mortality only in 
the total PPH group. ALT independently acted as a risk variable for hospital 
mortality and total bilirubin was correlated with hospital mortality in the 
total group. The diagnostic performance of the predictive model combining the 
LFTs was moderately good for the hospital, 90-day, and 4-year mortality. Both 
Modelı End-Stage ıLiverı Disease (MELD) score and albumin-bilirubin (ALBI) score 
were independent risk factors for short- and long-term prognosis. And they were 
also significantly associated with short- and long-term prognosis.
CONCLUSION: Among critically ill patients with PPH and with or without liver 
illness, aberrant LFT was linked to short- and long-term prognoses.

BACKGROUND: The prediction of successful weaning from mechanical ventilation 
(MV) in advance of intubation can facilitate discussions regarding end-of-life 
care before unnecessary intubation.
OBJECTIVE: We aimed to develop a machine learning-based model that predicts 
successful weaning from ventilator support based on routine clinical and 
laboratory data taken before or immediately after intubation.
METHODS: We used the Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care IV database, 
which is an open-access database covering 524,740 admissions of 382,278 patients 
in Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center, United States, from 2008 to 2019. We 
selected adult patients who underwent MV in the intensive care unit (ICU). 
Clinical and laboratory variables that are considered relevant to the prognosis 
of the patient in the ICU were selected. Data collected before or within 24 
hours of intubation were used to develop machine learning models that predict 
the probability of successful weaning within 14 days of ventilator support. 
Developed models were integrated into an ensemble model. Performance metrics 
were calculated by 5-fold cross-validation for each model, and a permutation 
feature importance and Shapley additive explanations analysis was conducted to 
better understand the impacts of individual variables on outcome prediction.
RESULTS: Of the 23,242 patients, 19,025 (81.9%) patients were successfully 
weaned from MV within 14 days. Using the preselected 46 clinical and laboratory 
variables, the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve of 
CatBoost classifier, random forest classifier, and regularized logistic 
regression classifier models were 0.860 (95% CI 0.852-0.868), 0.855 (95% CI 
0.848-0.863), and 0.823 (95% CI 0.813-0.832), respectively. Using the ensemble 
voting classifier using the 3 models above, the final model revealed the area 
under the receiver operating characteristic curve of 0.861 (95% CI 0.853-0.869), 
which was significantly better than that of Simplified Acute Physiology Score II 
(0.749, 95% CI 0.742-0.756) and Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (0.588, 95% 
CI 0.566-0.609). The top features included lactate and anion gap. The model's 
performance achieved a plateau with approximately the top 21 variables.
CONCLUSIONS: We developed machine learning algorithms that can predict 
successful weaning from MV in advance to intubation in the ICU. Our models can 
aid the appropriate management for patients who hesitate to decide on ventilator 
support or meaningless end-of-life care.

BACKGROUND: Acute kidney injury (AKI) is a common complication in critically ill 
patients with sepsis and is often associated with a poor prognosis. We aimed to 
construct and validate an interpretable prognostic prediction model for patients 
with sepsis-associated AKI (S-AKI) using machine learning (ML) methods.
METHODS: Data on the training cohort were collected from the Medical Information 
Mart for Intensive Care IV database version 2.2 to build the model, and data of 
patients were extracted from Hangzhou First People's Hospital Affiliated to 
Zhejiang University School of Medicine for external validation of model. 
Predictors of mortality were identified using Recursive Feature Elimination 
(RFE). Then, random forest, extreme gradient boosting (XGBoost), multilayer 
perceptron classifier, support vector classifier, and logistic regression were 
used to establish a prognosis prediction model for 7, 14, and 28 days after 
intensive care unit (ICU) admission, respectively. Prediction performance was 
assessed using the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve and decision 
curve analysis (DCA). SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) were used to 
interpret the ML models.
RESULTS: In total, 2599 patients with S-AKI were included in the analysis. Forty 
variables were selected for the model development. According to the areas under 
the ROC curve (AUC) and DCA results for the training cohort, XGBoost model 
exhibited excellent performance with F1 Score of 0.847, 0.715, 0.765 and AUC 
(95% CI) of 0.91 (0.90, 0.92), 0.78 (0.76, 0.80), and 0.83 (0.81, 0.85) in 
7 days, 14 days and 28 days group, respectively. It also demonstrated excellent 
discrimination in the external validation cohort. Its AUC (95% CI) was 0.81 
(0.79, 0.83), 0.75 (0.73, 0.77), 0.79 (0.77, 0.81) in 7 days, 14 days and 
28 days group, respectively. SHAP-based summary plot and force plot were used to 
interpret the XGBoost model globally and locally.
CONCLUSIONS: ML is a reliable tool for predicting the prognosis of patients with 
S-AKI. SHAP methods were used to explain intrinsic information of the XGBoost 
model, which may prove clinically useful and help clinicians tailor precise 
management.

BACKGROUND: Sepsis is a systemic inflammatory response syndrome with high 
mortality. There is an upward trend in sepsis prevalence and mortality 
worldwide. Early and accurate prediction of outcome in sepsis is important. 
There remains a great need to improve a reliable prognostic model for sepsis 
patients with widely available variables. The aim of this study was to explore 
the correlation between serum thyroid hormone levels and prognosis in sepsis 
patients.
METHODS: Septic patients were identified from the Medical Information Mart for 
Intensive Care (MIMIC)-III database. Factors that were found to contribute to 
the outcome in the uni-variate analysis at P value <0.1 were included in the 
multivariate. Multivariate analysis was performed by binary logistic regression 
analysis, which allows adjust for confounding factors. We combined an assessment 
of thyroid hormone and some variables together, which improve the accurate 
prediction of outcome. The accuracy of the test was assessed measuring the area 
under the ROC curve (AUROC).
RESULTS: A total of 929 eligible septic patients were included in the data 
analysis. Seventy hundred and three patients had a good functional outcome, 
whereas 226 patients had a bad functional outcome. Thyroxin (T4) level was 
significantly decreased in patients with an unfavorable functional outcome as 
compared to patients with a favorable functional outcome (P < 0.01). Binary 
logistic regression analyses revealed that lower thyroxin concentrations on 
admission were associated with a risk for poor outcomes (OR 0.556, 95% CI 
0.41-0.75; P < 0.01). In addition, in ROC curve analysis, the combined model 
AUROC was 0.82 for ICU survival, which was significantly higher than the AUROCs 
of original fT4 (0.65 and 0.65), T4 (0.71 and 0.71) and SAPSII (0.70 and 0.72) 
(all P < 0.05).
CONCLUSIONS: Low serum thyroxin levels can be a predictive marker of short-term 
outcome after sepsis. A combined model (fT4, T4 and SAPSII score) can add 
significant additional predictive information to the clinical score of the 
SAPSII.

BACKGROUND: The rapid assessment of the conditions is crucial for the prognosis 
of atrial fibrillation (AF) patients admitted to the emergency department (ED). 
We aim to derive and validate a more accurate and simplified scoring model to 
optimize the triage of AF patients in the ED.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: We conducted a retrospective study using data from the 
Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care (MIMIC-IV) database and developed 
scoring models employing the Random Forest algorithm. The area under the 
receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve (AUC) was used to measure the 
performance of the prediction for intensive care unit (ICU) stay, and the death 
likelihood within 3, 7, and 30 days following the ED admission.
RESULTS: The study included 30 366 AF patients, randomly divided into training, 
validation, and testing cohorts at a 7:1:2 ratio. The training set consisted of 
21 257 patients, the validation set included 3036 patients, and the remaining 
6073 patients were classified as the validation set. Among the cohorts, 9594 
patients (32%) required ICU transfers, with mortality rates of 1% at 3 days, 3% 
at 7 days, and 6% at 30 days. In the testing set, the scoring models 
demonstrated strong discriminative ability with AUCs of 0.724 for ICU stay, 
0.782 for 3-day mortality, 0.755 for 7-day mortality, and 0.767 for 30-day 
mortality.
CONCLUSION: We derived and validated novel simplified scoring models with good 
discriminative performance to predict the likelihood of ICU stay, 3-day, 7-day, 
and 30-day death in AF patients after ED admission.

BACKGROUND: It is well known that thrombocytopenia occurs in patients with 
traumatic brain injury (TBI), and its incidence increases with the severity of 
injury. We aimed to determine whether postoperative thrombocytopenia in patients 
with TBI is associated with poor clinical outcomes.
METHODS: This was a retrospective cohort study of a large international database 
called the Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care III (MIMIC-III), which 
included 1093 patients who underwent TBI surgery. Hospital mortality was the 
primary endpoint of this study.
RESULTS: Multivariate logistic regression analysis revealed non-thrombocytopenia 
was significantly associated with a decreased hospital mortality (adjusted odds 
ratio [OR] 0.49; 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.33-0.75; p = .01). In addition, 
platelet counts increased over time in both survivors and non-survivors, 
according to generalized additive mixed model (GAMM). However, the platelet 
count increased more noticeably in the survivors than in the non-survivors and 
the difference in platelet count between the two groups showed a trend toward 
increasing within 7 days after surgery. This difference increased by 7.97 per 
day on average.
CONCLUSIONS: Patients with TBI who experienced postoperative thrombocytopenia 
were more likely to have a poor short-term prognosis. In addition, we found that 
the rate of platelet growth over time varied significantly between the survival 
and non-survival groups. Patients with TBI who experienced a greater early 
increase in platelet count had a lower mortality rate.

OBJECTIVE: Patients with traumatic brain injury (TBI) who are admitted to the 
intensive care unit often exhibit critical conditions; thus, early prediction of 
in-hospital mortality is crucial. In this study, we aimed to develop a reliable 
and easily promotable model for predicting the in-hospital mortality of 
critically ill patients with TBI using easily accessible indicators and validate 
the model using external data.
METHODS: Patient data from the Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care-IV 
2.2 database were used as training and internal validation sets to establish and 
internally validate the prognostic model. Data from the Affiliated Dongyang 
Hospital of Wenzhou Medical University were used for external validation. The 
Boruta algorithm was used for the initial feature selection, followed by 
univariate and multivariate logistic regression analyses to identify the final 
independent predictors. The predictive performance was evaluated using a 
receiver operating characteristic curve, calibration curve, clinical 
practicality decision curve analysis, and clinical impact curve.
RESULTS: This study included 3225 patients (training set: 2042; internal 
validation set: 874; and external validation set: 309). Ten variables were 
selected for inclusion in the nomogram model: age, mechanical ventilation usage, 
vasoactive agent usage, intracerebral hemorrhage, temperature, respiration rate, 
white blood cell count, platelet count, red blood cell distribution width, and 
glucose. The nomogram demonstrated good predictive performance in both the 
internal and external validation sets.
INTERPRETATION: We developed an externally validated nomogram that exhibited 
good discrimination, calibration, and clinical utility for predicting 
in-hospital mortality in critically ill patients with TBI.

BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: Patients with both coronary artery disease (CAD) and 
atrial fibrillation (AF) are at a high risk of major adverse cardiovascular and 
cerebrovascular events (MACCE) during hospitalization. Accurate prediction of 
MACCE can help identify high-risk patients and guide treatment decisions. This 
study was to elaborate and validate a dynamic nomogram for predicting the 
occurrence of MACCE during hospitalization in Patients with CAD combined with 
AF.
METHODS: A total of 3550 patients with AF and CAD were collected. They were 
randomly assigned to a training group and a validation group in a ratio of 
7 : 3. Univariate and multivariate analyses were utilized to identify risk 
factors ( P  < 0.05). To avoid multicollinearity and overfit of the model, the 
least absolute shrinkage and selection operator was conducted to further screen 
the risk factors. Calibration curves, receiver operating characteristic curves, 
and decision curve analyses are employed to assess the nomogram. For external 
validation, a cohort consisting of 249 patients was utilized from the Medical 
Information Mart for Intensive Care IV Clinical Database, version 2.2.
RESULTS: Eight indicators with statistical differences were screened by 
univariate analysis, multivariate analysis, and the least absolute shrinkage and 
selection operator method ( P  < 0.05). The prediction model based on eight risk 
factors demonstrated good prediction performance in the training group, with an 
area under the curve (AUC) of 0.838. This performance was also maintained in the 
internal validation group (AUC = 0.835) and the external validation group 
(AUC = 0.806). Meanwhile, the calibration curve indicates that the nomogram was 
well-calibrated, and decision curve analysis revealed that the nomogram 
exhibited good clinical utility.
CONCLUSION: The nomogram we constructed may aid in stratifying the risk and 
predicting the prognosis for patients with CAD and AF.

OBJECTIVE: To clarify the prognosis effect between body surface area (BSA) and 
patients with acute kidney injury (AKI), we attempted to analyze the association 
between BSA and 90-day all-cause mortality in critically ill patients with AKI.
METHODS: Clinical data of 9195 critically ill patients with AKI were retrieved 
from the Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care III database were then 
retrospectively analyzed. BSA were calculated using the Mosteller formula. We 
analyzed the correlation between BSA and 90-day all-cause mortality in 
critically ill patients with AKI based on Kaplan-Meier curve analysis and 
adjusted Cox regression model.
RESULTS: Of the 9195 critically ill patients with AKI, there were 3778 (41.1%) 
female patients and 2001 90-day all-cause deaths (female: 22.2%, male: 21.5%). 
Kaplan-Meier curve analysis revealed that a lower body surface area indicated a 
higher 90-day all-cause mortality in both male and female patients with AKI 
(log-rank P < 0.001). Cox regression model showed that a higher BSA was 
independently correlated with a lower 90-day all-cause mortality (female: hazard 
ratio=0.657, 95% confidence interval: 0.550-0.784, P < 0.001; male: hazard 
ratio=0.655, 95% confidence interval: 0.565-0.760, P < 0.001).
CONCLUSIONS: BSA was negatively correlated with 90-day all-cause mortality in 
critically ill patients with AKI. BSA can therefore be used as a prognostic 
indicator for poor outcomes in critically ill patients with AKI.

Background: This study aimed to investigate the association between 
triglyceride-glucose (TyG) index and prognosis in critically ill patients with 
acute coronary syndrome (ACS), exploring potential heterogeneity of the 
association among patient subgroups with different characteristics. Methods: 
Records of patients with ACS were extracted from the MIMIC-IV database. The 
association between TyG index and mortality was analyzed using Cox 
proportional-hazard regression model, while potential non-linear associations 
were assessed using restricted cubic spline (RCS) regression. Meanwhile, linear 
regression model was used to explore the association between TyG index and 
length of stay in hospital or ICU. Subpopulation Treatment Effect Pattern Plot 
(STEPP) was utilized to explore the potential heterogeneous subgroups. 
Time-dependent Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) curve analyses were 
performed to compare the predictive ability of different Cox proportional-hazard 
regression models (with or without TyG index). Results: A total of 849 patients 
were enrolled. Multivariate Cox regression analyses demonstrated that TyG index 
was significantly associated with 28-day mortality (HR:2.13 [95%CI: 1.23-3.68], 
P<0.01) and 365-day mortality (HR:1.65 [95%CI: 1.11-2.47], P<0.01). RCS 
regression analyses revealed an inverted U-shaped association between TyG index 
and 28-day mortality (P for non-linearity=0.027) and a linear association 
between TyG index and 365-day mortality (P for non-linearity =0.086). There were 
subgroups specified by age for 28-day mortality (P for interaction=0.04) and 
365-day mortality (P for interaction<0.01), with a cut-off point of 70 years old 
obtained by STEPP. TyG index was associated with a higher risk of mortality in 
subgroups aged ≤ 70 years old. Time-dependent ROC curve suggested that TyG index 
could slightly improve the prediction of mortality. A higher TyG index was 
associated with longer time of stay in hospital (β: 1.79 [95%CI: 0.06-3.52], 
P=0.04). Conclusions: A higher TyG index is associated with both short-term and 
long-term all-cause mortality in critically ill patients with ACS, especially in 
short-term all-cause mortality. TyG index is associated with higher mortality 
risk in patient subgroups aged ≤ 70 years old. A higher TyG index is associated 
with longer time of stay in hospital. TyG index may serve as a useful prognostic 
marker for patient management and strategic decision-making in clinical 
settings.

BACKGROUND: Sepsis-induced coagulopathy (SIC) is a severe complication of 
sepsis, characterized by poor prognosis and high mortality. However, the 
predictive factors for the development of SIC in sepsis patients remain to be 
determined. The aim of this study was to develop an easy-to-use and efficient 
nomogram for predicting the risk of sepsis patients developing SIC in the 
intensive care unit (ICU), based on common indicators and complications observed 
at admission.
METHODS: A total of 12, 455 sepsis patients from the MIMIC database were 
screened and randomly divided into training and validation cohorts. In the 
training cohort, LASSO regression was used for variable selection and 
regularization. The selected variables were then incorporated into a 
multivariable logistic regression model to construct the nomogram for predicting 
the risk of sepsis patients developing sepsis-induced coagulopathy (SIC). The 
model's predictive performance was evaluated using the area under the receiver 
operating characteristic curve (AUC), and its calibration was assessed through a 
calibration curve. Additionally, decision curve analysis (DCA) was performed to 
evaluate the clinical applicability of the model. External validation was 
conducted using data from the ICU database of Xingtai People's Hospital.
RESULTS: Among the 12, 455 sepsis patients, 5, 145 (41. 3%) developed SIC. The 
occurrence of SIC was significantly associated with the SOFA score, red blood 
cell count, red cell distribution width (RDW), white blood cell count, platelet 
count, INR, and lactate levels. Additionally, hypertension was identified as a 
potential protective factor. A nomogram was developed to predict the risk of 
SIC, which showed an AUC of 0. 81 (95% CI: 0. 79-0. 83) in the training set, 0. 
83 (95% CI: 0. 82-0. 84) in the validation set, and 0. 79 (95% CI: 0. 74-0. 84) 
in the external validation. The calibration curve of the nomogram showed good 
consistency between the observed and predicted probabilities of SIC.
CONCLUSIONS: The novel nomogram demonstrates excellent predictive performance 
for the incidence of SIC in ICU patients with sepsis and holds promise for 
assisting clinicians in early identification and intervention of SIC.

BACKGROUND: Mild traumatic brain injury (mTBI) comprises a majority of traumatic 
brain injury (TBI) cases. While some mTBI would suffer neurological 
deterioration (ND) and therefore have poorer prognosis. This study was designed 
to develop the predictive model for the ND among mTBI using machine learning 
algorithms.
METHODS: mTBI patients recorded in the Medical Information Mart for Intensive 
Care-III were selected for the study. The ND was defined as a drop of Glasgow 
Coma Scale ≥ 2 within the first 7 day after admission. Eight machine learning 
algorithms were trained and validated with 5-fold cross validation including 
extreme gradient boosting, logistic regression, light gradient boosting machine, 
random forest, adaptive boosting, decision tree, complement naïve Bayes, and 
support vector machine. The value of eight machine learning algorithms was 
compared by the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC).
RESULTS: 361 mTBI patients suffered the ND with the incidence of 30.7%. The ND 
group had higher 30-day mortality (p = 0.001). In the training cohort of mTBI 
patients, the random forest performed the best on predicting the ND with the AUC 
of 1.000. The XGBoost and AdaBoost had an AUC of 0.827 and 0.815, respectively. 
The logistic regression performed the best on predicting the ND in the 
validation cohort with the AUC of 0.741. The XGBoost, random forest and AdaBoost 
had an AUC of 0.729, 0.735, 0.736 in the validation cohort, respectively. After 
adjusting confounding effects, the multivariate logistic regression found only 
two independent risk factors for the ND including Sequential Organ Failure 
Assessment (SOFA) (p < 0.001) and hypertension (p = 0.001). The logistic 
regression predictive model composed of SOFA and hypertension had an AUC of 
0.741.
CONCLUSIONS: SOFA score and complicated hypertension are two independent risk 
factors for the neurological deterioration among mTBI patients. The logistic 
regression predictive model incorporating SOFA and hypertension is helpful to 
identify mTBI patients with the high risk of ND.

BACKGROUND: Medical concepts are inherently ambiguous and error-prone due to 
human fallibility, which makes it hard for them to be fully used by classical 
machine learning methods (eg, for tasks like early stage disease prediction).
OBJECTIVE: Our work was to create a new machine-friendly representation that 
resembles the semantics of medical concepts. We then developed a sequential 
predictive model for medical events based on this new representation.
METHODS: We developed novel contextual embedding techniques to combine different 
medical events (eg, diagnoses, prescriptions, and labs tests). Each medical 
event is converted into a numerical vector that resembles its "semantics," via 
which the similarity between medical events can be easily measured. We developed 
simple and effective predictive models based on these vectors to predict novel 
diagnoses.
RESULTS: We evaluated our sequential prediction model (and standard learning 
methods) in estimating the risk of potential diseases based on our contextual 
embedding representation. Our model achieved an area under the receiver 
operating characteristic (ROC) curve (AUC) of 0.79 on chronic systolic heart 
failure and an average AUC of 0.67 (over the 80 most common diagnoses) using the 
Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care III (MIMIC-III) dataset.
CONCLUSIONS: We propose a general early prognosis predictor for 80 different 
diagnoses. Our method computes numeric representation for each medical event to 
uncover the potential meaning of those events. Our results demonstrate the 
efficiency of the proposed method, which will benefit patients and physicians by 
offering more accurate diagnosis.

PURPOSE: We aimed to explore whether red blood cell distribution width (RDW) 
could serve as a biomarker to predict outcomes in critically ill patients with 
kidney failure in this study.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: This retrospective study was conducted with the Medical 
Information Mart for Intensive Care IV (MIMIC-IV).A total of 674 patients were 
divided into three groups based on tertiles of RDW. We used the generalized 
additive model, Kaplan-Meier curve, and Cox proportional hazards models to 
evaluate the association between RDW and clinical outcomes. We then performed 
subgroup analyses to investigate the stability of the associations between RDW 
and all-cause mortality.
RESULTS: Nonlinear and J-shaped curves were observed in the generalized additive 
model. Kaplan-Meier analysis showed that patients with elevated RDW had a lower 
survival rate. The Cox regression model indicated that high levels of RDW were 
most closely associated with ICU mortality and 30-day mortality (HR = 4.71, 95% 
CI: 1.69-11.64 and HR = 6.62, 95% CI: 2.84-15.41). Subgroup analyses indicated 
that the associations between RDW and all-cause mortality were stable.
CONCLUSIONS: Elevated levels of RDW were associated with an increased risk of 
all-cause mortality, and RDW could be an independent prognostic factor for 
kidney failure.

BACKGROUND: This study aimed to develop an algorithm using the explainable 
artificial intelligence (XAI) approaches for the early prediction of mortality 
in intensive care unit (ICU) patients with acute kidney injury (AKI).
METHODS: This study gathered clinical data with AKI patients from the Medical 
Information Mart for Intensive Care IV (MIMIC-IV) in the US between 2008 and 
2019. All the data were further randomly divided into a training cohort and a 
validation cohort. Seven machine learning methods were used to develop the 
models for assessing in-hospital mortality. The optimal model was selected based 
on its accuracy and area under the curve (AUC). The SHapley Additive exPlanation 
(SHAP) values and Local Interpretable Model-Agnostic Explanations (LIME) 
algorithm were utilized to interpret the optimal model.
RESULTS: A total of 22,360 patients with AKI were finally enrolled in this study 
(median age, 69.5 years; female, 42.8%). They were randomly split into a 
training cohort (16770, 75%) and a validation cohort (5590, 25%). The eXtreme 
Gradient Boosting (XGBoost) model achieved the best performance with an AUC of 
0.890. The SHAP values showed that Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS), blood urea 
nitrogen, cumulative urine output on Day 1 and age were the top 4 most important 
variables contributing to the XGBoost model. The LIME algorithm was used to 
explain the individualized predictions.
CONCLUSIONS: Machine-learning models based on clinical features were developed 
and validated with great performance for the early prediction of a high risk of 
death in patients with AKI.

BACKGROUND: The triglyceride-glucose (TyG) index has demonstrated correlations 
with adverse clinical outcomes in patients with ischaemic stroke, coronary heart 
disease and cardiac failure. However, its association with overall mortality in 
individuals concurrently experiencing heart failure (HF) and chronic kidney 
disease (CKD) remains inadequately explored.
METHODS: Utilizing the Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care IV (Version 
2.2) repository, subjects underwent quartile stratification based on the TyG 
index. The primary endpoint was all-cause mortality during hospitalization. Cox 
proportional hazard models were employed to examine the correlation between TyG 
and all-cause mortality in HF patients with CKD. Evaluation involved 
Kaplan-Meier (KM) analysis and restricted cubic splines (RCSs) to compare 
mortality rates during hospitalization and 1 year after admission across cohorts 
with varying TyG index levels.
RESULTS: A cohort of 1537 HF and CKD patients participated. Cox regression 
analysis revealed elevated TyG levels as an independent risk factor for both 
in-hospital and 1 year mortality. RCS analysis indicated a rising, non-linear 
association between TyG levels and all-cause mortality (P value for non-linear 
<0.001). KM survival curves demonstrated a statistically significant reduction 
in survival rates within the high TyG index group compared with the low one 
(log-rank P < 0.001).
CONCLUSIONS: The TyG index exhibited substantial independent prognostic value 
for elevated in-hospital and 1 year all-cause mortality among the cohort with HF 
and CKD. These findings suggest that assessing the TyG index could play a 
crucial role in developing novel therapeutic strategies to improve outcomes for 
this high-risk demographic.

BACKGROUND: The aim of this study was to explore the relationship between the 
hemoglobin glycation index (HGI) of Congestive Heart Failure (CHF) patients and 
their risk of mortality within 365 days.
PATIENTS AND METHODS: The Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care (MIMIC-IV) 
database supplied the patient data for this study, which was categorized into 
quartiles based on the HGI. The primary endpoint was all-cause mortality within 
a 365-day period. Kaplan-Meier (K-M) analysis was utilized to compare this 
primary endpoint across the four aforementioned groups. The relationship between 
the HGI and the endpoint was examined using restricted cubic splines (RCS) and a 
Cox proportional hazards analysis.
RESULTS: A total of 985 patients were included in this study. HGI was 
significantly associated with 30 days mortality (15.9%; HR, 0.79; 95% CI, 
(0.67~0.92); P=0.003) and 60 days mortality (19.3%; HR, 0.83; 95% CI, 
(0.72~0.96); P=0.011) and 90 days mortality (22.1%; HR, 0.86; 95% CI, 
(0.75~0.99); P=0.031) and 365 days mortality (30.7%; HR, 0.97; 95% CI, 
(0.86~1.09); P=0.611) in patients with critical CHF in the completely adjusted 
Cox proportional risk model. RCS analysis revealed a U-shaped relationship 
between HGI and outcome events. KM curves survival analysis suggests a 
correlation between 30 days and 365 days mortality in HGI and CHF patients.
CONCLUSIONS: A higher HGI has a more protective effect than a low HGI for 
patients with CHF and was directly associated with short-term mortality rates. 
These findings may be helpful in the management of patients with CHF.

BACKGROUND: Malnutrition is common in patients with acute myocardial infarction 
(AMI) and is associated with a poor prognosis. The prognostic value of the 
prognostic nutritional index (PNI) in patients with AMI remains controversial. 
We aimed to explore the relationship between PNI and all-cause mortality in 
critically ill patients with AMI and evaluate the incremental prognostic value 
of PNI to commonly used prognostic assessment tools.
METHODS: The Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care-IV (MIMIC-IV) database 
was used to conduct a retrospective cohort analysis on 1180 critically ill 
patients with AMI. The primary endpoints were defined as 6-month and 1-year 
all-cause mortality. Cox regression analysis was used to investigate the 
relationship between admission PNI and all-cause mortality. The effect of adding 
PNI to sequential organ failure assessment (SOFA) score, or charlson comorbidity 
index (CCI) on its discriminative ability was assessed using C-statistic, net 
reclassification improvement (NRI), and integrated discrimination improvement 
(IDI).
RESULTS: Multivariate cox regression analysis demonstrated that the low PNI was 
regarded as an independent predictor of 1-year all-cause mortality in AMI 
patients admitted to ICU (adjusted Hazard Ratio: 95% CI = 1.75 (1.22-2.49)). The 
ROC test showed that admission PNI had a moderate predictive ability to predict 
all-cause mortality of critically ill patients with AMI. Furthermore, the net 
reclassification and integrated discrimination of the CCI alone model improved 
significantly with PNI. [C-statistic increased from 0.669 to 0.752, p < 0.001; 
NRI = 0.698, p < 0.001; IDI = 0.073, p < 0.001]. When PNI was added to the SOFA 
score, the C-statistic significantly improved from 0.770 to 0.805 (p < 0.001), 
and the NRI and IDI were estimated at 0.573 (p < 0.001) and 0.041 (p < 0.001), 
respectively.
CONCLUSION: PNI could be a novel predictor for identifying patients at high risk 
of 1-year all-cause mortality in critically ill patients with AMI. The addition 
of PNI to the SOFA score or CCI may be useful for very early risk 
stratification.

BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Acute variceal bleeding (AVB) is a life-threatening 
complication of cirrhosis. Acute-on-chronic liver failure (ACLF) is a syndrome 
characterized by acute decompensation of cirrhosis, multiple organ failures and 
high short-term mortality. This study aimed to evaluate the role of ACLF in the 
risk stratification of cirrhotic patients with AVB.
METHODS: Prospective data of 335 cirrhotic patients hospitalized for AVB were 
retrospectively extracted from Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care 
(MIMIC)-IV database. ACLF was defined by European Association for the Study of 
Liver-Chronic Liver Failure Consortium and diagnosed/graded with chronic liver 
failure-organ failure (CLIF-OF) score. Cox-proportional hazards regression 
analysis was performed to identify the risk factors for 6-week morality in AVB 
patients. Discrimination and calibration of prognostic scores were evaluated by 
plotting the receiver operating characteristics (ROC) curve and calibration 
curve, respectively. Overall performance was assessed by calculating the Brier 
score and R2 value.
RESULTS: A total of 181 (54.0%) patients were diagnosed with ACLF (grade 1: 
18.2%, grade 2: 33.7%, grade 3: 48.1%) at admission. The 6-week mortality in 
patients with ACLF was significantly higher than that in patients without ACLF 
(43.6% vs. 8.4%, P < 0.001) and increased in line with the severity of ACLF 
(22.5%, 34.2% and 63.8% for ACLF grade 1, 2 and 3, P < 0.001). In 
multivariate analysis, presence of ACLF remained as an independent risk factor 
for 6-week mortality after adjusting for confounding factors (HR = 2.12, 
P = 0.03). The discrimination, calibration and overall performance of CLIF-C 
ACLF and CLIF-C AD were superior to the traditional prognostic scores (CTP, MELD 
and MELD-Na) in the prediction of 6-week mortality of patients with and without 
ACLF, respectively.
CONCLUSION: The prognosis of cirrhotic patients with AVB is poor when 
accompanied by ACLF. ACLF at admission is an independent predictor for the 
6-week mortality in cirrhotic patients with AVB. CLIF-C ACLF and CLIF-C AD are 
the best prognostic scores in AVB patients with and without ACLF, respectively, 
and can be used for the risk stratification of these two distinct entities.

BACKGROUND: Sepsis is a globally recognized health issue that continues to 
contribute significantly to mortality and morbidity in intensive care units 
(ICUs). The association between mean arterial pressure (MAP) and prognosis among 
patients with patients is yet to be demonstrated.
OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to explore the association between MAP and 
28-day mortality in ICU patients with sepsis using data from a large, 
multicenter database.
METHODS: This is a retrospective cohort study. We extracted data of 35,010 
patients with sepsis from the MIMIC-IV (Medical Information Mart for Intensive 
Care) database between 2008 and 2019, according to the Sepsis 3.0 diagnostic 
criteria. The MAP was calculated as the average of the highest and lowest 
readings within the first 24 hours of ICU admission, and patients were divided 
into 4 groups based on the mean MAP, using the quadruple classification 
approach. Other worst-case indications from the first 24 hours of ICU admission, 
such as vital signs, severity of illness scores, laboratory indicators, and 
therapies, were also gathered as baseline data. The independent effects of MAP 
on 28-day mortality were explored using binary logistic regression and a 
two-piecewise linear model, with MAP as the exposure and 28-day mortality as the 
outcome variables, respectively. To address the nonlinearity relationship, curve 
fitting and a threshold effect analysis were performed.
RESULTS: A total of 34,981 patients with sepsis were included in the final 
analysis, the mean age was 66.67 (SD 16.01) years, and the 28-day mortality rate 
was 16.27% (5691/34,981). The generalized additive model and smoothed curve 
fitting found a U-shaped relationship between MAP and 28-day mortality in these 
patients. The recursive algorithm determined the low and high inflection points 
as 70 mm and 82 mm Hg, respectively. Our data demonstrated that MAP was 
negatively associated with 28-day mortality in the range of 34.05 mm Hg-69.34 mm 
Hg (odds ratio [OR] 0.93, 95% CI 0.92-0.94; P<.001); however, once the MAP 
exceeded 82 mm Hg, a positive association existed between MAP and 28-day 
mortality of patients with sepsis (OR 1.01; 95% CI 1.01-1.02, P=.002).
CONCLUSIONS: There is a U-shaped association between MAP and the probability of 
28-day mortality in patients with sepsis. Both the lower and higher MAP were 
related with a higher risk of mortality in patients with sepsis. These patients 
have a decreased risk of mortality when their MAP remains between 70 and 82 mm 
Hg.

PURPOSE: We investigated the prognostic accuracy of scores of SOFA for 90-day 
mortality in patients with kidney transplant status identified from the public 
Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care III databank.
METHODS: A total of 428 participants with kidney transplant status who were 
admitted for the first time to the ICU were included. The target-independent and 
target-dependent variables were the SOFA scores in the first 3 days of ICU 
admission and 90-day mortality, respectively.
RESULTS: Fully adjusted binary logistic regression indicated that the day-2 and 
day-3 SOFA scores were positively associated with a risk of 90-day mortality 
after adjustment for confounders (odds ratio: 1.196, 95% confidence interval: 
1.052-1.360; odds ratio: 1.233, 95% confidence interval: 1.062-1.432). The 
receiver operating characteristic curve showed areas under the curve for the 
prediction of 90-day mortality from SOFA scores on days 1, 2 and 3 were 0.524, 
0.654, and 0.727, respectively. Further analysis using Kaplan-Meier survival 
curves and multivariate regression models of 90-day survival showed that 
patients with low SOFA scores survived longer than those with high scores.
CONCLUSION: The SOFA scores in the early days of ICU admission were positively 
associated with 90-day outcomes although the first-day score showed no 
significant correlation.

BACKGROUND: Traumatic brain injury (TBI) patients suffer high risks of 
mortality. Ondansetron has been verified to be effective in improving the 
prognosis of some kinds of critically ill patients. We design this study to 
explore whether ondansetron use is associated with lower risks of mortality 
among TBI patients.
METHODS: TBI patients from the Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care-III 
were collected. The usage of ondansetron, including intravenous injection and 
oral tablet, since admission to the Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center between 
2001 and 2012 was identified. Univariate and multivariate logistic regression 
were performed to analyze the relationship between the ondansetron use and 
mortality of TBI patients. Propensity score matching (PSM) was utilized to 
generate balanced cohorts of the non-ondansetron use group and ondansetron use 
group. Sub-group analysis was performed to verify the association between the 
ondansetron use and mortality of TBI patients in different TBI severity levels 
after PSM.
RESULTS: In TBI cohorts before PSM, the usage incidence of ondansetron was 
37.2%. The 30-day mortality was significantly lower in the ondansetron group (p 
< 0.001). The multivariate logistic regression showed that ondansetron was 
associated with the lower mortality of TBI patients (p = 0.008). In TBI cohorts 
after PSM, the 30-day mortality of the ondansetron group was lower than that of 
the non-ondansetron group, although without statistical significance (p = 
0.079). Logistic regression indicated ondansetron use was significantly 
associated with the lower mortality of moderate-to-severe TBI (p < 0.001) but 
not mild TBI (p = 0.051). In addition, Cox regression also presented that 
ondansetron use was significantly associated with the lower mortality of 
moderate-to-severe TBI (p < 0.001) but not mild TBI (p = 0.052).
CONCLUSION: Ondansetron usage is associated with a lower mortality risk of 
moderate-to-severe TBI but not mild TBI patients. Ondansetron may be a novel 
adjunctive therapeutic strategy to improve the prognosis of moderate-to-severe 
TBI patients.

PURPOSE: The mortality rate of severe acute pancreatitis (AP) is 20-30% even 
after admission to intensive care unit (ICU). Thus we aimed to develop a 
laboratory-based nomogram to identify AP patients at high risk for mortality.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: The primary and validation cohorts were extracted from 
the Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care III database (MIMIC-III). 
Independent predictors were determined using multiple Cox analysis and then 
assembled to predict survival. The performance of proposed nomogram was 
evaluated by Harrell's concordance index (C-index) and area under the receiver 
operating characteristic (AUC) analysis, and subsequently compared with 
conventional scoring systems.
RESULTS: A total of 342 AP patients admitted to ICU were enrolled, with 30-day, 
180-day and 1-year mortality rate of 10.8%, 16.1% and 17.5%, respectively. 
Independent factors from multivariate Cox model to prognosticate 30-day and 
1-year mortality were retrieved. The C-index of 1-year prediction nomogram 
(0.758, 95%CI: 0.676-0.840) were superior to several prediction approaches, and 
these findings were further confirmed by applying time-specific AUC analysis. 
Decision curve analysis indicated our nomogram was feasible in clinical 
practice. Similar results were observed in the validation cohort.
CONCLUSIONS: The proposed nomogram gives rise to accurately prognostic 
prediction for critically AP patients admitted to ICU.

AIM: To explore the predictive value of lactate-to-albumin ratio (LAR) on 28-day 
mortality in patients with exacerbation of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease 
(AECOPD) admitted to the Intensive Care Unit (ICU).
METHODS: According to ICD-9 and ICD-10 diagnosis codes, patients diagnosed with 
AECOPD in the Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care IV (v.2.2) database 
were selected. The primary endpoint was 28-day mortality after ICU admission. We 
used receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve, Kaplan-Meier (K-M) survival 
curve, logistic regression analyses and subgroup analysis to assess predictive 
power of LAR.
RESULTS: 606 patients were included in this study. The 28-day mortality was 
29.7%. The area under the ROC curves (AUC) for LAR were 0.641 [95% confidence 
interval (CI) 0.592-0.689], which was comparable with OASIS (AUC: 0.662; 95% CI 
0.616-0.709; p = 0.471) and SOFA (AUC: 0.660; 95% CI 0.612-0.708; p = 0.500). 
The cutoff value of LAR was 0.645 by ROC curve. The high-LAR group showed a bad 
prognosis in K-M analysis (p < 0.001). Multivariate logistic regression shown 
that LAR was significantly associated with a poor outcome (odds ratio: 1.77; 95% 
CI 1.16-2.71; p = 0.008). Subgroup analysis showed no significant interaction of 
LAR with each subgroup (p for interaction: 0.175-0.775).
CONCLUSION: LAR is a rational and easily accessible marker, which is remarkably 
associated with 28-day mortality in ICU patients with AECOPD.

BACKGROUND: Noninvasive ventilation (NIV) failure is strongly associated with 
poor prognosis. Nowadays, plenty of mature studies have been proposed to predict 
early NIV failure (within 48 hours of NIV), however, the prediction for late NIV 
failure (after 48 hours of NIV) lacks sufficient research. Late NIV failure 
delays intubation resulting in the increasing mortality of the patients. 
Therefore, it is of great significance to expeditiously predict the late NIV 
failure. In order to dynamically predict late NIV failure, we proposed a Time 
Updated Light Gradient Boosting Machine (TULightGBM) model.
MATERIAL AND METHODS: In this work, 5653 patients undergoing NIV over 48 hours 
were extracted from the database of Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care 
Ⅲ (MIMIC-Ⅲ) for model construction. The TULightGBM model consists of a series of 
sub-models which learn clinical information from updating data within 48 hours 
of NIV and integrates the outputs of the sub-models by the dynamic attention 
mechanism to predict late NIV failure. The performance of the proposed 
TULightGBM model was assessed by comparison with common models of logistic 
regression (LR), random forest (RF), LightGBM, eXtreme gradient boosting 
(XGBoost), artificial neural network (ANN), and long short-term memory (LSTM).
RESULTS: The TULightGBM model yielded prediction results at 8, 16, 24, 36, and 
48 hours after the start of the NIV with dynamic AUC values of 0.8323, 0.8435, 
0.8576, 0.8886, and 0.9123, respectively. Furthermore, the sensitivity, 
specificity, and accuracy of the TULightGBM model were 0.8207, 0.8164, and 
0.8184, respectively. The proposed model achieved superior performance over 
other tested models.
CONCLUSIONS: The TULightGBM model is able to dynamically predict the late NIV 
failure with high accuracy and offer potential decision support for clinical 
practice.

Background: The relationship between urine output (UO) and in-hospital mortality 
in intensive care patients with septic shock is currently inconclusive. Methods: 
The baseline data, UO, and in-hospital prognosis of intensive care patients with 
septic shock were retrieved from the Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care 
IV (MIMIC-IV) database. By drawing receiver operating characteristic (ROC) 
curves and comparing the areas under the ROC curves (AUC) to determine the 
predictive value of UO for in-hospital mortality, and by drawing the 
Kaplan-Meier curves to compare the difference in in-hospital mortality between 
different groups of UO. Results: Before and after the propensity score matching 
(PSM) analysis, UO was always a risk factor for in-hospital mortality in 
patients with septic shock. The AUC of UO was comparable to the Sequential Organ 
Failure Assessment (SOFA) scoring system, while the AUC of combining UO and SOFA 
was greater than that of SOFA. The median survival time of the high-UO group (UO 
> 0.39 ml/kg/h, before PSM; UO > 0.38 ml/kg/h, after PSM) was longer than that 
of the low-UO group. Compared with the high-UO group, the hazard ratios (HR) of 
the low-UO group were 2.6857 (before PSM) and 1.7879 (after PSM). Conclusions: 
UO is an independent risk factor for septic shock. Low levels of UO 
significantly increase the in-hospital mortality of intensive care patients with 
septic shock. The predictive value of UO is comparable to the SOFA scoring 
system, and the combined predictive value of the two surpasses SOFA alone.

Intracranial hemorrhage (ICH) is a neurological emergency with a poor prognosis. 
This study aimed to understand the association between hemoglobin levels, red 
blood cell distribution width ratio (HRR), and mortality in patients with ICH. 
Information on patients with ICH was extracted from the Medical Information Mart 
for Intensive Care IV (MIMIC-IV) database. Cox proportional risk models were 
used to assess the relationship between HRR and 28-day and 90-day mortality, and 
constructed by adjusting for relevant covariates. Segmented regression models 
and smoothing curves were used to analyze the linear relationship between HRR 
and mortality. This study recruited 4,716 patients with ICH. The HRR Q4 group 
was negatively associated with the 28- and 90-day mortality. For patients 
aged > 65 years, the right-hand threshold inflection points of the HRR were 0.92 
and 0.93, respectively, which were negatively associated with 28-day mortality 
(HR:0.06, 95% CI 0.01, 0.35, p = 0.0016) and with 90-day mortality (p = 0.0006). 
In the non-linear model, both 28-day mortality (HR, 0.17; 95% CI 0.04-0.75, 
p = 0.0191; HRR > 0.89) and 90-day mortality (HR, 0.13; 95% CI 0.04-0.49, 
p = 0.0022; HRR > 0.85) were associated in men. In the subgroup analysis, the 
negative association between HRR and mortality was more pronounced in 
patients > 65 years of age, as well as in patients with non-dementia, diabetes, 
and malignant cancer. We found a non-linear relationship between mortality and 
the HRR in elderly patients, and a higher HRR was negatively associated with 
mortality in patients with ICH.

AIMS: The stress hyperglycemia ratio (SHR) is significantly associated with 
short-term adverse cardiovascular events. However, the association between SHR 
and mortality after the acute phase of acute coronary syndrome (ACS) remains 
controversial.
METHODS: This study used data from the Medical Information Mart for Intensive 
Care-IV database. Patients with ACS hospitalized in the intensive care unit 
(ICU) were retrospectively enrolled.
RESULTS: A total of 2668 ACS patients were enrolled. The incidence of 
in-hospital and 1-year mortality was 4.7 % and 13.2 %, respectively. The maximum 
SHR had a higher prognostic value for predicting both in-hospital and 1-year 
mortality than the first SHR. Adding the maximum SHR to the SOFA score could 
significantly improve the prognostic prediction. In the landmark analysis at 
30 days, the maximum SHR was a risk factor for mortality within 30 days 
regardless of whether patients had diabetes. However, it was no longer 
associated with mortality after 30 days in patients with diabetes after 
adjustment (HR = 1.237 per 1-point increment, 95 % CI 0.854-1.790).
CONCLUSIONS: The maximum SHR was significantly associated with mortality in 
patients with ACS hospitalized in the ICU. However, caution is warranted if it 
is used for predicting mortality after 30 days in patients with diabetes.

BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Marital status has been shown to be associated with 
mortality, but evidence in critically ill elder intensive care unit (ICU) 
patients with cerebrovascular diseases (CeVD) is limited. This study was to 
explore the correlation between marital status and the prognosis of patients 
with CeVD aged 65 years and over in the ICU.
METHODS: In the present study, 3564 patients were enrolled in the Medical 
Information Mart for Intensive Care IV database (version 2.2). Patients were 
divided into four groups based on marital status: married, single, divorced, and 
widowed. The primary outcome was all-cause mortality as patients were followed 
up for 3-, 6-, 9-, and 12-month. All-cause mortality risk for patients with 
different marital status was compared. Univariate and multivariable logistic 
regression analyses, survival curves and stratified analyses were performed to 
determine the correlation between marital status and mortality in critically ill 
patients with CeVD aged ≥65 years.
RESULTS: Of the patients, 51.2% (1825/3564) were married, followed by 23.8% 
(847/3564) were widowed, 18.2% (647/3564) were single, and 6.9% (245/3567) were 
divorced. Compared with the married, the unmarried had a higher proportion of 
female (p < 0.001), older (p < 0.001), and less proportion of mechanical 
ventilation (p = 0.045). Multivariate analyses showed that no differences were 
observed for mortality risk among different marital statuses (p > 0.05), while 
at late follow-up, widowed had a significance higher mortality risk than the 
married (9-month: odds ratio [OR]: 1.30, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 
1.05-1.61, p = 0.02; 12-month: OR: 1.38, 95% CI: 1.12-1.71, p = 0.003). 
Stratified analyses indicated a stable correlation between marital status and 
12-month mortality rate in sub-analysis for gender (p = 0.46) and age

AIMS: Acute myocardial infarction (AMI) is a cardiovascular disease with high 
morbidity and mortality. We collected patients with AMI from the Medical 
Information Mart for Intensive Care IV (v2.0) database and explored the 
association between serum albumin-corrected anion gap (ACAG) level and mortality 
in patients with AMI.
METHODS AND RESULTS: Data of adult patients with AMI were collected. According 
to the 360 day prognosis, patients were divided into survival and non-survival 
groups. Based on the ACAG level, patients were then divided into normal and high 
ACAG groups. Cox hazard proportional models and restricted cubic splines (RCSs) 
were used to investigate the correlation between ACAG and mortality. 
Kaplan-Meier curves were created to compare the cumulative survival rates 
between the high and normal ACAG groups. The receiver operating characteristic 
(ROC) curve was used to analyse the predictive value of ACAG for the prognosis 
of patients with AMI. Sensitivity and subgroup analyses were conducted to 
revalidate the results. Finally, 1783 patients were included. Elevated ACAG 
(>20 mmol/L) was significantly associated with 30 and 360 day mortality 
(P < 0.001). Adjusted for multiple confounding factors, the Cox proportional 
hazard analysis showed that elevated ACAG (>20 mmol/L) was an independent risk 
factor of increased all-cause mortality in patients with AMI (hazard ratio 
1.423, 95% confidence interval 1.206-1.678, P < 0.001). RCS analysis further 
showed that there was a non-linear trend relationship between ACAG and the risk 
of all-cause mortality at 30 and 360 days (χ2 = 10.750, P = 0.013; χ2 = 13.960, 
P = 0.003). Kaplan-Meier survival curves showed that the 30 and 360 day 
cumulative survival rates of patients with AMI were significantly lower 
(log-rank test, χ2 = 98.880, P < 0.001; χ2 = 105.440, P < 0.001) in the high 
ACAG group. ROC curve analysis showed that the area under the curve (AUC) of 
ACAG was 0.651, while the AUC of anion gap (AG) was 0.609, indicating that ACAG 
had a higher predictive value for 360 day mortality than AG. When combined with 
Sequential Organ Failure Assessment score, the predictive performance of ACAG 
for 360 day mortality was better, with an AUC of 0.699. Sensitivity and subgroup 
analyses were conducted suggesting the stability of our results.
CONCLUSIONS: Elevated serum ACAG (≥20 mmol/L) is an independent risk factor for 
short-term and long-term mortality in critically ill patients with AMI, and it 
may assist clinicians and nurses identifying high-risk patients.

Although accumulating researches were done for investigating the relationship 
between triglyceride-glucose index (TyG index) and different diseases, none of 
the researches have been made in sepsis yet. In this study, we aimed to explore 
the relationship between TyG index and clinical outcomes in sepsis based on a 
large critical care public database. Sepsis patients in Medical Information Mart 
for Intensive Care IV (MIMIC-IV) Database were included. The exposure was TyG 
index, which was calculated by the equation: ln (TG (mg/dL) × FBG (mg/dL)/2). 
The outcomes were in-hospital mortality and 1-year mortality. The relationship 
between TyG index and outcomes was performed by Cox regression analysis. Smooth 
fitting curves were constructed by using generalized additive model. 
Kaplan-Meier analyses for cumulative hazard of 1-year mortality in different 
groups were done. 1103 sepsis patients were included with a median TyG index of 
9.78. The mortalities of in-hospital and 1-year were 37.53% (n = 414) and 42.25% 
(n = 466), respectively. After adjusting confounders, there was a significantly 
negative relationship between TyG index and mortalities of in-hospital and 
1-year. With the per unit increment in TyG index, the risk of in-hospital and 
1-year mortality both decreased by 21% (HR = 0.79, 95% CI: 0.66-0.94, p = 0.0086 
and HR = 0.79, 95% CI: 0.66-0.94, p = 0.0080, respectively). A negative 
relationship between TyG index and clinical outcomes in sepsis was found.

BACKGROUND: Recent studies reported that serum anion gap could be regarded as a 
prognostic biomarker for patients admitted to intensive care units. However, the 
association between AG and mortality in cerebral infarction patients remained 
largely unknown.
METHODS: Relevant clinical data were collected from Medical Information Mart for 
Intensive Care III. Patients were divided into three groups according to 
tertiles of AG. Kaplan-Meier curve and Cox proportional hazards models were used 
to evaluate the association between AG levels and all-cause mortality. Subgroup 
analyses were performed to verify the predictive role of AG on mortality.
RESULTS: Kaplan-Meier analysis showed that patients with higher AG had shorter 
survival time. Cox regression model indicated high AG as an independent risk 
factor of 30-day, 60-day and 180-day all-cause mortality (30-day: HR = 2.45, 95% 
CI = 1.21-4.97, 60-day: HR = 2.04, 95% CI = 1.07-3.89, and 180-day: HR = 1.85, 
95% CI = 1.02-3.36). However, no significance was observed between AG and 
365-day all-cause mortality (HR = 1.56, 95% CI = 0.87-2.78).
CONCLUSIONS: High AG was associated with increased risk of all-cause mortality, 
and AG could be an independent short-term prognostic factor for cerebral 
infarction.

BACKGROUND: The albumin-bilirubin (ALBI) score has demonstrated prognostic value 
in a range for liver and heart diseases. However, its association with all-cause 
mortality in intensive care unit (ICU) patients with heart failure remains 
uncertain.
OBJECTIVE: This study sought to investigate the relationship between the ALBI 
score and the risk of all-cause mortality in ICU patients with heart failure.
METHODS AND RESULTS: The ICU patients diagnosed with heart failure were selected 
from the Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care IV database (MIMIC-IV, 
version 2.2) and stratified into tertiles according to their ALBI scores. The 
primary outcome of interest was the occurrence of all-cause mortality within 365 
days post-discharge. The analysis encompassed a cohort of 4,239 patients, with 
Kaplan-Meier curves indicating that individuals with higher ALBI levels 
exhibited an elevated risk of all-cause mortality (log-rank p < 0.001). 
Multivariate adjusted Cox regression and subgroup analysis demonstrated that 
individuals in T2 (hazard ratio (HR) 1.09, 95% CI 0.99-1.21) and T3 (HR 1.17, 
95% CI 1.02-1.34) had an increased risk of mortality compared to individuals in 
T1 (p for trend < 0.001), and each incremental tertile in ALBI was linked to a 
10% rise in mortality risk, while each individual unit increase in ALBI was 
associated with a 36% increase in mortality risk. This relationship was 
consistently observed across most subgroups, except for using or not using 
inotropes or vasopressors, different ages, different creatinine levels. The 
restricted cubic spline (RCS) analysis indicated a linear relationship between 
ALBI levels and the risk of all-cause mortality.
CONCLUSION: The ALBI scores are independently associated with the risk of 
all-cause mortality in ICU patients with heart failure, particularly in those 
not using inotropes or vasopressors, younger patients, and with lower levels of 
creatinine. ALBI may help identify high-risk patients and optimize risk 
stratification in this population.

Previous studies have suggested that levels of sodium and chloride in the blood 
may be indicative of the prognosis of different medical conditions. 
Nevertheless, the assessment of the prognostic significance of the 
sodium-to-chloride (Na/Cl) ratio in relation to in-hospital mortality among 
individuals suffering from acute heart failure (AHF) remains unexplored. In this 
study, the participants were selected from the Medical Information Mart for 
Intensive Care IV database and divided into three groups based on the Na/Cl 
ratio level upon admission. The primary results were the mortality rate within 
the hospital. Cox regression, Kaplan-Meier curves, receiver operator 
characteristic (ROC) curve analysis and subgroup analyses were utilized to 
investigate the correlation between the admission Na/Cl ratio and outcomes in 
critically ill patients with AHF. A total of 7844 patients who met the selection 
criteria were included in this study. After adjusting for confounders, the 
multivariable Cox regression analysis revealed that the baseline Na/Cl ratio 
significantly elevated the risk of in-hospital mortality among critically ill 
patients with AHF (HR = 1.34, 95% CI 1.21-1.49). Furthermore, when the Na/Cl 
ratio was converted into a categorical factor and the initial tertile was taken 
as a point of comparison, the hazard ratios (HRs) and 95% confidence intervals 
(CIs) for the second and third tertiles were 1.27 (1.05-1.54) and 1.53 
(1.27-1.84), respectively. Additionally, a P value indicating a significant 
trend of < 0.001 was observed. ROC curve analysis showed that Na/Cl ratio had a 
more sensitive prognostic value in predicting in-hospital mortality of AHF than 
the sodium or chloride level alone (0.564 vs. 0.505, 0.544). Subgroup 
examinations indicated that the association between the Na/Cl ratio upon 
admission and the mortality rate of critically ill patients with AHF remained 
consistent in the subgroups of hyponatremia and hypochlorhydria (P for 
interaction > 0.05). The linear relationship between the Na/Cl ratio and 
in-hospital mortality in AHF patients indicates a positive association.

OBJECTIVE: To investigate the effect of different single and combined 
pre-admission antihypertensive drug regimens on the prognosis of critically ill 
patients.
METHODS: We performed a retrospective cohort study using data from the Medical 
Information Mart for Intensive Care-IV (MIMIC-IV) database. All initial ICU 
admission records of patients with hypertension and previous antihypertensive 
exposure before ICU admission were included. Our primary outcome was 90-day 
mortality. Propensity score matching (PSM) and inverse probability of treatment 
weighting (IPTW) were used to balance the distribution of baseline 
characteristics. Logistic regression analysis and subgroup analysis were 
performed to determine the independent effect of different single and combined 
antihypertensive drug regimens on 90-day mortality.
RESULTS: A total of 13,142 patients were included in the final analysis. The 
90-day mortality rate in the combined groups is lower than that in the single 
therapy group (10.94% vs 11.12%), but no statistical significance was found in 
the original cohort (p = 0.742). After adjustment for potential confounders, the 
significantly decreased 90-day mortality rate was found in the combined groups 
(10.78% vs 12.65%, p = 0.004 in PSM; 10.34% vs 11.90%, p = 0.007). Patients who 
were exposed to either ACEIs or ARBs had a better prognosis than those not 
exposed (7.19% vs 17.08%, p < 0.001 in single antihypertensive groups; 8.14% 
vs18.91%, p < 0.001 in combined antihypertensive groups). The results keep 
robustness in the PSM and IPTW cohorts. In the logistic regression model 
analysis, combined therapy was associated with a 12%-20% reduced risk of 90-day 
death after adjusting potential confounders (OR 0.80-0.88, all p < 0.05), while 
exposure to ACEIs or ARBs was associated with the decreased risk of 90-day death 
by 52%-62% (OR 0.38-0.48, all p < 0.001) and 40%-62% (OR 0.38-0.60, all p < 
0.001) in the single and combined therapy groups, respectively. The results were 
still robust to subgroup analysis.
CONCLUSIONS: Pre-admission combined antihypertensive therapy is associated with 
a significantly lower risk of death than exposure to single antihypertensives in 
critically ill patients. Meanwhile, either ACEIs or ARBs seem to be the optimal 
candidates for both single and combined therapy. Further high-quality trials are 
needed to confirm our findings.

BACKGROUND: Elderly acute kidney injury (AKI) occurring in the intensive care 
unit (ICU), particularly when caused or accompanied by sepsis, is linked to 
extended hospital stays, increased mortality rates, heightened prevalence of 
chronic diseases, and diminished quality of life. This study primarily utilizes 
a comprehensive critical care database to examine the correlation of albumin 
corrected anion gap (ACAG) levels with short-term prognosis in elderly patients 
with AKI caused or accompanied by sepsis, thus assisting physicians in early 
identification of high-risk patients.
METHODS: This study utilized data from the Medical Information Mart for 
Intensive Care IV (MIMIC-IV, v2.0) database. The patient population was divided 
into death and survival groups based on a 14-day prognosis. Subsequently, the 
entire population was further categorized into a normal ACAG group 
(12-20 mmol/L) and a high ACAG group (> 20 mmol/L) based on ACAG levels. The 
LASSO regression cross-validation method was employed to identify significant 
risk factors for inclusion in multivariate Cox regression analyses. A restricted 
cubic spline (RCS) was then employed to visually represent the correlation 
between ACAG levels and the risk of mortality in patients. Kaplan-Meier curves 
were utilized to plot the cumulative survival rates at 14 and 30 days for both 
patient groups. The robustness of the findings was subsequently evaluated 
through subgroup analyses.
RESULTS: Our study identified a total of 3741 eligible subjects, revealing 
higher all-cause mortality rates at both 14-day and 30-day intervals in the high 
ACAG group compared to the normal ACAG group (χ2 = 87.023, P < 0.001; 
χ2 = 90.508, P < 0.001). Cox regression analysis further demonstrated that an 
elevated ACAG on ICU admission independently posed a risk factor for both 14- 
and 30-day prognosis within this population. In addition, the analysis conducted 
using RCS revealed a non-linear association between the levels of ACAG and the 
risk of mortality at both 14 and 30 days in the patient cohort (χ2 = 18.220, 
P < 0.001; χ2 = 18.360, P < 0.001). The application of Kaplan-Meier analysis 
demonstrated a statistically significant decrease in cumulative survival rates 
among individuals with high ACAG levels (P < 0.001). Subgroup analyses indicated 
that ACAG levels interacted with cerebrovascular disease and acute pancreatitis 
on 14-day mortality (P < 0.05 for interaction).
CONCLUSION: Elevated ACAG levels at ICU admission are an independent risk factor 
for poor short-term prognosis, correlating with increased all-cause mortality at 
14 and 30 days in elderly patients with AKI caused or accompanied by sepsis. 
This highlights the importance of monitoring ACAG in critically ill patients to 
identify those at higher risk of adverse outcomes early.

BACKGROUND: Conventional systemic inflammatory biomarkers could predict 
prognosis in patients with ischemic stroke (IS) admitted to the intensive care 
unit (ICU). Acute kidney injury (AKI) is common in patients with IS admitted to 
ICU, but few studies have used systemic inflammatory biomarkers to predict AKI 
in critically ill patients with IS. This study aimed to establish a risk model 
based on white blood cell (WBC)-related biomarkers to predict AKI in critically 
ill patients with IS.
METHODS: Data were extracted from the Medical Information Mart for Intensive 
Care-IV (MIMIC-IV) for a training cohort, and data were extracted from the 
Medical Information Mart for eICU Collaborative Research Database (eICU-CRD) for 
a validation cohort. Logistic regression analysis was used to determine the 
significant predictors of WBC-related biomarkers on AKI prediction, and a risk 
model was established based on those significant indicators in multivariate 
logistic regression. The receiver operating characteristics (ROC) curve was 
utilized to obtain the best cut-off value of the risk model. The Kaplan-Meier 
curve was used to evaluate the prognosis-predictive ability of the risk model.
RESULTS: The overall incidence of AKI was 28.4% in the training cohort and 33.2% 
in the validation cohort. WBC to lymphocyte ratio (WLR), WBC to basophils ratio 
(WBR), WBC to hemoglobin ratio (WHR), and neutrophil to lymphocyte ratio (NLR) 
could independently predict AKI, and a novel risk model was established based on 
WLR, WBR, WHR, and NLR. This risk model depicted good prediction performance 
both in AKI and other clinical outcomes including hemorrhage, persistent AKI, 
AKI progression, ICU mortality, and in-hospital mortality both in the training 
set and in the validation set.
CONCLUSION: A risk model based on WBC-related indicators exhibited good AKI 
prediction performance in critically ill patients with IS which could provide a 
risk stratification tool for clinicians in the ICU.

Background: In intensive care units (ICUs), the morbidity and mortality of 
ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) are relatively high, and this condition 
also increases medical expenses for mechanically ventilated patients, which will 
seriously affect the prognoses of critically ill patients. The purpose of this 
study was to determine the impact of bronchoscopy on the prognosis of patients 
with VAP undergoing invasive mechanical ventilation (IMV). Methods: This was a 
retrospective study based on patients with VAP from the Medical Information Mart 
for Intensive Care IV database. The outcomes were ICU and in-hospital mortality. 
Patients were divided based on whether or not they had undergone bronchoscopy 
during IMV. Kaplan-Meier (KM) survival curves and Cox proportional-hazards 
regression models were used to analyze the association between groups and 
outcomes. Propensity score matching (PSM) and propensity score based inverse 
probability of treatment weighting (IPTW) were used to further verify the 
stability of the results. The effect of bronchoscopy on prognosis was further 
analyzed by causal mediation analysis (CMA). Results: This study enrolled 1,560 
patients with VAP: 1,355 in the no-bronchoscopy group and 205 in the 
bronchoscopy group. The KM survival curve indicated a significant difference in 
survival probability between the two groups. The survival probabilities in both 
the ICU and hospital were significantly higher in the bronchoscopy group than in 
the no bronchoscopy group. After adjusting all covariates as confounding factors 
in the Cox model, the HRs (95% CI) for ICU and in-hospital mortality in the 
bronchoscopy group were 0.33 (0.20-0.55) and 0.40 (0.26-0.60), respectively, 
indicating that the risks of ICU and in-hospital mortality were 0.67 and 0.60 
lower than in the no-bronchoscopy group. The same trend was obtained after using 
PSM and IPTW. CMA showed that delta-red blood cell distribution width (RDW) 
mediated 8 and 7% of the beneficial effects of bronchoscopy in ICU mortality and 
in-hospital mortality. Conclusion: Bronchoscopy during IMV was associated with 
reducing the risk of ICU and in-hospital mortality in patients with VAP in ICUs, 
and this beneficial effect was partially mediated by changes in RDW levels.

BACKGROUND: Upper gastrointestinal (GI) bleeding is a common medical emergency. 
This study aimed to develop models to predict critically ill patients with upper 
GI bleeding in-hospital and 30-day survival, identify the correlation factor and 
infer the causality.
METHODS: A total of 2898 patients with upper GI bleeding were included from the 
Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care-IV and eICU-Collaborative Research 
Database, respectively. To identify the most critical factors contributing to 
the prognostic model, we used SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations) for machine 
learning interpretability. We performed causal inference using inverse 
probability weighting for survival-associated prognostic factors.
RESULTS: The optimal model using the light GBM (gradient boosting algorithm) 
algorithm achieved an AUC of .93 for in-hospital survival, .81 for 30-day 
survival in internal testing and .87 for in-hospital survival in external 
testing. Important factors for in-hospital survival, according to SHAP, were 
SOFA (Sequential organ failure assessment score), GCS (Glasgow coma scale) motor 
score and length of stay in ICU (Intensive critical care). In contrast, 
essential factors for 30-day survival were SOFA, length of stay in ICU, total 
bilirubin and GCS verbal score. Our model showed improved performance compared 
to SOFA alone.
CONCLUSIONS: Our interpretable machine learning model for predicting in-hospital 
and 30-day mortality in critically ill patients with upper gastrointestinal 
bleeding showed excellent accuracy and high generalizability. This model can 
assist clinicians in managing these patients to improve the discrimination of 
high-risk patients.

OBJECTIVES: We aimed to develop and validate a prognostic nomogram and evaluate 
the discrimination of the nomogram model in order to improve the prediction of 
30-day survival of critically ill myocardial infarction (MI) patients.
DESIGN: A retrospective cohort study.
SETTING: Data were collected from the Medical Information Mart for Intensive 
Care (MIMIC)-III database, consisting of critically ill participants between 
2001 and 2012 in the USA.
PARTICIPANTS: A total of 2031 adult critically ill patients with MI were 
enrolled from the MIMIC-III database.
PRIMARY AND SECONDARY OUTCOME: Thirty-day survival.
RESULTS: Independent prognostic factors, including age, heart rate, white blood 
cell count, blood urea nitrogen and bicarbonate, were identified by Cox 
regression model and used in the nomogram. Good agreement between the prediction 
and observation was indicated by the calibration curve for 30-day survival. The 
nomogram exhibited reasonably accurate discrimination (area under the receiver 
operating characteristic curve, 0.765, 95% CI, 0.716 to 0.814) and calibration 
(C-index, 0.758, 95% CI, 0.712 to 0.804) in the validation cohort. Decision 
curve analysis demonstrated that the nomogram was clinically beneficial. 
Additionally, participants could be classified into two risk groups by the 
nomogram, and the 30-day survival probability was significantly different 
between them (p<0.001).
CONCLUSION: This five-factor nomogram can achieve a reasonable degree of 
accuracy to predict 30-day survival in critically ill MI patients and might be 
helpful for risk stratification and decision-making for MI patients.

Acute kidney injury (AKI) is a serious complication in the intensive care unit 
(ICU), which may increase the mortality of critically ill patients. The red 
blood cell distribution width (RDW) has proved useful as a predictor of 
short-term prognosis in critically ill patients with AKI. However, it remains 
unknown whether RDW has a prognostic value of long-term all-cause mortality in 
these patients. The data of 18279 critically ill patients with AKI at first-time 
hospital admission were extracted from the Medical Information Mart for 
Intensive Care III (MIMIC-III) database. The tertiles of the RDW values were 
used to divide subjects into three groups, namely RDW < 13.6% for the low RDW 
group, 13.6% ≤ RDW < 15.2% for the middle RDW group and RDW ≥ 15.2% for the high 
RDW group. Demographic data, mortality, 4-year survival time and severity scale 
scores were compared among groups. The Kaplan-Meier analysis and the Cox 
regression analysis were performed to assess the impact of RDW on all-cause 
mortality in AKI patients. The receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve 
analysis was done to evaluate the prognostic value of RDW on the long-term 
outcome of critically ill patients with AKI. The median age of the enrolled 
subjects was 65.6 years. AKI patients with a higher RDW value had significantly 
shorter survival time and higher death rate. By the Kaplan-Meier analysis, 
patients in the higher RDW group presented significantly shorter survival time 
and higher death rate. The Cox regression model indicated RDW as an independent 
risk factor of all-cause mortality of AKI patients (HR 1.219, 95% CI, 1.211 to 
1.228). By the ROC analysis, RDW appeared more efficient in predicting long-term 
prognosis as compared with conventional severity scales. The AUC of RDW (95% CI, 
0.712 to 0.725) was significantly higher than other severity scale scores. In 
conclusion, RDW is positively correlated to survival time of 4-year follow-up in 
critically ill patients with AKI, and RDW is an independent prognostic factor of 
long-term outcomes of these patients.

BACKGROUND: Heart failure (HF) is a common cardiovascular disease, which is 
related to systemic inflammation for decades. Fibrinogen (FIB) is a sign of 
thrombosis and inflammation, which is associated with the prognosis of many 
diseases. Nevertheless, the role of fibrinogen level in the prognosis of 
critically ill patients with acute exacerbation of chronic heart failure is 
unclear.
METHODS: The data are from the Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care III 
(MIMIC III) database, which is a freely accessible critical care database. The 
primary outcome in our study was 90-day mortality. The prognostic value of 
fibrinogen was analyzed with receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve 
analysis, Kaplan-Meier curve, and Cox model.
RESULTS: A total of 554 patients were included. Patients were divided into two 
groups, low fibrinogen level (<284 mg/dl) and high fibrinogen level 
(≥284 mg/dl), through the cut-off value of the ROC curve. The area under the ROC 
curve of fibrinogen for predicting 90-day mortality was 0.65 (95% CI: 
0.59-0.70). In the unadjusted Cox model, compared with the low fibrinogen level 
(<284 mg/dl), the 90-day mortality of the hazard ratio (HR) with 95% confidence 
intervals (CI) of the high fibrinogen level is 3.33 (95% CI 2.15-5.15). In 
different multivariable Cox models, compared with the low fibrinogen level 
(<284 mg/dl), the 90-day mortality of the hazard ratio of the high fibrinogen 
level is from 2.83 to 3.13. In subgroup analyses, significant interactions were 
observed only in age, chronic kidney disease (CKD), and APS III scores.
CONCLUSION: Our data suggest that high fibrinogen levels (≥284 mg/dl) 
independently predict mortality in critically ill patients with acute 
exacerbation of chronic heart failure. Our findings need to be further validated 
by large prospective studies and longer follow-up time.

BACKGROUND: The thrombocytopenia influences prognoses of critically ill 
patients. There are few studies exploring the prognostic value of 
thrombocytopenia among ICH patients. We perform this study to explore the 
correlation between thrombocytopenia at different timepoints of hospitalizations 
and mortality of ICH.
METHODS: ICH patients recorded in the Medical Information Mart for Intensive 
Care-III were selected for this observational study. The thrombocytopenia, 
defined as platelet <150 × 109/L, was divided into three categories: baseline 
thrombocytopenia (thrombocytopenia occurred at admission), acquired 
thrombocytopenia (thrombocytopenia developed since the second day after 
admission), multiple thrombocytopenia (baseline thrombocytopenia + acquired 
thrombocytopenia). The main outcome in this study was the 30-day mortality of 
ICH patients. The univariate and multivariate logistic regression was 
sequentially performed to discover risk factors of mortality and confirm the 
correlation between thrombocytopenia groups and mortality of ICH.
RESULTS: 66.5% of 902 ICH patients did not experience the thrombocytopenia since 
admission. 2.2, 14.5 and 16.7% ICH patients showed the baseline 
thrombocytopenia, acquired thrombocytopenia initial and multiple 
thrombocytopenia, respectively. The GCS did not show significant difference 
between thrombocytopenia groups (p = 0.118). The multiple thrombocytopenia group 
had the highest incidence of mechanical ventilation (p = 0.041), mortality 
(p < 0.001), and the longest length of ICU stay (p < 0.001), length of hospital 
stay (p < 0.001). The multivariate logistic regression found age (p < 0.001), 
GCS (p < 0.001), glucose (p = 0.013), mechanical ventilation (p = 0.002) was 
correlated with the mortality of ICH patients. Only the multiple 
thrombocytopenia group showed significant influence on the mortality of ICH 
(p = 0.002) in the multivariate logistic regression.
CONCLUSION: Single initial thrombocytopenia at admission dose not influence the 
mortality of ICH patients. ICH patients experiencing both initial 
thrombocytopenia and acquired thrombocytopenia have significantly higher 
mortality risk. The blood platelet level of ICH patients should be monitored 
continuously during hospitalizations to detect the thrombocytopenia and identify 
the high risk of poor prognosis.

BACKGROUND: The Albumin-Bilirubin (ALBI) score, recommended for assessing the 
prognosis of hepatocellular carcinoma patients, has garnered attention. The 
efficacy of ALBI score in forecasting the risk of death in sepsis patients 
remains limited. We designed two cohort studies to assess the association 
between ALBI score and in-hospital mortality in patients with sepsis.
METHODS: A retrospective analysis was conducted utilizing data from the Second 
Affiliated Hospital of Guangzhou Medical University and the Medical Information 
Mart for Intensive Care IV(MIMIC-IV). Patients diagnosed with sepsis were 
included in the analysis. The primary outcome was the in-hospital mortality. 
Multivariate Cox regression analysis was conducted to assess the independent 
association between the ALBI score and mortality, with adjustment for potential 
confounders. Subgroup analysis was conducted to assess the robustness of the 
findings.
RESULTS: The Guangzhou Sepsis Cohort (GZSC) of the Second Affiliated Hospital of 
Guangzhou Medical University comprised 2969 participants, while the MIMIC-IV 
database included 8841 participants. The ALBI score were categorized 
into < -2.60, -2.60∼-1.39, and >-1.39. After adjusting for confounders, a linear 
relationship was observed between ALBI score and mortality. Patients with a high 
ALBI grade were associated with higher in-hospital mortality in both the GZSC 
(HR: 1.52, 95%CI: 1.24-1.87, p < 0.001) and the MIMIC-IV database (HR: 1.57, 
95%CI: 1.46-1.70, p < 0.001).
CONCLUSIONS: A high ALBI score is associated with higher in-hospital mortality 
among sepsis patients in ICU.

BACKGROUND This study aimed to investigate the association between 
albumin-corrected anion gap (ACAG) and in-hospital mortality in 
sepsis-associated acute kidney injury (S-AKI). MATERIAL AND METHODS We conducted 
this retrospective study based on data from the Medical Information Mart for 
Intensive Care IV database, and assessed the prognostic capabilities of ACAG in 
comparison with albumin (ALB) and anion gap (AG) to predict in-hospital 
mortality of patients with S-AKI. Binomial logistic regression analysis was 
performed to identify whether ACAG was an independent risk factor for 
in-hospital mortality for the patients, and receiver operating characteristic 
(ROC) curves were plotted to clarify its efficacy in predicting in-hospital 
mortality. We also performed a decision curve analysis (DCA) to determine 
whether there were net clinical benefits for patients when ACAG was used to 
predict in-hospital mortality. RESULTS Binary logistic regression analysis 
showed that ACAG was an independent risk factor for in-hospital mortality in 
patients with S-AKI, with an area under the ROC (AUC) curve of 0.675 (moderate 
predictive value) for the prediction of in-hospital mortality, higher than that 
of ALB or AG alone, with the highest Youden's index (0.2675). The DCA 
substantiated the superiority of ACAG in net clinical benefits at various 
threshold probability, enhancing its clinical applicability. CONCLUSIONS The 
research emphasizes the potential of ACAG as a valuable predictive tool for 
in-hospital mortality in S-AKI patients, which is better than albumin and AG, 
encouraging its consideration in clinical practice.

Background: Human serum albumin (HSA) is a commonly used medication for the 
treatment of sepsis. However, there is no conclusive evidence as to whether 
different concentrations of HSA are associated with patient prognosis. This 
study aimed to evaluate the association between different concentrations of HSA 
and 28-day mortality in patients with sepsis. Methods: The data for this 
retrospective study were collected from the Medical Information Mart for 
Intensive Care IV database. Patients with sepsis were divided into two groups 
according to the concentration of HSA received: 25% and 5% HSA. The primary 
outcome of this study was the 28-day mortality in patients with sepsis. To 
ensure the robustness of our findings, we used multivariate Cox regression, 
propensity score matching, double-robust estimation, and inverse probability 
weighting models. Results: A total of 76,943 patients were screened, of whom 
5,009 were enrolled. 1,258 and 3,751 patients received 25% and 5% HSA, 
respectively. The 28-day mortality rate was 38.2% (481/1,258) for patients in 
the 25% HSA group and 8.7% (325/3,751) for patients in the 5% HSA group. After 
propensity score matching, 1,648 patients were identified. The inverse 
probability weighting model suggested that 5% HSA received was associated with 
lower 28-day mortality (hazard ratio [HR]: 0.63, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 
0.54-0.73, p < 0.001). Subgroup and sensitivity analysis confirmed the 
robustness of the results. Conclusion: In patients with sepsis, 5% HSA received 
may be associated with a lower risk of 28-day mortality than 25% HSA. Further 
randomized controlled trials are required to confirm this association.

Background : While acute myocardial infarction (AMI) is widely recognized as the 
primary cause of cardiogenic shock (CS), non-AMI-related CS has been excluded 
from the majority of CS studies. Information on its prognostic factors remains 
largely understudied, and it is necessary to focus on these patients to identify 
the specific risk factors. In this study, we aimed to build and validate a 
predictive nomogram and risk classification system. Methods: 1298 patients and 
548 patients with CS from the Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care IV and 
III databases were included in the study after excluding patients with AMI. 
Lasso and logistic regression analysis were used to identify statistically 
significant predictors, which were finally involved in the nomogram. The 
predictive performance of the nomogram was validated by calibration plots and 
was compared with other scoring systems by area under curve and decision curve 
analysis curves. Results: Age, heart rate, white blood cell count, albumin 
level, lactic acid level, GCS score, 24-h urine output, and vasopressor use were 
identified as the most critical factors for in-hospital death. Based on these 
results, a nomogram was established for predicting in-hospital mortality. The 
area under curve value of the nomogram was 0.806 in the training group and 0.814 
and 0.730 in the internal and external validation sets, respectively, which were 
significantly higher than those of other commonly used intensive care unit 
scoring systems (Simplified Acute Physiology Score II, Acute Physiology Score 
III, and Sequential Organ Failure Assessment). In addition, the survival curve 
showed significant differences in the 30-day survival of the three risk 
subgroups divided by the nomogram. Conclusion: For non-AMI-associated CS, a 
predictive nomogram and risk classification system were developed and validated, 
and the nomogram demonstrated good performance in prognostic prediction and risk 
stratification.

BACKGROUND: Currently, the clinical evidence regarding the prognostic 
significance of the TyG index in acute myocardial infarction (AMI) patients 
remains unclear. Our research analyzed the correlation between the TyG index and 
the risk of mortality in patients with AMI, in order to evaluate the influence 
of the TyG index on the prognosis of this population.
METHODS: 1205 ICU patients with AMI were analyzed in this retrospective cohort 
analysis, and the necessary data were obtained from the Medical Information Mart 
for Intensive Care IV (MIMIC-IV) database. The study conducted Kaplan-Meier 
analysis to compare all-cause mortality rates across four groups of patients. 
The study included logistic regression and Cox regression analysis to examine 
the correlation among the TyG index and the risk of in-hospital, 28-day, and 
90-day mortality.
RESULTS: In our study, 176 (14.61%) patients experienced in-hospital deaths, 198 
(16.43%) patients died within 28 days of follow-up, and 189 (23.98%) patients 
died within 90 days of follow-up. Logistic regression and Cox proportional 
hazard analyses revealed that the TyG index was an independent predictor of 
in-hospital, 28-day, and 90-day mortality (OR: 1.406, 95% CI 1.141-1.731, p = 
0.001; HR: 1.364, 95% CI 1.118-1.665, p = 0.002; HR: 1.221, 95% CI 1.024-1.445, 
p = 0.026, respectively). The restricted cubic spline regression model showed 
that the risk of in-hospital, 28-day, and 90-day mortality increased linearly 
with increasing TyG index.
CONCLUSIONS: The TyG index was significantly associated with an increased risk 
of mortality in AMI patients. Our findings suggested that the TyG index may be 
instrumental in identifying patients at high risk for adverse outcomes following 
AMI.

BACKGROUND: The duration of hospitalization, especially in the intensive care 
unit (ICU), for patients with diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) is influenced by 
patient prognosis and treatment costs. Reducing ICU length of stay (LOS) in 
patients with DKA is crucial for optimising healthcare resources utilization. 
This study aimed to establish a nomogram prediction model to identify the risk 
factors influencing prolonged LOS in ICU-managed patients with DKA, which will 
serve as a basis for clinical treatment, healthcare safety, and quality 
management research.
METHODS: In this single-centre retrospective cohort study, we performed a 
retrospective analysis using relevant data extracted from the Medical 
Information Mart for Intensive Care IV (MIMIC-IV) database. Clinical data from 
669 patients with DKA requiring ICU treatment were included. Variables were 
selected using the Least Absolute Shrinkage and Selection Operator (LASSO) 
binary logistic regression model. Subsequently, the selected variables were 
subjected to a multifactorial logistic regression analysis to determine 
independent risk factors for prolonged ICU LOS in patients with DKA. A nomogram 
prediction model was constructed based on the identified predictors. The 
multivariate variables included in this nomogram prediction model were the 
Oxford acute severity of illness score (OASIS), Glasgow coma scale (GCS), acute 
kidney injury (AKI) stage, vasoactive agents, and myocardial infarction.
RESULTS: The prediction model had a high predictive efficacy, with an area under 
the curve value of 0.870 (95% confidence interval [CI], 0.831-0.908) in the 
training cohort and 0.858 (95% CI, 0.799-0.916) in the validation cohort. A 
highly accurate predictive model was depicted in both cohorts using the 
Hosmer-Lemeshow (H-L) test and calibration plots.
CONCLUSION: The nomogram prediction model proposed in this study has a high 
clinical application value for predicting prolonged ICU LOS in patients with 
DKA. This model can help clinicians identify patients with DKA at risk of 
prolonged ICU LOS, thereby enhancing prompt intervention and improving 
prognosis.

BACKGROUND: Electrolyte disturbances are prevalent complications in critically 
ill patients with sepsis, significantly impacting patient prognosis. However, 
the specific association between serum potassium levels and mortality risk in 
this population remains poorly understood. This study aimed to investigate the 
association between serum potassium levels during hospitalization and the risk 
of 28-day and 90-day mortality in critically ill patients with sepsis.
METHODS: Data were obtained from the Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care 
(MIMIC-IV) database, and patients with severe sepsis requiring ICU admission 
were stratified into quartiles based on their mean serum potassium levels. 
Outcomes assessed included 28-day and 90-day mortality. A multivariate Cox 
proportional hazards model was used to investigate the association between serum 
potassium levels and mortality, with restricted cubic splines to identify 
potential nonlinear correlations. A dichotomous Cox proportional hazards model 
was applied to analyze the association further, and Kaplan-Meier analysis 
assessed the mortality risk across different potassium ranges.
RESULTS: A total of 25,203 patients were included, with 28-day and 90-day 
mortality rates of 27.84% and 40.48%, respectively. Multivariate analysis showed 
a significant association between serum potassium levels and mortality. 
Restricted cubic splines identified an inflection point at 4.4 mmol/L, with 
potassium levels above this threshold associated with higher mortality (28-day 
mortality: HR 2.96, 95% CI = 2.43-3.60; 90-day mortality: HR 2.19, 95% CI = 
1.81-2.64). Kaplan-Meier analysis confirmed a significantly higher risk of death 
for patients with serum potassium levels above 4.4 mmol/L compared to those 
within the 3.5-4.4 mmol/L range (P<0.001).
CONCLUSION: In critically ill patients with sepsis, serum potassium levels 
exceeding 4.4 mmol/L are associated with an increased risk of death. Maintaining 
the average serum potassium level within the range of 3.5-4.4 mmol/L appears to 
be safe and may contribute to better outcomes in this patient population.

BACKGROUND: This study aimed to evaluate the role of platelet count (PLT) in the 
prognosis of patients with acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS).
METHODS: The data were extracted from the Medical Information Mart for Intensive 
Care database (version 2.2). Patients diagnosed with ARDS according to criteria 
from Berlin Definition and had the platelet count (PLT) measured within the 
first day after intensive care unit admission were analyzed. Based on PLT, ARDS 
patients were divided into four groups: PLT ≤ 100 × 109/L, PLT 101-200 × 109/L, 
PLT 201-300 × 109/L, and PLT > 300 × 109/L. The primary outcome was 28-day 
mortality. Survival probabilities were analyzed using Kaplan-Meier. Furthermore, 
the association between PLT and mortality in ARDS patients was assessed using a 
univariate and multivariable Cox proportional hazards model.
RESULTS: Overall, the final analysis included 3,207 eligible participants with 
ARDS. According to the Kaplan-Meier curves for 28-day mortality of PLT, 
PLT ≤ 100 × 109/L was associated with a higher incidence of mortality 
(P = 0.001), the same trends were observed in the 60-day (P = 0.001) and 90-day 
mortality (P = 0.001). In the multivariate model adjusted for the potential 
factors, the adjusted hazard ratio at PLT 101-200 × 109/L group, PLT 
201-300 × 109/L, and PLT > 300 × 109/L was 0.681 [95% confidence interval (CI): 
0.576-0.805, P < 0.001], 0.733 (95% CI: 0.604-0.889, P = 0.002), and 0.787 (95% 
CI: 0.624-0.994, P = 0.044) compared to the reference group (PLT ≤ 100 × 109/L), 
respectively. Similar relationships between the PLT ≤ 100 × 109/L group and 
28-day mortality were obtained in most subgroups.
CONCLUSION: PLT appeared to be an independent predictor of mortality in 
critically ill patients with ARDS.

PURPOSE: To identify phenotypes of Intensive Care Unit (ICU) onset sepsis and 
its associated harms of delayed time-to-antibiotics.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: The Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care IV 
(MIMIC-IV) database was employed to identify patients with ICU onset sepsis. The 
primary exposure was time-to-antibiotics, as measured from sepsis recognition to 
first antibiotic administered. Latent profile analysis (LPA) was used to 
identify phenotypes of sepsis based on individual organ failure score derived 
from Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (SOFA). Interactions between phenotypes 
and time-to-antibiotics on 28-day mortality were explored.
RESULTS: 6246 patients were enrolled in final analysis. The overall 28-day 
mortality was 12.7%. Delayed time-to-antibiotics was associated with increased 
28-day mortality in patients with ICU onset sepsis (HR 1.12, 95% CI 1.08-1.18). 
Four phenotypes of sepsis were identified: phenotype 1 was characterized by 
respiratory dysfunction, phenotype 2 was characterized by cardiovascular 
dysfunction, phenotype 3 was characterized by multiple organ dysfunction, and 
phenotype 4 was characterized by neurological dysfunction. The adjusted HR of 
28-day mortality was 1.16 (95% CI 1.08-1.25) in phenotype 1, and 1.06 (95% CI 
1.00-1.13) in phenotype 2, while no significant interaction was observed.
CONCLUSIONS: Septic patients with respiratory or cardiovascular dysfunction were 
associated with harms of delayed time-to-antibiotics.

BACKGROUND: The ratio of red blood cell distribution width (RDW) to albumin 
(ALB), known as RAR, functions as an innovative indicator related to prognosis. 
However, whether RAR can predict the in-hospital mortality (IHM) for heart 
failure (HF) patients remains ambiguous.
METHODS: This study included HF patients derived from the Medical Information 
Mart for Intensive Care III (MIMIC-III) and IV (MIMIC-IV) databases. To examine 
the association between RAR and IHM, multiple Logistic regression models were 
conducted, complemented by subgroup analyses. Additionally, to ascertain the 
optimal threshold for RAR, restricted cubic spline (RCS) regressions were 
applied.
RESULTS: In the MIMIC-III (n = 9,413) and MIMIC-IV (n = 18,685) HF cohorts, the 
incidence of IHM was observed in 1,639 (17.41%) and 1,175 (6.29%) participants. 
Following adjustment for various covariates, RAR was shown to correlate with IHM 
(OR, 1.45 [95% CI, 1.08-1.39]). The areas under the curves for RAR were 0.683 
(MIMIC-III) and 0.710 (MIMIC-IV), indicating superior predictive value than RDW 
and ALB. In subgroup analysis, younger HF patients with diabetes and without 
atrial fibrillation or anaemia showed higher ORs than older patients without 
diabetes or atrial fibrillation and those with anaemia, respectively. RCS 
indicated the OR for RAR was non-linear with IHM, and the optimal threshold for 
RAR prediction was between 4.5 and 5.
CONCLUSION: An elevated RAR correlates with an increased risk of IHM in HF 
patients. Given that RAR can be readily derived from routine laboratory tests, 
it holds potential as a novel biomarker for identifying high-risk HF patients.

OBJECTIVE: To investigate the predictive value of the blood urea nitrogen to 
serum albumin ratio for in-hospital and out-of-hospital mortality in critically 
ill patients with diabetic ketoacidosis.
METHODS: Data were obtained from the Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care 
III (MIMIC III) database, and all eligible participants were categorized into 
two groups based on the BAR cutoff value. Multiple logistic regression analysis 
was conducted to determine the association between BAR and in-hospital 
mortality. The Kaplan-Meier (K-M) analysis was performed to evaluate the 
predictive performance of BAR. Propensity score matching (PSM) was applied to 
control confounding factors between the low and high BAR groups.
RESULTS: A total of 589 critically ill patients with diabetic ketoacidosis were 
enrolled. Patients with diabetic ketoacidosis with a higher BAR level were 
associated with higher in- and out-hospital mortality (all p<0.001). A 
significant 4-year survival difference was observed between the low and high BAR 
groups (p<0.0001). After PSM analysis, two PSM groups (202 pairs, n=404) were 
generated, and similar results were observed in the K-M curve (p<0.0001).
DISCUSSION: Elevated BAR levels were associated with an increased risk of 
in-hospital mortality in critically ill patients with diabetic ketoacidosis, and 
BAR could serve as an independent prognostic factor in in-hospital and 
out-of-hospital mortality for patients diagnosed with diabetic ketoacidosis.

Introduction: Septic patients with atrial fibrillation (AF) are common in the 
intensive care unit accompanied by high mortality. The early prediction of 
prognosis of these patients is critical for clinical intervention. This study 
aimed to develop a model by using machine learning (ML) algorithms to predict 
the risk of 28-day mortality in septic patients with AF. Methods: In this 
retrospective cohort study, we extracted septic patients with AF from the 
Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care III (MIMIC-III) and IV database. 
Afterward, only MIMIC-IV cohort was randomly divided into training or internal 
validation set. External validation set was mainly extracted from MIMIC-III 
database. Propensity score matching was used to reduce the imbalance between the 
external validation and internal validation data sets. The predictive factors 
for 28-day mortality were determined by using multivariate logistic regression. 
Then, we constructed models by using ML algorithms. Multiple metrics were used 
for evaluation of performance of the models, including the area under the 
receiver operating characteristic curve, sensitivity, specificity, recall, and 
accuracy. Results: A total of 5,317 septic patients with AF were enrolled, with 
3,845 in the training set, 960 in the internal testing set, and 512 in the 
external testing set, respectively. Then, we established four prediction models 
by using ML algorithms. AdaBoost showed moderate performance and had a higher 
accuracy than the other three models. Compared with other severity scores, the 
AdaBoost obtained more net benefit. Conclusion: We established the first ML 
model for predicting the 28-day mortality of septic patients with AF. Compared 
with conventional scoring systems, the AdaBoost model performed moderately. The 
model established will have the potential to improve the level of clinical 
practice.

OBJECTIVES: The objective of the study was to assess the clinical predictive 
value of the dynamics of absolute lymphocyte count (ALC) for 90-day all-cause 
mortality in sepsis patients in intensive care unit (ICU).
DESIGN: Retrospective cohort study using big data.
SETTING: This study was conducted using the Medical Information Mart for 
Intensive Care IV database V.2.0 database.
PRIMARY AND SECONDARY OUTCOME MEASURES: The primary outcome was 90-day all-cause 
mortality.
PARTICIPANTS: Patients were included if they were diagnosed with sepsis on the 
first day of ICU admission. Exclusion criteria were ICU stay under 24 hours; the 
absence of lymphocyte count on the first day; extremely high lymphocyte count 
(>10×109/L); history of haematolymphatic tumours, bone marrow or solid organ 
transplants; survival time under 72 hours and previous ICU admissions. The 
analysis ultimately included 17 329 sepsis patients.
RESULTS: The ALC in the non-survivors group was lower on days 1, 3, 5 and 7 
after admission (p<0.001). The ALC on day 7 had the highest area under the curve 
(AUC) value for predicting 90-day mortality. The cut-off value of ALC on day 7 
was 1.0×109/L. In the restricted cubic spline plot, after multivariate 
adjustments, patients with higher lymphocyte counts had a better prognosis. 
After correction, in the subgroups with Sequential Organ Failure Assessment 
score ≥6 or age ≥60 years, ALC on day 7 had the lowest HR value (0.79 and 0.81, 
respectively). On the training and testing set, adding the ALC on day 7 improved 
all prediction models' AUC and average precision values.
CONCLUSIONS: Dynamic changes of ALC are closely associated with 90-day all-cause 
mortality in sepsis patients. Furthermore, the ALC on day 7 after admission is a 
better independent predictor of 90-day mortality in sepsis patients, especially 
in severely ill or young sepsis patients.

Background: Serum calcium levels disorder have been reported to be associated 
with poor prognosis in different diseases. Studies on the association between 
serum calcium and outcomes of septic patients remained limited. The aim of this 
study is to investigate the association between serum calcium and 28-day 
mortality in septic patients. Method: Patients diagnosed with sepsis in the 
Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care III database were included. Patients 
were divided into five groups according to the quintiles of serum calcium 
levels, and their baseline characteristics were compared. Multivariate Cox 
regression models were used to assess the association between serum calcium and 
28-day mortality. Smooth curve fitting and segmented regression models were used 
to visualize the association between serum calcium levels and 28-day mortality 
risk. The 28-day survival probability between five groups was analyzed using 
Kaplan-Meier curves. Results: A total of 3,016 patients with sepsis were 
enrolled, and the 28-day mortality rate was 35.64%. After adjusting for 
confounders, compared with the reference quintile (Q4: 9.00-9.50), the lowest 
serum calcium level quintile (Q1: 5.70-8.20) was independently associated with 
an increased risk of 28-day mortality (hazard ratio [HR], 2.12; 95% CI, 
1.76-2.56). Smooth spline fitting revealed a U-shaped association between serum 
calcium and 28-day mortality. When serum calcium was <9.0 mg/dL, 28-day 
mortality risk increased by 58% per unit decrease in serum calcium (HR, 0.42; 
95% CI, 0.37-0.48). When serum calcium was >9.0 mg/dL, the 28-day mortality risk 
increased by 12% per unit increase in serum calcium (HR, 1.12; 95% CI, 
1.04-1.20). Conclusion: A U-shaped association was observed between serum 
calcium levels and 28-day mortality in septic patients. Lower or higher serum 
calcium levels were associated with increased risk of 28-day mortality in septic 
patients.

BACKGROUND: In recent years, the number of elderly patients undergoing cardiac 
surgery has rapidly increased and is associated with poor outcomes. However, 
there is still a lack of adequate models for predicting the risk of death after 
cardiac surgery in elderly patients. This study sought to identify independent 
risk factors for 1-year all-cause mortality in elderly patients after cardiac 
surgery and to develop a predictive model.
METHODS: A total of 3,752 elderly patients with cardiac surgery were enrolled 
from the Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care III (MIMIC-III) dataset and 
randomly divided into training and validation sets. The primary outcome was the 
all-cause mortality at 1 year. The Least absolute shrinkage and selection 
operator (LASSO) regression was used to decrease data dimensionality and select 
features. Multivariate logistic regression was used to establish the prediction 
model. The concordance index (C-index), receiver operating characteristic curve 
(ROC), and decision curve analysis (DCA) were used to measure the predictive 
performance of the nomogram.
RESULTS: Our results demonstrated that age, sex, Sequential Organ Failure 
Assessment (SOFA), respiratory rate (RR), creatinine, glucose, and RBC 
transfusion (red blood cell) were independent factors for elderly patient 
mortality after cardiac surgery. The C-index of the training and validation sets 
was 0.744 (95%CI: 0.707-0.781) and 0.751 (95%CI: 0.709-0.794), respectively. The 
area under the curve (AUC) and decision curve analysis (DCA) results 
substantiated that the nomogram yielded an excellent performance predicting the 
1-year all-cause mortality after cardiac surgery.
CONCLUSIONS: We developed a novel nomogram model for predicting the 1-year 
all-cause mortality for elderly patients after cardiac surgery, which could be 
an effective and useful clinical tool for clinicians for tailored therapy and 
prognosis prediction.

INTRODUCTION: Acute ischemic stroke (AIS) patients admitted to the intensive 
care unit (ICU) have a high mortality rate, necessitating the early 
identification of those at risk of a poor prognosis. This study investigated the 
association between the blood glucose-to-potassium ratio (GPR) and the prognosis 
of AIS patients.
METHODS: We conducted a retrospective cohort study using data from the Medical 
Information Mart for Intensive Care IV (MIMIC-IV) database. The primary outcomes 
were 28-day, 90-day, and 1-year mortality rates following ICU admission. 
Multivariate Cox proportional hazards regression models were used to estimate 
adjusted hazard ratios (HRs) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs). Subgroup 
analyses, Kaplan-Meier survival curves, and restricted cubic spline models were 
employed to further evaluate the relationship between the GPR and mortality in 
AIS patients.
RESULTS: A total of 2,636 AIS patients were included in the study, with a mean 
age of 69.4 ± 15.6 years. The 1-year mortality rate was 36.8% (n = 969). After 
adjusting for confounders, compared with the first quartile (Q1, GPR ≤ 1.39), 
the 1-year mortality risks for the second quartile (Q2, 1.39 < GPR ≤ 1.74), 
third quartile (Q3, 1.74 < GPR ≤ 2.25), and fourth quartile (Q4, GPR ≥ 2.25) 
were HR = 1.17 (95% CI: 0.95-1.43, p = 0.132), HR = 1.42 (95% CI: 1.17-1.73, p < 
0.001), and HR = 1.61 (95% CI: 1.33-1.96, p < 0.001), respectively. Similar 
trends were observed for 28-day and 90-day mortality. Kaplan-Meier (KM) analysis 
revealed that groups with higher GPRs had higher mortality rates at 28 days, 90 
days, and 1 year. Non-linear analysis further confirmed the presence of an 
inflection point in the association between the GPR and 365-day mortality, which 
was identified at GPR = 2.75. At ratios less than this threshold, the risk of 
mortality increased significantly with increasing GPR (HR: 1.466; 95% CI: 
1.239-1.735; p < 0.001). However, above this ratio, the association plateaued 
and was no longer statistically significant (HR: 0.899; 95% CI: 0.726-1.113; p = 
0.095).
CONCLUSION: The GPR is an independent predictor of poor prognosis in AIS 
patients admitted to the ICU. Higher GPRs are associated with increased 28-day 
and 90-day mortality rates, highlighting the potential utility of this ratio in 
risk stratification and clinical decision-making. A non-linear relationship was 
observed between the GPR and 365-day mortality, with an inflection point 
identified at GPR = 2.75.

BACKGROUND: Urinary tract infection (UTI) is a common cause of sepsis. Elderly 
patients with urosepsis in intensive care unit (ICU) have more severe conditions 
and higher mortality rates owing to factors such as advanced age, 
immunosenescence, and persistent host inflammatory responses. However, 
comprehensive studies on nomograms to predict the in-hospital mortality risk in 
elderly patients with urosepsis are lacking. This study aimed to construct a 
nomogram predictive model to accurately assess the prognosis of elderly patients 
with urosepsis and provide therapeutic recommendations.
METHODS: Data of elderly patients with urosepsis were extracted from the Medical 
Information Mart for Intensive Care (MIMIC) IV 2.2 database. Patients were 
randomly divided into training and validation cohorts. A predictive nomogram 
model was constructed from the training set using logistic regression analysis, 
followed by internal validation and sensitivity analysis.
RESULTS: This study included 1,251 patients. LASSO regression analysis revealed 
that the Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) score, red cell distribution width (RDW), 
white blood count (WBC), and invasive ventilation were independent risk factors 
identified from a total of 43 variables studied. We then created and verified a 
nomogram. The area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC), net 
reclassification improvement (NRI), integrated discrimination improvement (IDI), 
and decision curve analysis (DCA) of the nomogram were superior to those of the 
traditional SAPS-II, APACHE-II, and SOFA scoring systems. The Hosmer-Lemeshow 
test results and calibration curves suggested good nomogram calibration. The IDI 
and NRI values showed that our nomogram scoring tool performed better than the 
other scoring systems. The DCA curves showed good clinical applicability of the 
nomogram.
CONCLUSIONS: The nomogram constructed in this study is a convenient tool for 
accurately predicting in-hospital mortality in elderly patients with urosepsis 
in ICU. Improving the treatment strategies for factors related to the model 
could improve the in-hospital survival rates of these patients.

Objective: Our study aims to evaluate the association between heart rate 
variability (HRV) and short- and long-term prognosis in patients admitted to 
intensive care unit (ICU). Methods and Results: Adult patients continuously 
monitored for over 24 h in ICUs from the the American Medical Information Mart 
for Intensive Care (MIMIC)-IV Waveform Database were recruited in our study. 
Twenty HRV-related variables (8 time domain, 6 frequency domain, and 6 nonlinear 
variables) were calculated based on RR intervals. The association between HRV 
and all-cause mortality was assessed. Ninety-three patients met the inclusion 
criteria and were classified into atrial fibrillation (AF) and sinus rhythm (SR) 
groups, which were further divided into 30-day survivor group and 
nonsurvivor\groups based on their survival status. The 30-day all-cause 
mortality rates in AF and SR groups were 36.3% and 14.6%, respectively. All the 
time domain, frequency domain, and nonlinear HRV parameters did not differ 
significantly between survivors and nonsurvivors with or without AF (all P > 
0.05). Presence of renal failure, malignancy, and elevated blood urea nitrogen 
level were associated with increased 30-day all-cause mortality in SR patients, 
while presence of sepsis, infection, higher platelet count, and magnesium level 
were associated with increased 30-day all-cause mortality in AF patients. 
Conclusions: Heart rate variability variables were not associated with increased 
30-day all-cause mortality in ICU patients with or without AF.

OBJECTIVES: The neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio is gaining popularity as a 
low-cost biomarker of inflammation and outcome prediction. Intracerebral 
hemorrhage has high mortality and disability, which strongly influences societal 
development. This study aimed to research whether the neutrophil-to-lymphocyte 
ratio can predict hospital mortality in patients with severe intracerebral 
hemorrhage.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: It was a retrospective analysis of prospectively 
collected data. The survival analysis and proportional hazards models analyzed 
clinical data from the Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care III database 
of patients with intracerebral hemorrhage.
RESULTS: The records of 1,000 patients were included in our study. Two hundred 
forty-seven individuals died in the hospital, while 753 survived to discharge. 
According to data analysis, the neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio of the death 
group (11.21±7.81) significantly exceeded the survival group (7.94±6.04). The 
univariate Cox regression revealed that the neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio is a 
potential predictor of in-hospital mortality (HR:1.044; 95% CI:1.029-1.059; p 
<0.001). Furthermore, the proportional hazards model demonstrated that the risk 
of in-hospital death increased 2.34-fold for each increase in 
neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio when other factors were held constant. Following 
the ROC analysis, the Kaplan-Meier based on the proportional hazards model 
showed that patients with a neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio >7.68 on the first 
day of hospitalization had a higher risk of death.
CONCLUSIONS: In patients with severe intracerebral hemorrhage, the 
neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio is a potential predictor of in-hospital 
mortality.

BACKGROUND: Invasive mechanical ventilation plays an important role in the 
prognosis of patients with sepsis. However, there are, currently, no tools 
specifically designed to assess weaning from invasive mechanical ventilation in 
patients with sepsis. The aim of our study was to develop a practical model to 
predict weaning in patients with sepsis.
METHODS: We extracted patient information from the Medical Information Mart for 
Intensive Care Database-IV (MIMIC-IV) and the eICU Collaborative Research 
Database (eICU-CRD). Kaplan-Meier curves were plotted to compare the 28-day 
mortality between patients who successfully weaned and those who failed to wean. 
Subsequently, MIMIC-IV was divided into a training set and an internal 
verification set, and the eICU-CRD was designated as the external verification 
set. We selected the best model to simplify the internal and external validation 
sets based on the performance of the model.
RESULTS: A total of 5020 and 7081 sepsis patients with invasive mechanical 
ventilation in MIMIC-IV and eICU-CRD were included, respectively. After 
matching, weaning was independently associated with 28-day mortality and length 
of ICU stay (p < 0.001 and p = 0.002, respectively). After comparison, 35 
clinical variables were extracted to build weaning models. XGBoost performed the 
best discrimination among the models in the internal and external validation 
sets (AUROC: 0.80 and 0.86, respectively). Finally, a simplified model was 
developed based on XGBoost, which included only four variables. The simplified 
model also had good predictive performance (AUROC:0.75 and 0.78 in internal and 
external validation sets, respectively) and was developed into a web-based tool 
for further review.
CONCLUSIONS: Weaning success is independently related to short-term mortality in 
patients with sepsis. The simplified model based on the XGBoost algorithm 
provides good predictive performance and great clinical applicablity for 
weaning, and a web-based tool was developed for better clinical application.

AIMS: This study aimed to establish a phenotypic clustering model for critically 
ill patients with comorbid type 2 diabetes mellitus (CIP T2DM), define distinct 
subtypes, and analyze differences in clinical characteristics and treatment 
response.
METHODS: Patients from the Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care IV 
(MIMIC-IV) database were phenotyped based on demographic, physiological, and 
biochemical parameters, along with critically ill scores, using a consensus 
clustering algorithm. Subtype validity was assessed using the eICU Collaborative 
Research Database (eICU). High-frequency combination drug regimens were then 
extracted to reveal therapeutic heterogeneity among subtypes.
RESULTS: Three subtypes were identified in the MIMIC-IV cohort (n = 6349). The 
in-group proportions of 0.957, 0.898, and 0.836 in the eICU cohort (n = 1425) 
show high consistency. These three subtypes are: a) CIP T2DM with severe 
infection (CIP T2DM-SI) with a mortality of 16.7 % and a post-medication blood 
glucose (PMBG, first measured 24 h after medication administration) of 8.25 
mmol/L; b) CIP T2DM with organ failure (CIP T2DM-OF) with 18.6 % mortality and 
8.03 mmol/L PMBG; and c) CIP T2DM under monitoring for continuous observation 
and evaluation (CIP T2DM-UM) with 8.87 % mortality and 6.98 mmol/L PMBG. 
Moreover, the three subtypes showed different in-hospital mortality risks under 
the same medication regimen.
CONCLUSIONS: Three phenotypes were identified in CIP T2DM, showing significant 
heterogeneity in clinical characteristics and prognosis. Personalized 
interventions for these subtypes may help reduce adverse events and guide 
precise treatment in practice.

BACKGROUND: Sepsis is a life-threatening syndrome eliciting highly heterogeneous 
host responses. Current prognostic evaluation methods used in clinical practice 
are characterized by an inadequate effectiveness in predicting sepsis mortality. 
Rapid identification of patients with high mortality risk is urgently needed. 
The phenotyping of patients will assistant invaluably in tailoring treatments.
METHODS: Machine learning and deep learning technology are used to characterize 
the patients' phenotype and determine the sepsis severity. The database used in 
this study is MIMIC-III and MIMIC-IV ('Medical information Mart for intensive 
care') which is a large, public, and freely available database. The K-means 
clustering is used to classify the sepsis phenotype. Convolutional neural 
network (CNN) was used to predict the 28-day survival rate based on 35 blood 
test variables of the sepsis patients, whereas a double coefficient quadratic 
multivariate fitting function (DCQMFF) is utilized to predict the 28-day 
survival rate with only 11 features of sepsis patients.
RESULTS: The patients were grouped into four clusters with a clear survival 
nomogram. The first cluster (C_1) was characterized by low white blood cell 
count, low neutrophil, and the highest lymphocyte proportion. C_2 obtained the 
lowest Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (SOFA) score and the highest survival 
rate. C_3 was characterized by significantly prolonged PTT, high SIC, and a 
higher proportion of patients using heparin than the patients in other clusters. 
The early mortality rate of patients in C_3 was high but with a better long-term 
survival rate than that in C_4. C_4 contained septic coagulation patients with 
the worst prognosis, characterized by slightly prolonged partial thromboplastin 
time (PTT), significantly prolonged prothrombin time (PT), and high septic 
coagulation disease score (SIC). The survival rate prediction accuracy of CNN 
and DCQMFF models reached 92% and 82%, respectively. The models were tested on 
an external dataset (MIMIC-IV) and achieved good performance. A DCQMFF-based 
application platform was established for fast prediction of the 28-day survival 
rate.
CONCLUSION: CNN and DCQMFF accurately predicted the sepsis patients' survival, 
while K-means successfully identified the phenotype groups. The distinct 
phenotypes associated with survival, and significant features correlated with 
mortality were identified. The findings suggest that sepsis patients with 
abnormal coagulation had poor outcomes, abnormal coagulation increase mortality 
during sepsis. The anticoagulation effects of appropriate heparin sodium 
treatment may improve extensive micro thrombosis-caused organ failure.

The role of inflammation and the correlation between inflammatory markers and 
type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) and chronic kidney disease (CKD) have been 
studied. In clinical work, a large number of T2DM patients complicated with CKD, 
but the cause of CKD was not clear. Our study aimed to evaluate the relationship 
between monocyte-to-lymphocyte ratio (MLR) and mortality in T2DM patients with 
CKD. The data from Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care III was analyzed. 
The primary outcome was 90-day all-cause mortality; the secondary outcomes were 
the length of ICU stay, hospital mortality and 30-day all-cause mortality. Cox 
regression was used to evaluate the association between MLR and 90-day 
mortality. We performed subgroup analyses to determine the consistency of this 
association, and used Kaplan-Meier survival curve to analysis the survival of 
different levels of MLR. A total of 1830 patients were included in study 
retrospectively. The length of ICU stay, 30-day all-cause mortality, and 90-day 
all-cause mortality in the MLR > 0.71 group were significantly higher than those 
in the MLR < 0.28 and 0.28 ≤ MLR ≤ 0.71 group. In Cox regression analysis, high 
MLR level was significantly associated with increased greater risk of 90-day 
all-cause mortality. The adjusted HR (95%CIs) for the model 1, model 2, and 
model 3 were 2.429 (1.905-3.098), 2.070 (1.619-2.647), and 1.898 (1.478-2.437), 
respectively. Subgroup analyses also showed the consistency of association 
between MLR and 90-day all-cause mortality. The Kaplan-Meier survival curve 
analysis revealed that MLR > 0.71 had worst prognosis. In T2DM patients with CKD 
in the intensive care unit, high MLR was significantly associated with increased 
risk 90-day all-cause mortality.

BACKGROUND: The prevalence of persistent inflammation, immunosuppression, and 
catabolism syndrome (PICS) has an upward trend in sepsis patients and can be 
associated with poor outcomes. Thyroid hormones are expected to be correlated 
with inflammation, immunity, and metabolism. Thus, the purpose of this study was 
to evaluate the effect of thyroid hormones on the occurrence of PICS and then 
further explore the optimal level of them in sepsis.
METHODS: This retrospective observational study used the online database Medical 
Information Mart for Intensive Care (MIMIC)-IV. Univariate and multivariate 
logistic regression analyses were employed to determine correlations between 
thyroid hormone levels and PICS. A combination of independent PICS development 
factors was established with accuracy assessed using the area under the receiver 
operating characteristic curve (AUC-ROC).
RESULTS: Patients were divided into PICS (n=205) and non-PICS (n=671) groups. 
The third quartiles of triiodothyronine (T3) (60-80ng/dl) and thyroxine (T4) 
(5.5-6.8ug/dl) had the lowest PICS incidence and the adjusted odds ratio (OR) 
was 0.33 (T3, p=0.009) and 0.39 (T4, p=0.006), respectively, compared with the 
first quartiles of T3 and T4. For patients with a pre-existing T3 deficiency, 
severe deficiency (T3 <60ng/dl) and a high Sequential Organ Failure Assessment 
(SOFA) score were significantly related to PICS incidence. The AUC for these 
combined parameters in predicting PICS occurrence was 0.748 (all patients) and 
0.861 (patients without thyroid disease).
CONCLUSIONS: A mild T3 deficiency (60-80ng/dl) was significantly associated with 
the lowest risk-adjusted PICS occurrence in patients with sepsis. A severe T3 
deficiency (<60ng/dl) and a high SOFA score were independent risk factors for 
PICS occurrence.

BACKGROUND: The association between the total bilirubin/albumin (B/A) and the 
all-cause mortality of critically ill patients with acute kidney injury (AKI) 
remains unclear. This retrospective study aimed to investigate the relationship 
between B/A ratio and mortality in patients with AKI.
METHODS: The clinical data of AKI patients in the Medical Information Mart for 
Intensive Care III (MIMIC-III) database were retrospectively analyzed. Patients 
were divided into the low and high B/A groups (B/A ≤ 0.25 and B/A > 0.25, 
respectively). The primary outcome was 28-day all-cause mortality, and the 
secondary outcomes were 60-day, 1-year and 4-year all-cause mortality. 
Kaplan-Meier survival curves and Cox proportional risk models were constructed 
to evaluate the effect of B/A on survival outcomes.
RESULTS: The 28-day mortality rates were 18.00% and 25.10% in the low and high 
B/A groups, respectively (P < 0.001). The Kaplan-Meier analysis showed that 
patients with higher B/A values had higher all-cause mortality risk (log-rank P 
< 0.0001). The multivariate Cox proportional risk analysis showed that B/A was 
an independent risk predictor for death at 28 days, 60 days, 1 year, and 4 
years.
CONCLUSION: B/A is an independent risk factor for increased mortality in 
patients with AKI and may be used as a predictor of clinical outcomes in AKI.

BACKGROUND: Heart failure (HF) is a life-threatening complication of 
cardiovascular disease. HF patients are more likely to progress to acute kidney 
injury (AKI) with a poor prognosis. However, it is difficult for doctors to 
distinguish which patients will develop AKI accurately. This study aimed to 
construct a machine learning (ML) model to predict AKI occurrence in HF 
patients.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: The data of HF patients from the Medical Information Mart 
for Intensive Care-IV (MIMIC-IV) database was retrospectively analyzed. A ML 
model was established to predict AKI development using decision tree, random 
forest (RF), support vector machine (SVM), K-nearest neighbor (KNN), and 
logistic regression (LR) algorithms. Thirty-nine demographic, clinical, and 
treatment features were used for model establishment. Accuracy, sensitivity, 
specificity, and the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve 
(AUROC) were used to evaluate the performance of the ML algorithms.
RESULTS: A total of 2,678 HF patients were engaged in this study, of whom 919 
developed AKI. Among 5 ML algorithms, the RF algorithm exhibited the highest 
performance with the AUROC of 0.96. In addition, the Gini index showed that the 
sequential organ function assessment (SOFA) score, partial pressure of oxygen 
(PaO2), and estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) were highly relevant to 
AKI development. Finally, to facilitate clinical application, a simple model was 
constructed using the 10 features screened by the Gini index. The RF algorithm 
also exhibited the highest performance with the AUROC of 0.95.
CONCLUSION: Using the ML model could accurately predict the development of AKI 
in HF patients.

Sepsis related acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) is a common and 
serious disease in clinic. Accurate prediction of in-hospital mortality of 
patients is crucial to optimize treatment and improve prognosis under the new 
global definition of ARDS. Our study aimed to use machine learning models to 
develop models that can effectively predict the in-hospital mortality of 
patients with sepsis related ARDS, calculate the mortality, and to identify 
related risk factors under the new global definition of ARDS. Based on MIMIC 
database, our study included 3470 first-time admission records of patients with 
sepsis related ARDS. After excluding 4 patients under the age of 18, 75 patients 
with less than 24 h stay in ICU, and 5 cases with missing indicators > 30%, 
finally 3386 cases were retained. The variance inflation factor (VIF) analysis 
was used to test the collinearity of the explanatory variables. The data were 
divided into the training set and the test set according to the ratio of 7:3. 
Six models, extreme gradient boosting (XGBoost), light gradient boosting 
(LightGBM), random forest (RF), classification and regression tree (CART), naive 
bayes (NB) and logistic regression (LR), were designed for training and testing. 
In the training set, XGBoost (AUROC = 0.951, 95% CI 0.942-0.961), LR 
(AUROC = 0.835, 95% CI 0.817-0.854), RF (AUROC = 1.0, 95% CI 1.0-1.0), LightGBM 
(AUROC = 1.0, 95% CI 1.0-1.0), CART (AUROC = 0.831, 95% CI 0.811-0.852), NB 
(AUROC = 0.793, 95% CI 0.772-0.814). In the test set, XGBoost (AUROC = 0.833, 
95% CI 0.804-0.861), LR (AUROC = 0.82695% CI 0.796-0.856), RF (AUROC = 0.846, 
95% CI 0.818-0.874), LightGBM (AUROC = 0.827, 95% CI 0.798-0.856), CART 
(AUROC = 0.753, 95% CI 0.718-0.787), NB (AUROC = 0.799, 95% CI 0.768-0.831). The 
RF model has the best performance on the test set. Further analyze the feature 
importance ranking and partial dependence plots of random forest model. Acute 
physiology and chronic health evaluation III (APACHE III), bicarbonate, anion 
gap and non-invasive blood pressure systolic were identified as the four most 
important risk characteristics. In this study, a variety of machine learning 
models have been successfully constructed to predict the in-hospital mortality 
of patients with sepsis related ARDS, among which the RF model performs well. 
Key risk factors identified include APACHE III, bicarbonate, anion gap and 
non-invasive blood pressure systolic. The identification of these factors helps 
clinicians to assess patients' conditions more accurately and develop 
personalized treatment plans, thereby improving the survival rate and prognosis 
quality of patients under the new global definition of ARDS.

OBJECTIVE: To investigate the association between early blood pressure drop and 
worsening renal function (WRF) in ICU patients with liver failure and to 
evaluate their clinical outcomes.
DESIGN: Retrospective observational study.
SETTING: Intensive Care Medicine.
PATIENTS: Patients admitted to the ICU for the first time during their first 
hospitalization; diagnosed with liver failure according to the International 
Classification of Diseases, Ninth and Tenth Revision codes; and aged ≥18 years 
were included. Patients with a peak systolic blood pressure (SBP) drop of 
<0 mmHg were excluded.
INTERVENTION: We analyzed data of ICU patients with liver failure from the 
Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care IV version 2.2 database. Descriptive 
statistics, analysis of variance, Kruskal-Wallis test, and chi-square test were 
employed for analysis. Multivariate linear regression models were used to assess 
the determinants of blood pressure decline. Cox proportional hazards and 
generalized additive models were used to evaluate MAIN VARIABLES OF INTEREST: 
The relationship between blood pressure decline, WRF, and 60-day in-hospital 
mortality were evaluated, along with subgroup analyses.
RESULTS: Peak SBP drop was independently associated with higher risks of WRF 
(P < 0.001) and 60-day in-hospital mortality (P < 0.001), even after adjusting 
for potential confounders, including baseline SBP. The independent risk 
relationship observed between peak diastolic blood pressure, mean arterial 
pressure drop, and the occurrence of WRF and 60-day in-hospital mortality was 
similar.
CONCLUSIONS: In ICU patients with liver failure, a significant early drop in 
blood pressure was associated with a higher incidence of WRF, increased risk of 
60-day in-hospital mortality, and poorer prognoses.

The study aims to develop and validate a predictive model for effectively 
predicting in-hospital mortality in patients admitted to the intensive care unit 
due to Gastrointestinal bleeding (GIB). A retrospective cohort study was 
conducted, including data from patients in the Electronic Intensive Care Unit 
Collaborative Research Database (eICU-CRD) and Medical Information Mart for 
Intensive Care-IV Database (MIMIC-IV) with a diagnosis of GIB. Patients from the 
eICU-CRD were randomly allocated into both development and validation sets, and 
those from MIMIC-IV were assigned as an external validation group. Multivariate 
logistic regression was employed to create a predictive model, which was 
depicted as a nomogram. This study included a total of 2929 patients with GIB 
from the eICU-CRD and 718 patients from the MIMIC-IV. To access the dynamic 
nomogram, please use the following link: 
https://kangzou.shinyapps.io/DynNomapp_GIB/ . The area under the receiver 
operating characteristic curve for the nomogram was 0.893 in the development 
set, 0.860 in the internal validation set, and 0.781 in the external validation 
set. The mortality rate was 25.7% in the high-risk group (nomogram 
scores > 101.974) and 2.8% in the low-risk group (nomogram scores ≤ 101.974). 
The nomogram exhibited excellent discrimination, calibration, and clinical 
utility in predicting in-hospital mortality among patients admitted to the 
intensive care unit with GIB.

BACKGROUND: High lactate to albumin ratio (LAR) has been reported to be 
associated to with poor prognosis in patients admitted to the intensive care 
unit (ICU). However, its role in predicting in-hospital mortality in AF patients 
admitted to ICU has not been explored.
METHODS: The Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care-IV (MIMIC-IV) database 
was used to retrieve information on patients who had been diagnosed with AF. 
X-tile software was utilized to determine the optimal cut-off LAR. Area under 
the receiver operating characteristic curves (AUC), calibration plots, and 
decision curve analysis (DCA) were conducted to assess the prediction 
performance of LAR for in-hospital mortality.
RESULTS: Finally, 8,287 AF patients were included and 1,543 death (18.6%) 
occurred. The optimal cut-off value of LAR is 0.5. Patients in lower LAR (< 0.5) 
group showed a better in-hospital survival compared to patients in higher LAR 
(≥ 0.5) group (HR: 2.67, 95%CI:2.39-2.97, P < 0.001). A nomogram for in-hospital 
mortality in patients with AF was constructed based on multivariate Cox analysis 
including age, CCI, β blockers usage, APSIII, hemoglobin and LAR. This nomogram 
exhibited excellent discrimination and calibration abilities in predicting 
in-hospital mortality for critically ill AF patients.
CONCLUSION: LAR, as a readily available biomarker, can predict in-hospital 
mortality in AF patients admitted to the ICU. The nomogram that combined LAR 
with other relevant variables performed exceptionally well in terms of 
predicting in-hospital mortality.

This research sought to ascertain the relationship between hematocrit (HCT) and 
mortality in patients with sepsis.
METHODS: A retrospective analysis was conducted on the clinical data of septic 
patients who were hospitalized between 2008 and 2019 in an advanced academic 
medical center in Boston, Massachusetts, registered in the Medical Information 
Mart for Intensive Care IV (MIMIC-IV) database, We analyzed basic information 
including gender, age, race, and types of the first admission, laboratory 
indicators including HCT, platelets, white blood cells, albumin, bilirubin, 
hemoglobin, and serum creatinine, and 30-day mortality. A Cox proportional 
hazards regression model was utilized to analyze the relationship between HCT 
and 30-day mortality in patients with sepsis.
RESULTS: This research recruited 2057 patients who met the research requirements 
from 2008 to 2019. According to the HCT level, it was classified into the low 
HCT level, the regular HCT level, and the high HCT level. The 30-day mortality 
rate was 62.6%, 27.5%, and 9.9% for patients with the low HCT level, the regular 
HCT level, and the high HCT level, respectively (p < 0.05). The multivariate Cox 
proportional hazard regression model analysis displayed that compared with 
patients with the regular HCT level, the 30-day mortality of patients with the 
low HCT level increased by 58.9% (hazard ratio = 1.589, 95% confidence interval 
(CI) = 1.009-2.979, p < 0.05).
CONCLUSION: The low HCT level is an independent risk factor for the increase of 
the 30-day mortality in patients with sepsis and can be used as a significant 
predictor of the clinical outcome of sepsis.

BACKGROUND: Sepsis still threatens the lives of more than 300 million patients 
annually and elderly patients with sepsis usually have a more complicated 
condition and a worse prognosis. Existing studies have shown that both 
Hematocrit (HCT) and albumin (ALB) can be used as potential predictors of 
sepsis, and their difference HCT-ALB has a significant capacity to diagnose 
infectious diseases. Currently, there is no relevant research on the 
relationship between HCT-ALB and the prognosis of elderly sepsis patients. 
Therefore, this study aims to explore the association between HCT-ALB and 
mortality in elderly patients with sepsis.
METHODS: This study was a multi-center retrospective study based on the Medical 
Information Mart for Intensive Care (MIMIC-IV) database and the eICU 
Collaborative Research Database (eICU-CRD) in elderly patients with sepsis. The 
optimal HCT-ALB cut-off point for ICU mortality was calculated by the Youden 
Index based on the eICU-CRD dataset, and multivariate logistic regressions were 
conducted to explore the association between HCT-ALB and ICU/hospital mortality 
in the two databases. Subgroup analyses were performed for different parameters 
and comorbidity status.
RESULTS: The number of 16,127 and 3043 elderly sepsis patients were selected 
from two large intensive care databases (eICU-CRD and MIMIC-IV, respectively) in 
this study. Depending on the optimal cut-off point, patients in both eICU-CRD 
and MIMIC-IV were independently divided into low HCT-ALB (< 6.7) and high 
HCT-ALB (≥ 6.7) groups. The odds ratio (95%confidence interval) [OR (95CI%)] of 
the high HCT-ALB group were 1.50 (1.36,1.65) and 1.71 (1.58,1.87) for ICU and 
hospital mortality in the eICU-CRD database after multivariable adjustment. 
Similar trends in the ICU and hospital mortality [OR (95%CI) 1.41 (1.15,1.72) 
and 1.27 (1.07,1.51)] were observed in MIMIC-IV database. Subgroup analysis 
showed an interaction effect with SOFA score in the eICU-CRD database however 
not in MIMIC-IV dataset.
CONCLUSIONS: High HCT-ALB (≥ 6.7) is associated with 1.41 and 1.27 times ICU and 
hospital mortality risk in elderly patients with sepsis. HCT-ALB is simple and 
easy to obtain and is a promising clinical predictor of early risk 
stratification for elderly sepsis patients in ICU.

OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study was to develop and validate a predictive 
model based on a machine learning (ML) approach to identify patients with DKA at 
increased risk of AKI within 1 week of hospitalization in the intensive care 
unit (ICU).
METHODS: Patients diagnosed with DKA from the Medical Information Mart for 
Intensive Care IV (MIMIC-IV) database according to the International 
Classification of Diseases (ICD)-9/10 code were included. The patient's medical 
history is extracted, along with data on their demographics, vital signs, 
clinical characteristics, laboratory results, and therapeutic measures. The 
best-performing model is chosen by contrasting the 8 Ml models. The area under 
the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC), sensitivity, accuracy, and 
specificity were calculated to select the best-performing ML model.
RESULTS: The final study enrolled 1,322 patients with DKA in total, randomly 
split into training (1,124, 85%) and validation sets (198, 15%). 497 (37.5%) of 
them experienced AKI within a week of being admitted to the ICU. The eXtreme 
Gradient Boosting (XGBoost) model performed best of the 8 Ml models, and the AUC 
of the training and validation sets were 0.835 and 0.800, respectively. 
According to the result of feature importance, the top 5 main features 
contributing to the XGBoost model were blood urea nitrogen (BUN), urine output, 
weight, age, and platelet count (PLT).
CONCLUSION: An ML-based individual prediction model for DKA-associated AKI 
(DKA-AKI) was developed and validated. The model performs robustly, identifies 
high-risk patients early, can assist in clinical decision-making, and can 
improve the prognosis of DKA patients to some extent.

Diabetes, regarded as a global health concerned disease, was focused by the 
World Health Organization (WHO). Patients with diabetes may have a 
hypercoagulable and hypo-fibrinolysis state. There is lots of research about 
cardiovascular effects on diabetes patients, but less about the coagulation 
system. This study is designed to investigate the relationship between 
coagulation indicators and 30-day mortality of critical diabetes patients. In 
this retrospective, single-center study, we included adult patients diagnosed 
with diabetes. Data, including demographic, complication, laboratory tests, 
scoring system, and anticoagulant treatment, were extracted from Medical 
Information Mart for Intensive Care (MIMIC-III). The receiver operating 
characteristic (ROC) curve and Kaplan-Meier curve were applied to predict the 
association of mortality and coagulation indicators. Cox hazard regression model 
and subgroup analysis were used to analyze the risk factors associated with 
30-day mortality. A total of 4026 patients with diabetes mellitus were included 
in our study, of whom 3312 survived after admitted to the hospital and 714 died. 
Cox hazard regression showed anticoagulant therapy might decrease the risk of 
30-day mortality after adjusted. In age <70 subgroup analysis, we found that 
patients with PTT <26.8 s or lightly increased PT may increase odds of 30-day 
hospital death (HR, 95%CI, 2.044 (1.376, 3.034), 1.562 (1.042, 2.343)). When age 
>70, lightly increased PTT may reduce the risk of mortality, but PT >16.3 s, a 
high level of hypo-coagulation state, increase risk of mortality (HR, 95%CI, 
0.756 (0.574, 0.996), 1.756 (1.129, 2.729)). Critical diabetes patients may 
benefit from anticoagulant agents. The abnormal coagulant function is related to 
the risk of 30-day mortality.

The occurrence of sepsis-associated acute kidney injury (SA-AKI) predicts a 
worse prognosis. We aimed to assess the impact of acetaminophen use on 
short-term mortality in patients with SA-AKI. A total of 6563 patients diagnosed 
with SA-AKI from the 2008 to 2019 Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care IV 
(MIMIC-IV) database were enrolled in this retrospective cohort study. The Cox 
regression model was utilized to analyze the associations of acetaminophen with 
30-day mortality and in-hospital mortality. Additional propensity score matching 
(PSM) analysis was performed regarding patients with acetaminophen use versus 
those without. Of these patients, 30-day mortality occurred in 1421 (21.65%) 
patients and in-hospital mortality in 1246 (18.99%) patients. Patients who used 
acetaminophen were associated with a reduced risk of 30-day mortality (hazard 
ratio (HR) = 0.80, 95% confidence interval (CI): 0.71-0.90) and in-hospital 
mortality (HR = 0.72, 95% CI: 0.63-0.82). The PSM analysis demonstrated that 
acetaminophen use was still related to a reduced risk of 30-day mortality and 
in-hospital mortality. Subgroup analysis showed that the relationships between 
acetaminophen and 30-day mortality and in-hospital mortality were consistent 
across subgroups (p < 0.05). The use of acetaminophen has an association with 
lower short-term mortality in patients with SA-AKI.

BACKGROUND: We aimed to establish and validate a prognostic nomogram model for 
improving the prediction of 30-day mortality of gastrointestinal bleeding (GIB) 
in critically ill patients with severe sepsis.
METHODS: In this retrospective study, the current retrospective cohort study 
extracted data from the Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care IV 
(MIMIC-IV) database, then partitioned the cohort randomly into training and 
validation subsets. The cohort was partitioned into training and validation 
subsets randomly. Our primary endpoint was 30-day all-cause mortality. To reduce 
data dimensionality and identify predictive variables, the least absolute 
shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) regression was employed. A prediction 
model was constructed by multivariate logistic regression. Model performance was 
evaluated using the concordance index (C-index), receiver operating 
characteristic (ROC) curve, and decision curve analysis (DCA).
RESULTS: The analysis included 1435 total patients, comprising 1005 in the 
training cohort and 430 in the validation cohort. We found that age, smoking 
status, glucose, (BUN), lactate, Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (SOFA) 
score, mechanical ventilation≥48h (MV), parenteral nutrition (PN), and chronic 
obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) independently influenced mortality in 
sepsis patients with concomitant GIB. The C-indices were 0.746 (0.700-0.792) and 
0.716 (0.663-0.769) in the training and validation sets, respectively. Based on 
the area under the curve (AUC) and DCA, the nomogram exhibited good 
discrimination for 30-day all-cause mortality in sepsis with GIB.
CONCLUSIONS: For sepsis patients complicated with GIB, we created a unique 
nomogram model to predict the 30-day all-cause mortality. This model could be a 
significant therapeutic tool for clinicians in terms of personalized treatment 
and prognosis prediction.

OBJECTIVE: Our study aimed to identify predictors as well as develop machine 
learning (ML) models to predict the risk of 30-day mortality in patients with 
sepsis-associated encephalopathy (SAE).
MATERIALS AND METHODS: ML models were developed and validated based on a public 
database named Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care (MIMIC)-IV. Models 
were compared by the area under the curve (AUC), accuracy, sensitivity, 
specificity, positive and negative predictive values, and Hosmer-Lemeshow good 
of fit test.
RESULTS: Of 6994 patients in MIMIC-IV included in the final cohort, a total of 
1232 (17.62%) patients died following SAE. Recursive feature elimination (RFE) 
selected 15 variables, including acute physiology score III (APSIII), Glasgow 
coma score (GCS), sepsis related organ failure assessment (SOFA), Charlson 
comorbidity index (CCI), red blood cell volume distribution width (RDW), blood 
urea nitrogen (BUN), age, respiratory rate, PaO2, temperature, lactate, 
creatinine (CRE), malignant cancer, metastatic solid tumor, and platelet (PLT). 
The validation cohort demonstrated all ML approaches had higher discriminative 
ability compared with the bagged trees (BT) model, although the difference was 
not statistically significant. Furthermore, in terms of the calibration 
performance, the artificial neural network (NNET), logistic regression (LR), and 
adapting boosting (Ada) models had a good calibration-namely, a high accuracy of 
prediction, with P-values of 0.831, 0.119, and 0.129, respectively.
CONCLUSIONS: The ML models, as demonstrated by our study, can be used to 
evaluate the prognosis of SAE patients in the intensive care unit (ICU). Online 
calculator could facilitate the sharing of predictive models.

BACKGROUND: The association of anion gap (AG) with short-term mortality in the 
critically ill patients with cardiac diseases is still not well understood.
OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the association of AG with short-term mortality, and the 
predictive ability of AG for short-term mortality in critically ill patients 
with cardiac diseases.
METHODS: This retrospective cohort study enrolled 9104 critically ill patients 
with cardiac diseases from the Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care III 
(MIMIC III) database. The restricted cubic spline models were used to evaluate 
the nonlinear relationship between AG and short-term mortality. Cox proportional 
hazards regression models and subgroup analysis were applied to assess the 
association of AG with short-term mortality.
RESULTS: The data were divided into three groups by AG tertiles: tertile I (AG 
<12, n = 2095), tertile II (12 ≤ AG < 15, n = 3195), and tertile III (15 ≤ AG, 
n = 3814). The restricted cubic spline models revealed continuous AG was 
non-linearly related to short-term mortality. The elevated AG tertiles were 
strongly associated with higher in-hospital, 30-day and 90-day mortality (all P 
for trend < 0.001). After adding AG to traditional severity scores, the area 
under curves (AUCs) elevated significantly compared to severity scores alone 
(all DeLong's test: P < 0.001). Subgroup analysis did not indicate significant 
interaction in most diverse subgroups.
CONCLUSION: AG was an independent risk factor for short-term all-cause mortality 
in critically ill patients with cardiac diseases. AG improved significantly the 
mortality predictive abilities of traditional severity scores when AG was added 
to these scores.

BACKGROUND: The present study aimed to evaluate the association between 
normalized lactate load, an index that incorporates the magnitude of change and 
the time interval of such evolution of lactate, and 28-day mortality in sepsis 
and non-sepsis patients. We also compared the accuracy of normalized lactate 
load in predicting mortality between these two populations.
METHODS: Data were extracted from the Medical Information Mart for Intensive 
Care (MIMIC)-IV database. We defined lactate load as the sum of the area under 
the lactate concentration curve; we also defined normalized lactate load as the 
lactate load divided by time. The performance of maximum lactate, mean lactate 
and normalized lactate load in predicting 28-day mortality in sepsis and 
non-sepsis patients were compared by receiver-operating characteristic curves 
analysis.
RESULTS: A total of 21,333 patients were included (4219 sepsis and 17,114 
non-sepsis patients). Non-survivors had significantly higher normalized lactate 
load than survivors in sepsis and non-sepsis patients. The maximum lactate, mean 
lactate, and normalized lactate load AUCs were significantly greater in sepsis 
patients than in non-sepsis patients. Normalized lactate load had the greatest 
AUCs in predicting 28-day mortality in both sepsis and non-sepsis patients. 
Sensitivity analysis showed that the AUC of normalized lactate load increased in 
non-sepsis patients when more lactate measurement was obtained, but it was not 
improved in sepsis patients.
CONCLUSIONS: Normalized lactate load has the strongest predictive power compared 
with maximum or mean lactate in both sepsis and non-sepsis patients. The 
accuracy of normalized lactate load in predicting mortality is better in sepsis 
patients than in non-sepsis patients.

Objective: To investigate the correlation between red blood cell transfusion and 
clinical outcome in patients after cardiac surgery. Methods: Demographic, 
clinical characteristics, treatment with/without transfusion, and outcomes of 
patients after cardiac surgery from the Medical Information Mart for Intensive 
Care-III database were collected. Patients were divided into two groups 
according to perioperative transfusion. A multivariable logistic regression 
analysis was utilized to adjust for the effect of red blood cell transfusion on 
outcomes for baseline and covariates and to determine its association with 
outcomes. Results: In total, 6,752 patients who underwent cardiac surgery were 
enrolled for the analysis. Among them, 2,760 (40.9%) patients received a 
perioperative transfusion. Compared with patients without red blood cell 
transfusion, transfused patients demonstrated worse outcomes in inhospital 
mortality, 1-year mortality, and all-cause mortality. Adjusting odds ratios 
(ORs) for the significant characteristic, patients with perioperative 
transfusion remained significantly associated with an increased risk of 
inhospital mortality [OR = 2.8, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.5-5.1, P = 
0.001], 1-year mortality (OR = 2.0, 95% CI 1.4-2.7, P < 0.001), and long-term 
mortality (OR = 2.2, 95% CI 1.8-2.8, P < 0.001). Conclusion: Perioperative red 
blood cell transfusion is associated with a worse prognosis of cardiac surgery 
patients. Optimal perioperative management and restricted transfusion strategy 
might be considered in selected patients.

PURPOSE: Sepsis is one of the leading causes of morbidity and mortality 
worldwide with approximately 50 million annual cases. There is ongoing debate on 
the clinical benefit of hydrocortisone in the prevention of death in septic 
patients. Here we evaluated the association between hydrocortisone treatment and 
mortality in patients diagnosed with sepsis in a large-scale clinical dataset.
METHODS: Data from patients between 2008 and 2019 were extracted from the 
retrospective Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care IV (MIMIC-IV) 
database. Patients who received hydrocortisone after diagnosis were matched 
using propensity-score matching with patients who did not, to balance 
confounding (by indication and contraindication) factors between the groups. 
90-day mortality and survivors' length of hospital stay was compared between 
patients who did or did not receive hydrocortisone.
RESULTS: A total of 31,749 septic patients were included in the study (mean age: 
67, men: 57.3%, in-hospital mortality: 15.6%). 90-day mortality was higher among 
the 1802 patients receiving hydrocortisone when compared with the 6348 matched 
non-users (hazard ratio: 1.35, 95% CI: 1.24-1.47). Hydrocortisone treatment was 
also associated with increased in-hospital mortality (40.9% vs. 27.6%, 
p < 0.0001) and prolonged hospital stay in those who survived until discharge 
(median 12.6 days vs. 10.8 days, p < 0.0001). Stratification for age, gender, 
ethnicity, occurrence of septic shock, and the need for vasopressor drug 
administration such as (nor)epinephrine did not reveal sub-population(s) 
benefiting of hydrocortisone use.
CONCLUSION: Hydrocortisone treatment is associated with increased risk of death 
as well as prolonged hospital stay in septic patients. Although residual 
confounding (by indication) cannot be ruled out completely due to the 
observational nature of the study, the present study suggests clinical 
implication of hydrocortisone use in patients with sepsis.

This study aims to develop and validate a machine learning (ML) predictive model 
for assessing mortality in patients with malignant tumors and hyperkalemia 
(MTH). We extracted data on patients with MTH from the Medical Information Mart 
for Intensive Care-IV, version 2.2 (MIMIC-IV v2.2) database. The dataset was 
split into a training set (75%) and a validation set (25%). We used the Least 
Absolute Shrinkage and Selection Operator (LASSO) regression to identify 
potential predictors, which included clinical laboratory indicators and vital 
signs. Pearson correlation analysis tested the correlation between predictors. 
In-hospital death was the prediction target. The Area Under the Curve (AUC) and 
accuracy of the training and validation sets of 7 ML algorithms were compared, 
and the optimal 1 was selected to develop the model. The calibration curve was 
used to evaluate the prediction accuracy of the model further. SHapley Additive 
exPlanations (SHAP) and Local Interpretable Model-agnostic Explanations (LIME) 
enhanced model interpretability. 496 patients with MTH in the Intensive Care 
Unit (ICU) were included. After screening, 17 clinical features were included in 
the construction of the ML model, and the Pearson correlation coefficient was 
<0.8, indicating that the correlation between the clinical features was small. 
eXtreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost) outperformed other algorithms, achieving 
perfect scores in the training set (accuracy: 1.000, AUC: 1.000) and high scores 
in the validation set (accuracy: 0.734, AUC: 0.733). The calibration curves 
indicated good predictive calibration of the model. SHAP analysis identified the 
top 8 predictive factors: urine output, mean heart rate, maximum urea nitrogen, 
minimum oxygen saturation, minimum mean blood pressure, maximum total bilirubin, 
mean respiratory rate, and minimum pH. In addition, SHAP and LIME performed 
in-depth individual case analyses. This study demonstrates the effectiveness of 
ML methods in predicting mortality risk in ICU patients with MTH. It highlights 
the importance of predictors like urine output and mean heart rate. SHAP and 
LIME significantly enhanced the model's interpretability.

PURPOSE: High levels of red blood cell distribution width (RDW) and 
hypoalbuminemia are markers of poor prognosis in chronic obstructive pulmonary 
disease (COPD) patients. However, few studies have shown that the red blood cell 
distribution width-albumin ratio (RAR) is related to the mortality of COPD. This 
study aimed to explore the relationship between RAR and hospital mortality in 
COPD patients admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU).
PATIENTS AND METHODS: Patients were retrospectively incorporated from the 
Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care IV (MIMIC-IV) database and divided 
into two groups by a cutoff value of RAR. Propensity score matching (PSM) was 
performed to adjust for the imbalance of covariates. Logistic regression models 
and subgroup analyses were carried out to investigate the relationship between 
RAR and hospital mortality. The receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve 
was used to evaluate the predictive performance of RAR and decision curve 
analysis (DCA) to assess the clinical utility.
RESULTS: In total, 1174 patients were finally identified from the MIMIC-IV 
database. The cutoff value for RAR was 5.315%/g/dL. After PSM at a 1:1 ratio, 
638 patients were included in the matched cohort. In the original and matched 
cohorts, the high RAR group had higher hospital mortality and longer hospital 
stays. Logistic regression analysis suggested that RAR was an independent risk 
factor for hospital mortality. The areas under the ROC curve in the original and 
matched cohorts were 0.706 and 0.611, respectively, which were larger than 
applying RDW alone (the original cohort: 0.600, the matched cohort: 0.514). The 
DCA indicated that RAR had a clinical utility.
CONCLUSION: A higher RAR (>5.315%/g/dL) was associated with hospital mortality 
in COPD patients admitted to ICU. As an easily available peripheral blood 
marker, RAR can predict hospital mortality in critically ill patients with COPD 
independently.

This study aimed to develop models for predicting the 30-day mortality of 
sepsis-associated delirium (SAD) by multiple machine learning (ML) algorithms. 
On the whole, a cohort of 3,197 SAD patients were collected from the Medical 
Information Mart for Intensive Care (MIMIC)-IV database. Among them, a total of 
659 (20.61%) patients died following SAD. The patients who died were about 73.00 
(62.00, 82.00) years old and mostly male (56.75%). Recursive feature elimination 
(RFE) was used to distinguish risk factors. Subsequently, six ML algorithms 
including artificial neural network (NNET), gradient boosting machine (GBM), 
adaptive boosting (Ada), random forest (RF), eXtreme Gradient Boosting (XGB) and 
logistic regression (LR) were employed to establish models to predict the 30-day 
mortality of SAD. The performance of models was assessed via both discrimination 
and calibration by cross-validation with 100 resamples. Overall, 10 independent 
predictors, including Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS), Sequential Organ Failure 
Assessment (SOFA), anion gap (AG), continuous renal replacement therapy (CRRT), 
temperature, mean corpuscular hemoglobin concentration (MCHC), vasopressor, 
blood urea nitrogen (BUN), base excess (BE), and bicarbonate were identified as 
independent predictors for the 30-day mortality of SAD. The validation cohort 
demonstrated that all these six models had relatively favorable differentiation, 
while among them, the GBM model had the highest area under the curve (AUC) of 
0.845 (95% Confidence Interval (CI): 0.816, 0.874). Furthermore, the calibration 
curve of these six models was close to the diagonal line in the validation sets. 
As for decision curve analysis, the predictive models were clinically useful as 
well. Based on real-world research, we developed ML models to provide 
personalized predictions of delirium-related mortality in sepsis patients, 
potentially enabling clinicians to identify high-risk SAD patients more 
promptly.

BACKGROUND: The aim of this study was to investigate the prognostic role of 
platelet to albumin ratio (PAR) and in persistent acute kidney injury (pAKI) of 
patients admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU).
METHODS: We involved pAKI patients from the Medical Information Mart for 
Intensive Care-IV (MIMIC-IV) database and eICU Collaborative Research Database 
(eICU-CRD). Receiver operating curve (ROC) analysis was performed to evaluate 
the optimal cut-off PAR.
RESULTS: A total of 7,646 patients were finally included in the present study. 
The optimal cut-off value of PAR was 7.2. The high-PAR group was associated with 
pAKI (hazard ratio [HR]: 3.25, 95% CI: 2.85-3.72, P < 0.001). We also performed 
this in the validation cohort, the results further confirmed that the high-PAR 
group was associated with pAKI (HR: 2.24, 95% CI: 1.86-2.71, P < 0.001). The PAR 
exhibited good pAKI predictive abilities in the original cohort (C-index: 0.726, 
95%CI: 0.714-0.739) and in the validation cohort (C-index: 0.744, 
95%CI:0.722-0.766) Moreover, as a systemic inflammatory indicator, PAR depicted 
better predictive ability compared to other systemic inflammatory indicators.
CONCLUSION: The present study manifested that elevated PAR could predicts pAKI 
in patients admitted to ICU. PAR may be an easily obtained and useful biomarker 
to clinicians for the early identification of pAKI.

This study aimed to investigate the relationship between serum phosphate levels, 
changes in serum phosphate levels, and 28-day mortality in patients with septic 
shock. In this retrospective study, data were collected from the Medical 
Information Mart for Intensive Care IV (MIMIC-IV) database between 2008 and 
2019. Patients were divided into three groups according to the tertiles of serum 
phosphate levels. Kaplan-Meier curves and log-rank test analyses were used for 
survival analysis. Multivariate logistic regression, and restricted cubic spline 
(RCS) curve were used to explore the association between serum phosphate, delta 
serum phosphate levels and 28-day mortality. In total, 3296 patients with septic 
shock were included in the study, and the 28-day mortality was 30.0%. Serum 
phosphate levels were significantly higher in the non-survivor group than in the 
survivor group. The Kaplan-Meier curves showed significant differences among the 
three groups. Multivariate logistic regression analysis and the RCS curve showed 
that serum phosphate levels were independently and positively associated with 
the 28-day mortality of septic shock. Non-survivors had higher delta serum 
phosphate levels than survivors. Survival analysis showed that patients with 
higher delta serum phosphate levels had higher 28-day mortality. A non-linear 
relationship was detected between delta serum phosphate and 28-day mortality 
with a point of inflection at - 0.3 mg/dL. Serum phosphate levels were 
positively and independently associated with 28-day mortality in septic shock. 
Delta serum phosphate level was a high-risk factor for patients with septic 
shock.

BACKGROUND: Myocardial infarction (MI) complicated by heart failure (HF) is a 
common and severe clinical condition associated with poor outcomes. Estimated 
plasma volume status (ePVS), a marker of congestion derived from hemoglobin and 
hematocrit, has shown promise in predicting outcomes in various cardiovascular 
diseases. This study aimed to investigate the relationship between ePVS and both 
short-term and long-term prognosis in patients with MI complicated by HF.
METHODS: A retrospective cohort study was conducted using data from the Medical 
Information Mart for Intensive Care IV (MIMIC-IV) database, including 3,238 
patients with MI complicated by HF. Patients were stratified into quartiles 
based on ePVS values. The primary outcomes were in-hospital mortality, 180-day 
mortality, and 1-year mortality. Kaplan-Meier curves, multivariate Cox 
regression analysis, and subgroup analyses were performed to assess the 
relationship between ePVS and outcomes.
RESULTS: Kaplan-Meier analysis showed significant differences in survival rates 
across ePVS quartiles for all outcomes (P < 0.001). Multivariate logistic 
regression analysis revealed that patients in the highest quartile of ePVS (Q4 
vs. Q1) had an independently increased risk of in-hospital mortality (OR 1.58, 
95% CI 1.16-2.13, P = 0.003). Cox regression analysis further demonstrated that 
higher ePVS (Q4 vs. Q1) was associated with an increased risk of 180-day 
mortality (HR 1.45, 95% CI 1.19-1.75, P < 0.001) and 1-year mortality (HR 1.51, 
95% CI 1.27-1.80, P < 0.001). Both Kaplan-Meier survival curves and restricted 
cubic spline models confirmed a positive association between ePVS and long-term 
mortality risks.The association between ePVS and long-term outcomes was stronger 
than for in-hospital mortality. Subgroup analyses revealed that the relationship 
between ePVS and long-term mortality was more pronounced in patients with 
systolic blood pressure below 140 mmHg, lower LODS and OASIS scores, and those 
without hemorrhagic disorders or anemia (P for interaction <0.05).
CONCLUSION: ePVS was an independent predictor of both short-term and long-term 
mortality in patients with MI complicated by HF. Its prognostic value was 
particularly significant for long-term outcomes, suggesting its potential 
utility in risk stratification and guiding treatment strategies for this 
high-risk population.

BACKGROUND: Compared to the conventional anion gap, the albumin-corrected anion 
gap (ACAG) offers a more precise measure of acid-base imbalance, providing 
superior prognostic insight. However, the prognostic relevance of ACAG in 
individuals of atrial fibrillation (AF) remains insufficiently explored. This 
research seeks to evaluate the correlation between ACAG levels and mortality 
risk in individuals with AF.
METHODS: We identified individuals diagnosed with AF from the Medical 
Information Mart for Intensive Care (MIMIC)-IV database. Participants were 
categorized into quartiles based on their ACAG levels. The outcomes included 30 
days and 365 days all-cause mortality. Kaplan-Meier survival curves were 
utilized to evaluate cumulative survival across the ACAG quartiles. We applied 
Cox regression and restricted cubic spline regression analyses to evaluate the 
correlation between ACAG levels and prognosis. Subgroup analyses and interaction 
assessments were applied to confirm the robustness of the findings.
RESULTS: A total of 2920 AF patients (54.93% male) were incorporated into the 
analysis, with 1.61% identified as having paroxysmal AF. The 30-day and 365-day 
mortality rates were 22.91% and 39.21%, respectively. Kaplan-Meier survival 
curves demonstrated that elevated ACAG levels were significantly linked to 
increased mortality (log-rank P < 0.001). In multivariate Cox proportional 
hazards analyses, increased ACAG independently predicted mortality at both 30 
days (adjusted hazard ratio [aHR], 1.04; 95% CI, 1.02-1.05; P < 0.01) and 365 
days (aHR, 1.03; 95% CI, 1.02-1.05; P < 0.01) after adjusting for potential 
confounders. A positive relationship between rising ACAG levels and mortality 
risk was showed by restricted cubic spline analysis. Subgroup analyses revealed 
no significant interactions (all interaction P-values > 0.05).
CONCLUSIONS: In individuals with AF, higher ACAG levels are related to a greater 
mortality risk at 30 and 365 days. These findings suggest that ACAG may serve as 
a valuable prognostic marker for AF patient stratification. Incorporating ACAG 
into clinical decision-making could support improved therapeutic strategies and 
enhance patient outcomes.

BACKGROUND: Red blood cell distribution width (RDW) and albumin level were 
considered to be related to the prognosis of patients with acute myocardial 
infarction (AMI). This study aims to investigate the correlation between RAR and 
90-day mortality in AMI patients.
METHODS: Data of AMI patients were obtained from the Medical Information Mart 
for Intensive Care III (MIMIC-III) database. According to the median, RAR < 4.32 
was regarded as low RAR level group, and RAR ≥ 4.32 as high RAR level group; low 
RDW level group was defined as < 14.00%, and high RDW level group as ≥ 14.00%; 
albumin < 3.30 g/dL was low level group, and albumin ≥ 3.30 g/dL as high level 
group. The outcome was the mortality rate within 90 days after admission to ICU. 
Univariate and multivariate Cox models were performed to determine the 
relationship between RAR and 90-day mortality in AMI patients with hazard ratio 
(HR) and 95% confidence interval (CI). Stratification analyses were conducted to 
explore the effect of RAR on 90-day mortality in different subgroups of age, 
gender, simplified acute physiology score II (SAPS II), elixhauser comorbidity 
index (ECI) score, treatment modalities and white blood cell.
RESULTS: Of the total 2081 AMI patients, 543 (26.09%) died within 90-day 
follow-up duration. The results showed that high RAR (HR = 1.65, 95% CI 
1.34-2.03) and high RDW levels (HR = 1.31, 95% CI 1.08-1.61) were associated 
with an increased risk of death in AMI patients, and that high albumin level was 
related to a decreased risk of death (HR = 0.77, 95%CI 0.64-0.93). The 
relationship of RAR level and the mortality of AMI patients was also observed in 
the subgroup analysis. Additionally, the finding indicated that RAR might be a 
more effective biomarker for predicting 90-day mortality of AMI patients than 
albumin, RDW.
CONCLUSION: RAR may be a potential marker for the prognostic assessment of AMI, 
and a high RAR level was correlated with increased risk of 90-day mortality of 
AMI patients.

Inflammation plays a critical role in vertebral fractures. However, there is a 
lack of sufficient evidence regarding the prognostic significance of the 
systemic immuno-inflammatory index (SII), a novel marker of systemic 
inflammation, in patients with vertebral fractures. In this study, we aimed to 
assess the predictive value of SII in critically ill patients with vertebral 
fractures. The data were from the Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care 
III (MIMIC-III) version 1.4 and Wenzhou Hospital of Traditional Chinese 
Medicine. The cutoff values for SII were determined using the receiver operating 
characteristic curve, and the subjects were grouped accordingly. The clinical 
outcome measured was mortality within 30 days, 90 days, or 1 year. The following 
formula was used to calculate the SII: SII = (platelet count) × (neutrophil 
count)/ (lymphocyte count). Cox proportional-hazard models were employed to 
assess the relationship between SII and survival. Additionally, propensity score 
matching analysis and COX models were utilized to examine the association 
between SII and survival outcomes. The Pearson correlation test confirmed the 
correlation between SII and vertebral T-values measured by bone mineral density 
and pain indicator. A total of 354 patients were finally included from MIMIC-III 
in the univariate analysis, for the 30-day mortality, SII ≥ 3164 group, the 
hazard ratio (HR) (95% confidence interval) was 1.71 (1.01, 2.94). After 
adjusting for age, gender, race, anion gap, creatinine, systolic blood pressure 
(SBP), DBP MBP, SOFA, acute physiologic score III, chronic kidney disease, and 
SAPS II, SII ≥ 3164 was found to be an independent significant risk factor for 
death in patients (HR = 1.85, 95% CI: 1.06-3.24, P = .0315). A similar trend was 
observed for 90-day mortality and 1-year mortality. Propensity scores matching 
analysis further confirmed the association of SII and the prognosis of patients. 
Our validation results were consistent with it. Besides, the Pearson correlation 
test confirmed a significant correlation between SII and vertebral T-values 
measured by bone mineral density and pain indicator. The study findings revealed 
that SII is an independent predictor of mortality in patients with vertebral 
fractures. This indicates that SII can serve as a reliable and easily accessible 
prognostic indicator for newly diagnosed critically ill patients with vertebral 
fractures.

PURPOSE: This study aims to develop an accurate and simplified scoring system 
based on the national early warning score (NEWS) to predict the mortality of 
intensive care unit (ICU) patients.
METHODS: The information of patients was retrieved from the Medical Information 
Mart for Intensive Care (MIMIC)-III and -IV databases. The Modified National 
Early Warning Score (MNEWS) of the patients was calculated. The discrimination 
ability of the MNEWS, acute physiology and chronic health scoring system II 
(APACHE II), and original NEWS systems in predicting patients' mortality was 
evaluated using area under the receiver operating characteristic (AUROC) 
analysis. The DeLong test was used to estimate the receiver operating 
characteristic curve. The Hosmer-Lemeshow goodness-of-fit test was then applied 
to evaluate the calibration of the MNEWS.
RESULTS: In total, 7275 ICU patients from the MIMIC-III and -IV databases were 
included in the derivation cohort and 1507 ICU patients from Xi'an Medical 
University were included in the validation cohort. In the derivation cohort, the 
nonsurvivors had significantly higher MNEWSs than the survivors (12.5 ± 3.4 vs 
8.8 ± 3.4, P < 0.05). MNEWS and APACHE II both had a better performance than the 
NEWS in predicting hospital mortality and 90-day mortality. The optimal cutoff 
of MNEWS was 11. Patients with an MNEWS ≥ 11 had significantly shorter survival 
than those having an MNEWS of <11. Furthermore, MNEWS had a high calibration 
ability in predicting hospital mortality of ICU patients (χ2 = 6.534 and 
P = 0.588) by the Hosmer-Lemeshow test. This finding was confirmed in the 
validation cohort.
CONCLUSION: MNEWS is a simple and accurate scoring system for evaluating the 
severity and predicting the outcomes of ICU patients.

BACKGROUND: Inflammation plays an important role in the development of acute 
kidney injury (AKI). However, there are few studies exploring the prognostic 
influence of C-reactive protein to albumin ratio (CAR) among AKI patients. In 
this study, we investigated whether CAR could be a useful marker to predict the 
mortality of AKI.
METHODS: A total of 358 AKI patients were extracted from the Medical Information 
Mart for Intensive Care III (MIMIC III) database. C-reactive protein (CRP) and 
albumin were measured at ICU admission. The clinical outcome was 365-day 
mortality. Cox proportional hazards model and Kaplan-Meier survival analysis 
were conducted to evaluate the association between CAR and outcome.
RESULTS: Compared with patients in the survival group, nonsurvivors had higher 
CAR levels. The area under the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve of 
CAR was higher than that of CRP and albumin for mortality (0.64 vs. 0.63, 0.59, 
respectively). The cut-off point of CAR for mortality was 7.23. In Cox 
proportional-hazard regression analysis, CAR (hazards ratio (HR) =2.04, 95% 
confidence interval (CI) =1.47-2.85, p < 0.001 for higher CAR) and Simplified 
Acute Physiology Score II (HR = 1.02, 95%CI = 1.00-1.03, p = 0.004) were 
independent predictors of 365-day mortality.
CONCLUSIONS: Our study demonstrated that a higher level of CAR was associated 
with 365-day mortality in AKI patients.

The relationship between three scoring systems (LODS, OASIS, and SAPS II) and 
in-hospital mortality of intensive care patients with ST segment elevation 
myocardial infarction (STEMI) is currently inconclusive. The baseline data, LODS 
score, OASIS score, SAPS II score, and in-hospital prognosis of intensive care 
patients with STEMI were retrieved from the Medical Information Mart for 
Intensive Care IV database. Propensity score matching analysis was performed to 
reduce bias. Receiver operating characteristic curves (ROC) were drawn for the 
three scoring systems, and comparisons between the areas under the ROC curves 
(AUC) were conducted. Decision curve analysis (DCA) was performed to determine 
the net benefits of the three scoring systems. LODS and SAPS II were independent 
risk factors for in-hospital mortality. For the study cohort, the AUCs of LODS, 
OASIS, SAPS II were 0.867, 0.827, and 0.894; after PSM, the AUCs of LODS, OASIS, 
SAPS II were 0.877, 0.821, and 0.881. A stratified analysis of the patients who 
underwent percutaneous coronary intervention/coronary artery bypass grafting 
(PCI/CABG) or not was conducted. In the PCI/CABG group, the AUCs of LODS, OASIS, 
SAPS II were 0.853, 0.825, and 0.867, while in the non-PCI/CABG group, the AUCs 
of LODS, OASIS, SAPS II were 0.857, 0.804, and 0.897. The results of the Z test 
suggest that the predictive value of LODS and SAPS II was not statistically 
different, but both were higher than OASIS. According to the DCA, the net 
clinical benefit of LODS was the greatest. LODS and SAPS II have excellent 
predictive value, and in most cases, both were higher than OASIS. With a more 
concise composition and greater clinical benefit, LODS may be a better predictor 
of in-hospital mortality for intensive care patients with STEMI.

BACKGROUND: The correlation between the triglyceride-glucose index (TyG) and the 
prognosis of ischemic stroke has been well established. This study aims to 
assess the influence of the TyG index on the clinical outcomes of critically ill 
individuals suffering from intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH).
METHODS: Patients diagnosed with ICH were retrospectively retrieved from the 
Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care (MIMIC-IV) and the eICU 
Collaborative Research Database (eICU-CRD). Various statistical methods, 
including restricted cubic spline (RCS) regression, multivariable logistic 
regression, subgroup analysis, and sensitivity analysis, were employed to 
examine the relationship between the TyG index and the primary outcomes of ICH.
RESULTS: A total of 791 patients from MIMIC-IV and 1,113 ones from eICU-CRD were 
analyzed. In MIMIC-IV, the in-hospital and ICU mortality rates were 14% and 10%, 
respectively, while in eICU-CRD, they were 16% and 8%. Results of the RCS 
regression revealed a consistent linear relationship between the TyG index and 
the risk of in-hospital and ICU mortality across the entire study population of 
both databases. Logistic regression analysis revealed a significant positive 
association between the TyG index and the likelihood of in-hospital and ICU 
death among ICH patients in both databases. Subgroup and sensitivity analysis 
further revealed an interaction between patients' age and the TyG index in 
relation to in-hospital and ICU mortality among ICH patients. Notably, for 
patients over 60 years old, the association between the TyG index and the risk 
of in-hospital and ICU mortality was more pronounced compared to the overall 
study population in both MIMIC-IV and eICU-CRD databases, suggesting a 
synergistic effect between old age (over 60 years) and the TyG index on the 
in-hospital and ICU mortality of patients with ICH.
CONCLUSIONS: This study established a positive correlation between the TyG index 
and the risk of in-hospital and ICU mortality in patients over 60 years who 
diagnosed with ICH, suggesting that the TyG index holds promise as an indicator 
for risk stratification in this patient population.

BACKGROUND: The severity of sepsis is associated with systemic clotting 
activation. Atrial fibrillation (AF) is the most commonly observed arrhythmia in 
patients with sepsis and can lead to a poor prognosis. The aim of this study is 
to elucidate the association between oral anticoagulants and survival from 
septic patients complicated with AF.
METHODS: The data of 8,828 septic patients, including 2,955 AF and 5,873 without 
AF, were all originated from the Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care IV 
(MIMIC-IV) database. Patients with sepsis and AF are divided into OAC- group 
(n = 1,774) and OAC+ group (n = 1,181) based on OAC therapy. Septic patients 
with no AF were considered as the control group (n = 5,873, sepsis and no AF 
group). The main outcome endpoint was the survival rate of 30 day. The secondary 
outcome endpoint was the length of stay (LOS) from intensive care unit and 
hospital. Propensity score matching (PSM) was used to adjust the influence of 
superfluous factors, and a restricted mean survival time (RMST) analysis was 
used for calculating the benefit of survival time and survival rate. Analysis 
including univariate and multivariate logistic regression analysis was conducted 
to find prognosis-related predictors.
RESULTS: After PSM, the OAC+group had a higher 30-day survival rate compared to 
the OAC- group (81.59% vs. 58.10%; P < 0.001) in the ICU. Despite the higher 
survival, the hospital LOS (14.65 days vs. 16.66 days; P = 0.15) and ICU LOS 
(6.93 days vs. 5.92 days; P = 0.02) were prolonged at OAC+ group than OAC- 
group. No difference was found in survival rate of 30 day between the sepsis 
patients using warfarin and patients using NOAC (85.60% vs. 79.84%, P = 0.12). 
The sepsis patients using warfarin had a prolonged LOS in ICU and hospital 
compared with the sepsis patients using NOAC. In the vasopressor subgroup, 
patients who received NOAC therapy were associated with a reduced 30-day 
survival rate (73.57% vs. 84.03%; P = 0.04) and reduced LOS in ICU and hospital 
than those on warfarin therapy.
CONCLUSION: This study demonstrated that oral anticoagulants may increase the 
30-day survival rate of patients with sepsis and AF.

BACKGROUND: The fibrinogen-to-albumin ratio (FAR), a novel inflammatory 
biomarker, is strongly associated with the incidence of sepsis. Nonetheless, 
there is a lack of research regarding the FAR and prognosis in individuals with 
septic acute kidney injury (SAKI). The aim of this study was to assess the 
correlation between the FAR upon intensive care unit (ICU) admission and overall 
mortality in patients with SAKI.
METHODS: All patient information was retrieved from the Medical Information Mart 
for Intensive Care-IV (MIMIC-IV) database. All patients were divided into four 
distinct categories according to the FAR. The primary endpoints for this study 
were the 30-day and 365-day all-cause death rates, whereas the secondary 
endpoints were the 60-day, 90-day and 180-day all-cause death rates. The FAR was 
quartile, and the Kaplan-Meier curve was used to evaluate the outcomes across 
the groups. To evaluate the correlation between the FAR and outcomes, we used a 
Cox proportional hazards regression model and restricted cubic splines (RCSs).
RESULTS: Among the 6208 participants, the average age was 65 years, with 3659 
(58.94%) identified as male. Patients exhibiting elevated FAR values 
demonstrated an increased risk of all-cause mortality at 30, 60, 90, 180 and 
365 days, as evidenced by the Kaplan-Meier curves (log-rank P < .001). SAKI 
patients with elevated FAR values had a greater risk of all-cause mortality at 
30, 60, 90, 180 and 365 days than did those with lower FAR values, as 
demonstrated by Cox proportional hazards regression analysis. With inflection 
points at 35.14 for 30-day mortality and 34.8 for 365-day mortality, the RCS 
analysis revealed that the FAR and all-cause mortality were related in an 
inverted N-type pattern. In instances where FAR levels were below 35.14 mg/g, a 
reduction of 1 unit in the FAR correlated with a 6.5% increase in the risk of 
30-day all-cause mortality [hazard ratio (HR) 0.935; 95% confidence interval 
(CI) 0.923, 0.948]. In instances where FAR levels were below 34.8 mg/g, a 
reduction of 1 unit in the FAR correlated with a 6.2% increase in the risk of 
365-day all-cause mortality (HR 0.938; 95% CI 0.927, 0.949).
CONCLUSION: In severely ill patients with SAKI, elevated FAR levels are strongly 
correlated with an increased risk of all-cause mortality at 30, 60, 90, 180 and 
365 days. FAR may serve as a reliable metric for assessing and managing patients 
with SAKI in the ICU.

We previously reported the added value of 24-hour lactate concentration alone 
and in combination with 24-hour lactate clearance and lactate concentration at 
admission for the prediction of inhospital mortality in critically ill patients 
with sepsis. We aimed to validate this finding.
DERIVATION COHORT: The derivation cohort from Leiden, The Netherlands, consisted 
of 451 critically ill patients with sepsis.
VALIDATION COHORT: The validation cohort consisted of 4,440 critically ill adult 
patients with sepsis from the Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care cohort 
admitted to the ICU of Beth Israel Deaconness Medical Center, Boston, MA, 
between January 2006 and 2018.
PREDICTION MODEL: Predictors of mortality were: age, chronic comorbidities, 
length of stay pre-ICU, Glasgow Coma Scale, and Acute Physiology Score. Lactate 
concentration at 24-hour alone, in combination with 24-hour lactate clearance 
and in combination with lactate concentration at admission, was added to assess 
improvement of the prediction model. The outcome was inhospital mortality.
RESULTS: Inhospital mortality occurred in 160 patients (36%) in the derivation 
cohort and in 2,347 patients (53%) in the validation cohort. The Acute 
Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation (APACHE) IV model had a moderate 
discriminative performance (recalibrated C-statistic, 0.62; 95% CI, 0.60-0.63). 
Addition of 24-hour lactate concentration increased the recalibrated C-statistic 
to 0.64 (95% CI, 0.62-0.66). The model with 24-hour lactate concentration and 
lactate concentration at admission showed the best fit as depicted by the 
smallest Akaike Information Criterion in both the derivation and validation 
data.
CONCLUSION: The 24-hour lactate concentration and lactate concentration at 
admission contribute modestly to prediction of inhospital mortality in 
critically ill patients with sepsis. Future updates and possible modification of 
APACHE IV should consider the incorporation of lactate concentration at baseline 
and at 24 hours.

BACKGROUND: Hypoalbuminemia is common in congestive heart failure (CHF) 
patients. Serum albumin is associated with the prognosis of CHF patients. Impact 
of albumin infusion on prognosis of patients with CHF-hypoalbuminemia overlap 
remains unclear. We retrospectively investigated the impact of albumin infusion 
on prognosis of intensive care unit (ICU) patients with CHF-hypoalbuminemia 
overlap.
METHODS: We enrolled all patients whose diagnosis included CHF [ICD-9 
(international classification of diseases 9) code =428.0] at first ICU admission 
from the MIMIC III (Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care III) database, 
and excluded those with missing serum albumin values, with serum albumin >3.4 
g/dL or <18 years old. According to the exposure of albumin infusion during 
hospitalization, patients were stratified into non-albumin and albumin groups. 
Propensity-score matching (PSM) was performed (1:1 ratio) to control for 
baseline confounding. Outcome measures were in-hospital mortality as well as 
length of stay in the ICU (ICU LOS) and the hospital (hospital LOS).
RESULTS: There were 3,190 eligible patients in the initial search. Patients with 
albumin infusion had markedly higher in-hospital mortality (36.42% vs. 21.81%, 
P<0.001), longer ICU LOS [median 6.93 (3.39-14.82) vs. 3.84 (1.96-8.00) days, 
P<0.001], and longer hospital LOS [median 17.46 (11.45-28.33) vs. 10.92 
(6.81-18.00) days, P<0.001] than those without albumin infusion. The 
multivariate logistic regression analysis revealed that albumin infusion [odds 
ratio (OR), 1.509; 95% confidence interval (CI), 1.164-1.957; P=0.002] was 
significantly associated with increased risk of in-hospital mortality. After 
PSM, a cohort of 429 pairs of patients was included in the final analysis. 
Patients with albumin infusion had markedly higher in-hospital mortality (34.97% 
vs. 27.27%, P=0.015), longer ICU LOS [median 8.43 (4.33-16.28) vs. 6.43 
(3.07-13.66) days, P<0.001], and longer hospital LOS [median 16.92 (11.27-28.06) 
vs. 13.33 (8.00-21.10) days, P<0.001] than those without albumin infusion. The 
multivariate logistic regression analysis revealed that albumin infusion (OR, 
1.594; 95% CI, 1.143-2.223; P=0.006) was significantly associated with increased 
risk of in-hospital mortality.
CONCLUSIONS: Albumin infusion increased in-hospital mortality, ICU LOS, and 
hospital LOS in ICU patients with CHF-hypoalbuminemia overlap.

BACKGROUND: Thrombocytopenia is commonly observed in patients with sepsis and is 
an independent risk factor for poor prognosis. However, the changes of platelet 
count caused by different pathogens can vary significantly. Our study aims to 
evaluate the quantitative changes in platelet count in response to various 
pathogens.
MATERIAL AND METHODS: We retrospectively analysed data of 3044 patients with 
sepsis from Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care (MIMIC, 2008-2019) 
database and prospectively collected data of 364 patients with sepsis from our 
local cohort of the Shandong Bloodstream Infection and Sepsis Collaboration 
Study (SBISC, 2020-2022). Propensity score matching (PSM) was employed to 
control for baseline differences in variables, except for the causative 
pathogen.
RESULTS: Multivariate logistic analyses of both original and PSM populations 
identified Candida, Escherichia, Klebsiella, and Serratia species posing a 
higher risk for thrombocytopenia compared to others. Restricted cubic spline 
(RCS) curves showed L- or U-shaped associations between platelet count and 
28-mortality with various cut-off values among different pathogens: ranging from 
96 × 109/L in Candida species - 190 × 109/L in Klebsiella species.
CONCLUSION: Our present findings indicate a pathogen-specific effect on platelet 
count, highlighting the importance of monitoring thrombocytopenia in patients 
infected with above microorganisms. Clinicians need to consider 
pathogen-specific thresholds when intervene on platelet count.

Plain Language Summary: This study validated the differential incidence of 
thrombocytopenia among various pathogens within two distinct 
populations.Candida, Escherichia, Klebsiella, and Serratia species were 
identified as having a notably higher risk of causing thrombocytopenia compared 
to other pathogens.We observed L- or U-shaped relationships between platelet 
counts and 28-day mortality in Candida species, Enterococcus species, 
Escherichia species, Enterobacter species, Staphylococcus species, and 
Klebsiella species with platelet count cutoff values of 96 × 109/L, 100 × 109/L, 
100 × 109/L, 146 × 109/L, 152 × 109/L, and 190 × 109/L, respectively.

BACKGROUND: Inflammation is related to cardiovascular disease. Among the many 
inflammatory markers, neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio (NLR), 
platelet-to-lymphocyte ratio (PLR), and systemic immune-inflammatory index (SII) 
were considered as novel predictors for atherosclerosis outcomes. We aimed to 
investigate the impact of these inflammatory markers on the prognosis of 
patients with atrial fibrillation (AF).
METHODS: We obtained data on AF patients from the Medical Information Mart for 
Intensive Care (MIMIC)-IV database. These patients were classified into two 
groups based on their survival status within 30 days. Then, they were divided 
into three groups based on the tertile of baseline NLR, PLR, and SII, 
respectively. We comprehensively explored the relationship between those 
inflammatory indicators and all-cause mortality in patients with AF by 
Kaplan-Meier analysis, multivariate Cox regression analysis, receiver operating 
characteristic (ROC) analyses, restricted cubic spline regression (RCS), and 
subgroup analysis.
RESULTS: A total of 4562 patients with AF were included. Statistically 
significant differences were found between survivor and non-survivor groups for 
NLR, PLR and SII. Patients in the high tertile of the NLR had a higher mortality 
rate than those in the low and intermediate tertiles, as did patients in the PLR 
and the SII. NLR, PLR and SII were independently associated with increased risk 
of all-cause mortality. RCS showed that the 30-day and 365-day risk of death 
were linearly associated with increases in NLR, PLR, and SII, respectively.
CONCLUSION: NLR, PLR, and SII have the potential to be used as indicators for 
stratifying the risk of mortality in critically ill patients with AF.

Our study focused on evaluating the effect of three common vasoactive drugs on 
the prognosis of elderly patients with sepsis and pre-existing heart failure. 
The Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care III database, Version 1.4, was 
used. Our study included critically ill older patients (aged ≥ 65 years) with 
sepsis and heart failure treated with vasoactive drugs. Patients were divided 
into norepinephrine group, norepinephrine combined with vasopressin group, and 
dopamine group. The baseline characteristics, primary outcome, and secondary 
outcome measures were compared among the three groups. In total, 1357 elderly 
patients were included (766 in norepinephrine group, 250 in norepinephrine 
combined with vasopressin group, and 341 in dopamine group). After propensity 
score matching, statistically significant differences in 28-d and 90-d mortality 
(P = 0.046, P = 0.031) were observed; meanwhile, there was a significant 
difference in the incidence of mechanical ventilation, AKI, and malignant 
arrhythmias. Cox regression analysis revealed that norepinephrine combined with 
vasopressin decreased 5-year survival statistically(P = 0.001). Multiple linear 
regression analysis indicated dopamine as an independent risk factor in reducing 
ICU and hospital length of stay (P = 0.001, P = 0.017). Logistic regression 
analysis showed dopamine was an independent risk factor for new-onset 
arrhythmias (P < 0.001), while norepinephrine combined with vasopressin was an 
independent risk factor for new-onset malignant arrhythmias (P < 0.001). 
Norepinephrine in combination with vasopressin decreased survival and increased 
the incidence of malignant arrhythmias in elderly sepsis patients with 
pre-existing heart failure. Dopamine alone reduces ICU and hospital length of 
stay but increases the new-onset arrhythmias.

BACKGROUND: Previous studies have shown the association of waiting time in the 
emergency department with the prognosis of critically ill patients, but these 
studies linking the waiting time to clinical outcomes have been inconsistent and 
limited by small sample size.
AIM: To determine the relationship between the waiting time in the emergency 
department and the clinical outcomes for critically ill patients in a large 
sample population.
DESIGN: A retrospective cohort study of 13 634 patients.
METHODS: We used the Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care III database. 
Multivariable logistic regression was used to determine the independent 
relationships of the in-hospital mortality rate with the delayed time and 
different groups. Interaction and stratified analysis were conducted to test 
whether the effect of delayed time differed across various subgroups.
RESULTS: After adjustments, the in-hospital mortality in the ≥6 h group 
increased by 38.1% (OR 1.381, 95% CI 1.221-1.562). Moreover, each delayed hour 
was associated independently with a 1.0% increase in the risk of in-hospital 
mortality (OR 1.010, 95% CI 1.008-1.010). In the stratified analysis, intensive 
care unit (ICU) types, length of hospital stay, length of ICU stay, simplified 
acute physiology score II and diagnostic category were found to have 
interactions with ≥6 h group in in-hospital mortality.
CONCLUSIONS: In this large retrospective cohort study, every delayed hour was 
associated with an increase in mortality. Furthermore, clinicians should be 
cautious of patients diagnosed with sepsis, liver/renal/metabolic diseases, 
internal hemorrhage and cardiovascular disease, and if conditions permit, they 
should give priority to transferring to the corresponding ICUs.

BACKGROUND: Machine learning (ML) has been used to build high performance 
prediction model. Patients with congestive heart failure (CHF) are vulnerable to 
acute kidney injury (AKI) which makes treatment difficult. We aimed to establish 
an ML-based prediction model for the early identification of AKI in patients 
with CHF.
METHODS: Patients data were extracted from the Medical Information Mart for 
Intensive Care III (MIMIC-III) database, and patients with CHF were selected. 
Comparisons between several common ML classifiers were conducted to select the 
best prediction model. Recursive feature elimination (RFE) was used to select 
important prediction features. The model was improved using hyperparameters 
optimization (HPO). The final model was validated using an external validation 
set from the eICU Collaborative Research Database. The area under the receiver 
operating characteristic curve (AUROC), accuracy, calibration curve and decision 
curve analysis were used to evaluate prediction performance. Additionally, the 
final model was used to predict renal replacement therapy (RRT) requirement and 
to assess the short-term prognosis of patients with CHF. Finally, a software 
program was developed based on the selected features, which could intuitively 
report the probability of AKI.
RESULTS: A total of 8,580 patients with CHF were included, among whom 2,364 were 
diagnosed with AKI. The LightGBM model showed the best prediction performance 
(AUROC = 0.803) among the 13 ML-based models. After RFE and HPO, the final model 
was established with 18 features including serum creatinine (SCr), blood urea 
nitrogen (BUN) and urine output (UO). The prediction performance of LightGBM was 
better than that of measuring SCr, UO or SCr combined with UO (AUROCs: 0.809, 
0.703, 0.560 and 0.714, respectively). Additionally, the final model could 
accurately predict RRT requirement in patients with (AUROC = 0.954). Moreover, 
the participants were divided into high- and low-risk groups for AKI, and the 
90-day mortality in the high-risk group was significantly higher than that in 
the low-risk group (log-rank p < 0.001). Finally, external validation using the 
eICU database comprising 9,749 patients with CHF revealed satisfactory 
prediction outcomes (AUROC = 0.816).
CONCLUSION: A prediction model for AKI in patients with CHF was established 
based on LightGBM, and the prediction performance of this model was better than 
that of other models. This model may help in predicting RRT requirement and in 
identifying the population with poor prognosis among patients with CHF.

BACKGROUND: Acute pancreatitis (AP) is a complex and heterogeneous disease. We 
aimed to design and validate a prognostic nomogram for improving the prediction 
of short-term survival in patients with AP.
METHODS: The clinical data of 632 patients with AP were obtained from the 
Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care (MIMIC)-IV database. The nomogram 
for the prediction of 30-day, 60-day and 90-day survival was developed by 
incorporating the risk factors identified by multivariate Cox analyses.
RESULTS: Multivariate Cox proportional hazard model analysis showed that age 
(hazard ratio [HR]=1.06, 95% confidence interval [95% CI] 1.03-1.08, P<0.001), 
white blood cell count (HR=1.03, 95% CI 1.00-1.06, P=0.046), systolic blood 
pressure (HR=0.99, 95% CI 0.97-1.00, P=0.015), serum lactate level (HR=1.10, 95% 
CI 1.01-1.20, P=0.023), and Simplified Acute Physiology Score II (HR=1.04, 95% 
CI 1.02-1.06, P<0.001) were independent predictors of 90-day mortality in 
patients with AP. A prognostic nomogram model for 30-day, 60-day, and 90-day 
survival based on these variables was built. Receiver operating characteristic 
(ROC) curve analysis demonstrated that the nomogram had good accuracy for 
predicting 30-day, 60-day, and 90-day survival (area under the ROC curve: 0.796, 
0.812, and 0.854, respectively; bootstrap-corrected C-index value: 0.782, 0.799, 
and 0.846, respectively).
CONCLUSION: The nomogram-based prognostic model was able to accurately predict 
30-day, 60-day, and 90-day survival outcomes and thus may be of value for risk 
stratification and clinical decision-making for critically ill patients with AP.

BACKGROUND: The incidence and mortality of cardiac arrest (CA) is high. We 
developed interpretable machine learning models for early prediction of ICU 
mortality risk in patients diagnosed with CA.
METHODS: Data from the Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care (MIMIC-IV, 
version 2.2) was randomized to training set (0.7) and internal validation set 
(0.3), and data from eICU(version 2.0.1) was used as external validation set. 
Five models including Logistic Regression (LR), Random Forest (RF), K Nearest 
Neighbor (KNN), Decision Tree (DT), and Extreme Gradient Boost (XGBoost) were 
developed. The model with the largest area under the Receiver Operating 
Characteristic (ROC) curve (AUC) and good performance in other features was 
defined as the best model, and Shapley Additive Explanations (SHAP) was used to 
improve the interpretability of the optimal model.
RESULTS: A total of 1088 patients from MIMIC-IV, and 3542 patients from eICU 
were included. Seven variables were selected to construct models by Least 
Absolute Shrinkage and Selection Operator (LASSO) regression. The RF model was 
the best predictive model with AUC and 95% CI at 0.83 (0.78-0.88) in internal 
validation set, and 0.71(0.68-0.74) in external validation set. SHAP analysis 
found that the variables that had a high impact on the risk of ICU death were 
minimal Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS), base excess, anion gap, and urine output.
CONCLUSION: RF is the optimal model for predicting the risk of ICU death in CA 
patients. The development of this model is important for early identification 
and intervention of CA patients who are at risk of dying in the ICU.

OBJECTIVE: This retrospective study aimed to explore the association and 
clinical value of sequential organ failure assessment (SOFA) score on the 
predictors of adverse events in patients with unruptured abdominal aortic 
aneurysms (AAA).
METHODS: A total of 322 patients from Medical Information Mart for Intensive 
Care IV database were enrolled. Logistic regression was conducted to explore the 
association between SOFA and primary outcome (need for surgery, NFS). Receiver 
operating characteristic (ROC) and nomogram analyses were used to assess its 
performance for predicting NFS. We also explored the association and clinical 
value of SOFA on secondary outcomes including hospital length of stay (LOS), 
ICU-LOS, and in-hospital mortality by linear and logistic regression analyses, 
generalized additive model, ROC, and decision curve analysis.
RESULTS: Totally 291 patients underwent the surgery. High SOFA score 
significantly correlated with NFS both in crude and adjusted models (all 
P<0.05). SOFA had a relatively favorable prediction performance on NFS (AUC = 
0.701, 95%CI: 0.596-0.802). After adjusting for related diseases, its prediction 
performance was increased. When SOFA was combined with lactate and gender, the 
model showed an AUC of 0.888 (95%CI: 0.759-1.000) and 0.3-0.9 prediction 
possibility. Further, the SOFA also showed significant relationship with 
hospital-LOS, ICU-LOS, and in-hospital mortality (all P<0.05), and exerted some 
value in the prediction of 7-day hospital-LOS (AUC = 0.637, 95%CI: 0.575-0.686) 
and in-hospital mortality (AUC = 0.637, 95%CI: 0.680-0.845).
CONCLUSIONS: SOFA score was related to the NFS and can be regarded as a useful 
indicator for predicting the NFS in patients with AAA.

BACKGROUND: Liver cirrhosis patients admitted to intensive care unit (ICU) have 
a high mortality rate.
AIM: To establish and validate a nomogram for predicting in-hospital mortality 
of ICU patients with liver cirrhosis.
METHODS: We extracted demographic, etiological, vital sign, laboratory test, 
comorbidity, complication, treatment, and severity score data of liver cirrhosis 
patients from the Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care IV (MIMIC-IV) and 
electronic ICU (eICU) collaborative research database (eICU-CRD). Predictor 
selection and model building were based on the MIMIC-IV dataset. The variables 
selected through least absolute shrinkage and selection operator analysis were 
further screened through multivariate regression analysis to obtain final 
predictors. The final predictors were included in the multivariate logistic 
regression model, which was used to construct a nomogram. Finally, we conducted 
external validation using the eICU-CRD. The area under the receiver operating 
characteristic curve (AUC), decision curve, and calibration curve were used to 
assess the efficacy of the models.
RESULTS: Risk factors, including the mean respiratory rate, mean systolic blood 
pressure, mean heart rate, white blood cells, international normalized ratio, 
total bilirubin, age, invasive ventilation, vasopressor use, maximum stage of 
acute kidney injury, and sequential organ failure assessment score, were 
included in the multivariate logistic regression. The model achieved AUCs of 
0.864 and 0.808 in the MIMIC-IV and eICU-CRD databases, respectively. The 
calibration curve also confirmed the predictive ability of the model, while the 
decision curve confirmed its clinical value.
CONCLUSION: The nomogram has high accuracy in predicting in-hospital mortality. 
Improving the included predictors may help improve the prognosis of patients.

BACKGROUND: Early prediction of acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) of 
critically ill patients in intensive care units (ICUs) has been intensively 
studied in the past years. Yet a prediction model trained on data from one 
hospital might not be well generalized to other hospitals. It is therefore 
essential to develop an accurate and generalizable ARDS prediction model 
adaptive to different hospital or medical centers.
METHODS: We analyzed electronic medical records of 200,859 and 50,920 
hospitalized patients within 24 h after being diagnosed with ARDS from the 
Philips eICU Institute (eICU-CRD) and the Medical Information Mart for Intensive 
Care (MIMIC-IV) dataset, respectively. Patients were sorted into three groups, 
including rapid death, long stay, and recovery, based on their condition or 
outcome between 24 and 72 h after ARDS diagnosis. To improve prediction 
performance and generalizability, a "pretrain-finetune" approach was applied, 
where we pretrained models on the eICU-CRD dataset and performed model 
finetuning using only a part (35%) of the MIMIC-IV dataset, and then tested the 
finetuned models on the remaining data from the MIMIC-IV dataset. Well-known 
machine-learning algorithms, including logistic regression, random forest, 
extreme gradient boosting, and multilayer perceptron neural networks, were 
employed to predict ARDS outcomes. Prediction performance was evaluated using 
the area under the receiver-operating characteristic curve (AUC).
RESULTS: Results show that, in general, multilayer perceptron neural networks 
outperformed the other models. The use of pretrain-finetune yielded improved 
performance in predicting ARDS outcomes achieving a micro-AUC of 0.870 for the 
MIMIC-IV dataset, an improvement of 0.046 over the pretrain model.
CONCLUSIONS: The proposed pretrain-finetune approach can effectively improve 
model generalizability from one to another dataset in ARDS prediction.

BACKGROUND: The serum albumin creatinine ratio (sACR) has been established as a 
potential indicator for heart disease, however, its relationship with prognosis 
in intensive care unit (ICU) patients with heart failure remains uncertain. This 
study aimed to investigate the association between sACR levels and all-cause 
mortality ICU patients with heart failure.
METHODS: Clinical data from MIMIC-Ⅳ database was utilized for the analysis of 
ICU patients with heart failure. Patients were categorized into quartiles 
(Q1-Q4) based on sACR levels. Kaplan-Meier survival analysis and multivariate 
adjusted Cox regression models were employed to assess the association between 
sACR levels and mortality outcomes within 365 days. Subgroup analysis was used 
to evaluate the prognostic impact of sACR across diverse populations. Restricted 
cubic spline curves and threshold effect analysis were utilized to quantify the 
dose-response relationship between sACR levels and risk of all-cause mortality. 
Mediating effects analysis was conducted to present the involvement of albumin 
and creatinine in the association between sACR and outcomes.
RESULTS: The analysis encompassed a cohort of 4,506 patients, with Kaplan-Meier 
curves indicating that individuals with lower sACR levels exhibited an elevated 
risk of all-cause mortality (log-rank p < 0.001). Multivariate adjusted Cox 
regression and subgroup analysis demonstrated that individuals in Q2 [hazard 
ratio (HR) 0.82, 95%CI 0.71∼0.96], Q3 (HR 0.76, 95%CI 0.64∼0.91) and Q4 (HR 
0.62, 95%CI 0.50∼0.76) had a decreased risk of mortality compared to individuals 
in Q1 (lower levels of sACR) (p for trend < 0.001), and this inverse 
relationship was consistently observed across various subgroups. Subsequent 
restricted cubic spline analysis revealed a negative yet nonlinear relationship 
between sACR and all-cause mortality (p for nonlinear < 0.001), and threshold 
effect analysis indicated an effect threshold of 3.75. Additionally, mediating 
effects analysis emphasized that sACR influenced the outcome not only through 
serum albumin and creatinine pathways, but also through direct mechanisms.
CONCLUSION: The study found that low levels of sACR were independently 
associated with an increased risk of one-year all-cause mortality in ICU 
patients with heart failure, with a threshold effect, which could potentially 
serve as an early warning indicator for high-risk populations.

BACKGROUND: Sepsis is a life-threatening disease accompanied by disorders of the 
coagulation and immune systems. P2Y12 inhibitors, widely used for arterial 
thrombosis prevention and treatment, possess recently discovered 
anti-inflammatory properties, raising potential for improved sepsis prognosis.
METHOD: We conducted a retrospective analysis using the data from Medical 
Information Mart for Intensive Care-IV database. Patients were divided into an 
aspirin-alone group versus a combination group based on the use of a P2Y12 
inhibitor or not. Differences in 30-day mortality, length of stay (LOS) in 
intensive care unit (ICU), LOS in hospital, bleeding events and thrombotic 
events were compared between the two groups.
RESULT: A total of 1701 pairs of matched patients were obtained by propensity 
score matching. We found that no statistically significant difference in 30-day 
mortality in aspirin-alone group and combination group (15.3% vs. 13.7%, 
log-rank p = 0.154). In addition, patients received P2Y12 inhibitors had a 
higher incidence of gastrointestinal bleeding (0.5% vs. 1.6%, p = 0.004) and 
ischemic stroke (1.7% vs. 2.9%, p = 0.023), despite having a shorter LOS in 
hospital (11.1 vs. 10.3, days, p = 0.043). Cox regression showed that P2Y12 
inhibitor was not associated with 30-day mortality (HR = 1.14, 95% CI 0.95-1.36, 
p = 0.154).
CONCLUSION: P2Y12 inhibitors did not provide a survival benefit for patients 
with sepsis 3 and even led to additional adverse clinical outcomes.

BACKGROUND: Hypochloremia and red blood cell distribution width (RDW) play 
important roles in congestive heart failure (CHF) pathophysiology, and they were 
associated with the prognosis of CHF. However, the prognostic value of chloride 
combined with RDW in patients with CHF remains unknown.
METHODS: We retrospectively analyzed critically ill patients with CHF. The 
database was derived from the Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care IV 
v2.0 (MIMIC-IV-v2.0) database.
RESULTS: In the final analysis, 5376 critically ill patients with CHF were 
included, and 2428 patients (45.2 %) experienced 5-year mortality. The 
restricted cubic spline model revealed a positive correlation between RDW and 
5-year mortality, whereas chloride showed a U-shaped correlation with 5-year 
mortality. The median values of RDW and chloride were used to classify patients 
into four groups: high chloride/low RDW, low chloride/low RDW, high 
chloride/high RDW, and low chloride/high RDW. We observed the prognostic value 
of RDW combined with chloride in the Cox proportional hazard model, in 
predicting 5-year mortality, in-hospital mortality and 1-year mortality. 
Furthermore, we discovered that patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD) had a 
higher 5-year mortality risk than patients without CKD.
CONCLUSION: We found the translational potential role of chloride combined with 
RDW in prioritizing patients at high risk for short- and long-term mortality in 
a cohort of critically ill patients with CHF. Prospective multicenter 
investigations are warranted to validate our results.

BACKGROUND: The mortality rate is high in patients with acute kidney injury 
(AKI). Hyperglycemia and hypoglycemia alone can increase the morbidity and 
mortality of patients with AKI. Up to now, no relevant studies have analyzed the 
relationship between different blood glucose levels and mortality in AKI 
patients. Therefore, exploring the relationship between baseline blood glucose 
level and 30-day mortality in patients with AKI can provide early warning 
information for disease prognosis and provide reference basis for reasonable 
level of blood glucose control.
METHODS: This retrospective cohort study was obtained from the Medical 
Information Mart for Intensive Care III (MIMIC-III) database. Patients had 
experienced AKI within 48 hours of admission. AKI was diagnosed according to the 
Kidney Disease: Improving Global Outcomes (KDIGO) guidelines. Data on patients' 
baseline blood glucose level on admission was retrieved, and the outcome 
indicator was 30-day mortality. A multivariate Cox regression analysis and 
smoothed curve fitting were used to assess the relationship between the baseline 
blood glucose level and 30-day mortality. The covariates used for adjustment 
were those in the patient's baseline data.
RESULTS: A total of 14,449 AKI patients were screened. The overall 30-day 
mortality rate was 17.6%. Patients with blood glucose levels of 6.36-7.35 mmol/L 
on admission had the lowest 30-day mortality risk. The multivariate Cox 
regression model and smoothed curve fitting revealed a U-shaped relationship 
between the baseline blood glucose level and 30-day mortality after adjusting 
all the covariables of the baseline data. The inflection point occurred at 5.52 
mmol/L. The effect size was 0.773 [hazards ratio (HR) =0.773; 95% confidence 
interval (CI): 0.614-0.975, P=0.030] on the left side of the inflection point, 
and 1.077 (HR =1.077; 95% CI: 1.059-1.097, P<0.001) on the right side.
CONCLUSIONS: The blood glucose of patients with AKI should be controlled at a 
reasonable level and should not be lower than 5.52 mmol/L, and the optimal 
control level needs further study. The limitation of this study is that there 
are some confounding factors in the retrospective study.

BACKGROUND: Acetaminophen is a commonly used analgesic after surgery, and its 
impact on prognosis in patients with acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) 
has not been studied. This study explores the association between the use of 
acetaminophen and the risk of mortality in patients with ARDS.
METHODS: In this retrospective cohort study, 3,227 patients with ARDS who had or 
had not received acetaminophen were obtained from the Medical Information Mart 
for Intensive Care IV, patients were divided into acetaminophen and non- 
acetaminophen groups. In-hospital mortality of ARDS patients was considered as 
primary end point. We used univariate and multivariate Cox regression analyses 
to assess the relationship of acetaminophen use and in-hospital mortality in 
patients with ARDS. Subgroup analysis was performed according to age, gender, 
and severity of ARDS.
RESULTS: Of the total patients, 2,438 individuals were identified as 
acetaminophen users. The median duration of follow-up was 10.54 (5.57, 18.82) 
days. The results showed that the acetaminophen use was associated with a 
decreased risk of in-hospital mortality [hazard ratio (HR) = 0.67, 95% 
confidence interval (CI): 0.57-0.78]. Across various subgroups of patients with 
ARDS based on age, gender, and severity, acetaminophen use exhibited an 
association with reduced risk of in-hospital mortality.
CONCLUSION: Acetaminophen use was associated with in-hospital mortality of 
patients with ARDS. Acetaminophen therapy may represent a promising therapeutic 
option for ARDS patients and warrants further investigation.

Consider that inflammatory factors are associated with short-term mortality in 
patients with acute myocardial infarction (AMI). In this retrospective analysis 
of 2,784 AMI patients from the Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care-IV 
database, we evaluated the impact of inflammatory markers on in-hospital 
mortality and predicted 30-day and 90-day outcomes. Patients were divided into 
groups based on in-hospital survival (n = 2,364) and mortality (n = 420). 
Analysis of initial hospital admission laboratory data, including inflammatory 
factors, revealed these factors as independent predictors of in-hospital 
mortality (Q4 of RDW: OR 1.96, NLR: OR 1.63, SII: OR 1.85, and SIRI: OR 2.23, 
all P < 0.05). Cox proportional hazards models confirmed their significance for 
predicting 30-day (Q4 of NLR: OR 1.83, SII: OR 1.86, and SIRI: OR 2.01, all P < 
0.05) and 90-day mortality (Q4 of RDW: OR 1.46, NLR: OR 1.69, SII: OR 1.73, and 
SIRI: OR 1.72, all P < 0.05). Increasing levels of inflammatory markers 
correlated with higher odds and hazard ratios, as illustrated by Restricted 
Cubic Spline curves. Kaplan-Meier survival analysis showed better survival rates 
with lower inflammatory marker levels. Receiver operating characteristic curves 
demonstrated good predictive performance of individual inflammatory factors, 
with a new composite marker showing the highest predictive ability (AUC = 
0.720). This study underscores the association of inflammatory factors with both 
hospital and short-term mortality in AMI patients.

BACKGROUND: Serum lactate dehydrogenase to albumin ratio (LAR) is associated 
with poor outcomes in malignancy and pneumonia. However, there are few studies 
suggesting that LAR is associated with the occurrence of acute kidney injury 
(AKI) in patients with sepsis, which was investigated in this study.
METHODS: We conducted a retrospective cohort study based on the Medical 
Information Mart for Intensive Care (MIMIC)-IV database. The primary outcome was 
the occurrence of AKI within 2 days and 7 days. Multivariable logistic 
regression models were used to calculate odds ratios to validate the association 
between LAR and AKI, in-hospital mortality, RRT use, and recovery of renal 
function, respectively.
RESULTS: A total of 4010 participants were included in this study. The median 
age of the participants was 63.5 years and the median LAR was 10.5. After 
adjusting for confounding variables, patients in the highest LAR quartile had a 
higher risk of AKI than those in the lowest LAR quartile within 2 days and 
7 days, with odds ratios of 1.37 (95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.23-1.52) and 
1.95 (95% CI: 1.72-2.22), respectively. The adjusted odds of AKI within 2 and 
7 days were 1.16 (95% CI: 1.12-1.20) and 1.29 (95% CI: 1.24-1.35) for each 
1 unit increase in LAR(log2), respectively.
CONCLUSION: This study demonstrated that elevated LAR was associated with poor 
prognosis in patients with sepsis. The risk of AKI and in-hospital mortality 
increased, the need for RRT increased, and the chance of recovery of renal 
function decreased with the increase of LAR.

BACKGROUND: Ventilator associated pneumonia (VAP) is a common complication and 
associated with poor prognosis of traumatic brain injury (TBI) patients.
OBJECTIVES: This study was conducted to explore the predictive performance of 
different machine-learning algorithms for VAP in TBI patients.
METHODS: TBI patients receiving mechanical ventilation more than 48 hours from 
the Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care-III (MIMIC-III) database were 
eligible for the study. The VAP was confirmed based on the ICD-9 code. Included 
patients were separated to the training cohort and the validation cohort with a 
ratio of 7:3. Predictive models based on different machine learning algorithms 
were developed using 5-fold cross validation in the training cohort and then 
verified in the validation cohort by evaluating the area under the receiver 
operating characteristic curve (AUC), sensitivity, specificity, accuracy and F 
score.
RESULTS: 786 TBI patients from the MIMIC-III were finally included with the VAP 
incidence of 44.0%. The random forest performed the best on predicting VAP in 
the training cohort with a AUC of 1.000. The XGBoost and AdaBoost were ranked 
the second and the third with a AUC of 0.915 and 0.789 in the training cohort. 
While the AdaBoost performed the best on predicting VAP in the validation cohort 
with a AUC of 0.706. The XGBoost and random forest were ranked the second and 
the third with the AUC of 0.685 and 0.683 in the validation cohort. Generally, 
the random forest and XGBoost were likely to be over-fitting while the AdaBoost 
was relatively stable in predicting the VAP.
CONCLUSIONS: The AdaBoost performed well and stably on predicting the VAP in TBI 
patients. Developing programs using AdaBoost in portable electronic devices may 
effectively assist physicians in assessing the risk of VAP in TBI.

BACKGROUND: Red blood cell distribution width (RDW) is highly associated with 
adverse clinical outcomes in many diseases. The present study aimed to evaluate 
the relationship between RDW and gastrointestinal bleeding (GIB) after isolated 
coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG).
METHODS: This was a retrospective observational study that included 4473 
patients who received CABG, and all the data were extracted from the Medical 
Information Mart for Intensive Care III database. Data collected included 
patient demographics, associated comorbid illnesses, laboratory parameters, and 
medications. The receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve was used to 
determine the best cutoff value of RDW for the diagnosis of GIB. Multivariable 
logistic regression analysis was used to analyze the relationship between RDW 
and GIB.
RESULTS: The incidence of GIB in patients receiving CABG was 1.1%. Quartile 
analyses showed a significant increase in GIB incidence at the fourth RDW 
quartile (> 14.3%; P < 0.001). The ROC curve analysis revealed that an RDW 
level > 14.1% measured on admission had 59.6% sensitivity and 69.4% specificity 
in predicting GIB after CABG. After adjustment for confounders, high RDW was 
still associated with an increased risk of GIB in patients with CABG (odds 
ratio = 2.83, 95% confidence interval 1.46-5.51, P = 0.002).
CONCLUSIONS: Our study indicates that the elevated RDW level is associated with 
an increased risk of GIB after CABG, and it can be an independent predictor of 
GIB. The introduction of RDW to study GIB enriches the diagnosis method of GIB 
and ensures the rapid and accurate diagnosis of GIB.

BACKGROUND: Insulin resistance (IR) is closely related to the development of 
cardiovascular diseases. Triglyceride-glucose-body mass index (TyG-BMI) has been 
proven to be a reliable surrogate of IR, but the relationship between TyG-BMI 
and acute myocardial infarction (AMI) is unknown. The present study aims to 
determine the effects of TyG-BMI on the clinical prognosis of critically ill 
patients with AMI.
METHODS: The data of AMI patients were extracted from the Medical Information 
Mart for Intensive Care IV (MIMIC-IV) database. All patients were divided into 
four groups according to the TyG-BMI quartile. Outcomes were defined as 30-, 
90-, 180-, and 365-day all-cause mortality. Kaplan-Meier (K-M) curve was used to 
compare survival rate between groups. Meanwhile, Cox regression analysis and 
restricted cubic splines (RCS) were used to explore the relationship between 
TyG-BMI index and outcome events.
RESULTS: A total of 1,188 critically ill patients with AMI were included in this 
study. They were divided into four groups according to TyG-BMI quartiles, there 
were significant differences in 90-, 180-, and 365-day all-cause mortality while 
there was no difference in 30-day all-cause mortality. Interestingly, with the 
increase of TyG-BMI, the 90-, 180-, and 365-day survival rate increased first 
and then gradually decreased, but the survival rate after decreasing was still 
higher than that in the group with the lowest TyG-BMI. U-shaped relationships 
between TyG-BMI index and 90-, 180-, and 365-day all-cause mortality were 
identified using RCS curve and the inflection point was 311.1, 316.5, and 320.1, 
respectively, whereas the TyG-BMI index was not non-linearly associated with 
30-day all-cause mortality. The results of Cox proportional hazard regression 
analysis are consistent with those of RCS analysis.
CONCLUSION: U-shaped relationships are existed between the TyG-BMI index and 
90-, 180-, and 365-day all-cause mortality in critically ill patients with AMI, 
but not 30-day all-cause mortality. The TyG-BMI index can be used as an 
effective index for early prevention of critically ill patients with AMI.

BACKGROUND: Volume resuscitation is often required in critically ill patients. 
However, we have no clear consensus on the choice between crystalloid solution 
and colloidal solution. This study aimed to explore the effect of albumin 
administration in massive fluid resuscitation.
METHODS: This was a retrospective cohort study based on the Medical Information 
Mart for Intensive Care IV (MIMIC-IV) database (2008 and 2019). The prognosis of 
patients receiving albumin in combination with crystalloids and those receiving 
crystalloids alone was compared to assess the benefits of albumin in fluid 
resuscitation.
RESULTS: 4426 patients received crystalloids alone (crystalloids group), 692 
patients received albumin in combination with crystalloids within the first 24 h 
of initiation of crystalloids (early albumin combination group), and 382 
patients received albumin after the first 24 h (late albumin combination group). 
Patients in early albumin combination group were more severe than those in 
Crystalloids group. Nevertheless, we found no statistically significant 
difference in mortality between the two groups. Multivariate logistic regression 
analysis using the propensity-score matched cohort showed that the 28-day and 
60-day mortality in the early albumin combination group were lower than those in 
the crystalloids group (odds ratio: 0.64 [95% CI 0.50-0.82; P < 0.001] and 0.71 
[95% CI 0.56-0.90; P = 0.004], respectively. Patients in early albumin 
combination group lived, on average, 1.16 days (95% CI 0.33-2.00; P < 0.01) and 
3.3 days (95% CI 1.15-5.44; P < 0.01) longer than the crystalloids group during 
28-day follow-up and 60-day follow-up.
CONCLUSION: Administration of albumin within 24 h after the initiation of 
crystalloids was associated with a lower mortality and a longer restricted mean 
survival time during 28-day follow-up and 60-day follow-up compared with 
crystalloid infusion alone. However, administration of albumin 24 h after the 
initiation of crystalloids was not associated with better prognosis compared to 
crystalloid infusion alone.

INTRODUCTION: The geriatric nutritional risk index (GNRI), a nutritional 
screening tool specifically for the aging population, has been proven to be 
associated with worse outcomes in chronic kidney disease patients, especially in 
the hemodialysis population. However, the predictive validity of GNRI in 
critically ill elderly patients with acute kidney injury (AKI) is yet to be 
determined. This analysis sought to examine the prognostic effects of GNRI on 
elderly AKI patients in intensive care units (ICUs).
METHODS: We collected elderly AKI patient-relevant data from the Medical 
Information Mart for Intensive Care III database. AKI was diagnosed and staged 
according to the "Kidney Disease Improving Global Outcomes" criteria. In the 
study, 1-year mortality was considered the primary outcome, whereas in-hospital, 
ICU, 28-day and 90-day mortality, and prolonged length of stay in ICU and 
hospital were selected as the secondary outcomes.
RESULTS: In all, 3,501 elderly patients with AKI were selected for this study, 
with a 1-year mortality rate of 36.4%. We classified the study population into 
low (≤98) and high (>98) GNRI groups based on the best cutoff value. The 
incidence of endpoints was remarkably lower in patients with elevated GNRI (p < 
0.001). When stratified by the AKI stage, patients with high GNRI at AKI stages 
1, 2, and 3 had markedly lower 1-year mortality than those with low GNRI (all p 
< 0.05). The multivariable regression analysis identified the independent 
prognostic ability of GNRI on the research outcomes (all p < 0.05). Restricted 
cubic spline exhibited a linear correlation between GNRI and 1-year death (p for 
non-linearity = 0.434). The prognostic implication of GNRI on 1-year mortality 
was still significant in patients with the most subgroups.
CONCLUSION: In critically ill elderly patients with AKI, elevated GNRI upon 
admission was strongly correlated with a lower risk of unfavorable outcomes.

BACKGROUND: Acute kidney injury (AKI) is the most common major complication of 
cardiac surgery field. The purpose of this study is to investigate the 
association between acute kidney injury and the prognoses of cardiac surgery 
patients in the Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care III (MIMIC-III) 
database.
METHODS: Clinical data were extracted from the MIMIC-III database. Adult 
(≥18 years) cardiac surgery patients in the database were enrolled. 
Multivariable logistic regression analyses were employed to assess the 
associations between acute kidney injury (AKI) comorbidity and 30-day mortality, 
90-day mortality and hospital mortality. Different adjusting models were used to 
adjust for potential confounders.
RESULTS: A total of 6,002 patients were involved, among which 485 patients 
(8.08%) had comorbid AKI. Patients with AKI were at higher risks of prolonged 
ICU stay, hospital mortality, 90-day mortality (all P < 0.001), and 30-day 
mortality (P = 0.008). AKI was a risk factor for hospital mortality [Model 1, OR 
(95% CI) = 2.50 (1.45-4.33); Model 2, OR (95% CI) = 2.44 (1.48-4.02)], 30-day 
mortality [Model 1, OR (95% CI) = 1.84 (1.05-3.24); Model 2, OR (95% CI) = 1.96 
(1.13-3.22)] and 90-day mortality [Model 1, OR (95% CI) = 2.05 (1.37-3.01); 
Model 2, OR (95% CI) = 2.76 (1.93-3.94)]. Higher hospital mortality, 30-day 
mortality and 90-day mortality was observed in higher KDIGO grade for cardiac 
surgery patients with AKI (all P < 0.05).
CONCLUSION: Comorbid AKI increased the risk of hospital mortality, 30-day 
mortality, and 90-day mortality of cardiac surgery patients in the MIMIC-III 
database.

OBJECTIVE: Bone and bone marrow are the third most frequent sites of metastases 
from many cancers and are associated with low survival and high morbidity rates. 
Currently, there are no effective bedside tools to predict the morbidity risk of 
these patients in general intensive care units (ICUs). The main objective of 
this study was to establish and validate a nomogram to predict the morbidity 
risk of patients with bone and bone marrow metastases.
METHODS: Data on patients with bone and bone marrow metastases were extracted 
from the Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care III (MIMIC-III) database. 
The patients were divided into training and validation cohorts. The data were 
analyzed using univariate and multivariate Cox regression methods. Factors 
significantly and independently prognostic of survival were used to construct a 
nomogram predicting 30-day morbidity. The nomogram was validated by various 
methods, including Harrell's concordance index (C-index), area under the 
receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC), calibration curve, integrated 
discrimination improvement (IDI), net reclassification index (NRI), and decision 
curve analysis (DCA).
RESULTS: The study included 610 patients in the training cohort and 262 in the 
validation cohort. Multivariate Cox regression analysis showed that temperature, 
SpO2, Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (SOFA) score, Oxford Acute Severity of 
Illness Score (OASIS), comorbidities with coagulopathy, white blood cell count, 
heart rate, and respiratory rate were independent predictors of patient 
survival. The resulting nomogram had good discriminative ability, as shown by 
high AUCs, and was well calibrated, as demonstrated by calibration curves. 
Improvements in NRI and IDI values suggested that the nomogram was superior to 
the SOFA scoring system. DCA curves revealed that the nomogram showed good value 
in clinical applications.
CONCLUSION: This prognostic nomogram, based on demographic and laboratory 
parameters, was predictive of the 30-day morbidity rate in patients with 
secondary malignant neoplasms of the bone and bone marrow, suggesting its 
applicability in clinical practice.

OBJECTIVE: To investigate the relationship between the changes of immune indexes 
and prognosis in patients with sepsis.
METHODS: Based on the hospitalization information from 2008 to 2019 in the 
American Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care-IV v2.0 (MIMIC-IV v2.0), 
the hospitalized data including CD3 count, CD4 count, CD8 count, CD4/CD8 ratio, 
immunoglobulins (IgA, IgG, IgM) levels and lymphocyte counts, gender, age, body 
mass index (BMI), sequential organ failure assessment (SOFA), and prognosis of 
patients with coronary heart disease, hypertension, diabetes mellitus, 
underlying diseases, and 28-day prognosis were collected. The immunological 
indexes affecting the prognosis of patients with sepsis were compared and 
analyzed. The receiver operator characteristic curve (ROC curve) was drawn to 
analyze the value of immunological indexes in predicting the 28-day prognosis of 
patients with sepsis.
RESULTS: A total of 33 745 patients were enrolled in the study, including 1 509 
cases of sepsis and 32 236 cases without sepsis. Among the patients with sepsis, 
there were 1 084 cases alive and 425 cases died within 28 days. BMI (kg/m2: 
33.25±28.71 vs. 28.90±15.28) and IgA levels within 3 days and 7 days after 
admission in sepsis group were significantly higher than those in the non-sepsis 
group [within 3 days after admission: (275.01±216.96) mg/L vs. (85.99±75.76) 
mg/L; within 7 days after admission: (275.01±216.96) mg/L vs. (85.99±75.76) 
mg/L, all P < 0.05]. CD3 count, CD8 count within 3 days and 7 days after 
admission in sepsis group were significantly lower than that in the non-sepsis 
group [within 3 days after admission: CD3 counts were (1 080.74±849.23)/μL vs. 
(1 242.91±889.24)/μL, CD8 counts were (558.07±368.77)/μL vs. (625.07±529.66)/μL; 
within 7 days after admission: CD3 counts were (1 079.69±850.61)/μL vs. (1 
242.48±889.23)/μL, CD8 counts were (556.70±467.23)/μL vs. (624.93±429.78)/μL, 
all P < 0.05]. The proportion of patients with hypertension, diabetes and 
coronary heart disease were significantly higher than those in the non-sepsis 
group [hypertension: 10.07% (152/1 509) vs. 2.47% (796/32 236), diabetes: 50.10% 
(756/1 509) vs.15.18% (4 895/32 236), coronary heart disease: 31.21% (471/1 509) 
vs. 19.19% (6 186/32 236), all P < 0.05]. In the sepsis group, the CD3 count, 
CD4 count and CD4/CD8 ratio in the survival group were significantly higher than 
those in the death group within 3 days and 7 days after admission [within 3 days 
after admission: CD3 counts were (1 127.20±857.14)/μL vs. (938.26±810.50)/μL, 
CD4 counts were (559.76±507.18)/μL vs. (338.75±267.11)/μL, CD4/CD8 ratios were 
1.87±0.80 vs. 1.02±0.12; within 7 days after admission: CD3 count were (1 
124.01±810.53)/μL vs. (943.78±808.21)/μL, CD4 count were (559.56±507.36)/μL vs. 
(341.95±266.56)/μL, CD4/CD8 ratios were 1.88±0.79 vs. 1.03±0.13, all P < 0.05]. 
The area under the ROC curve (AUC) of CD4/CD8 ratio within 3 days after 
admission in predicting the prognosis of septic patients at 28 days was 0.615 
[95% confidence interval (95%CI) was 0.555-0.671], the sensitivity was 70.83%, 
and the specificity was 52.49%.
CONCLUSIONS: Hypertension, coronary heart disease and diabetes are more likely 
to induce sepsis. The changes of immune indexes in patients with sepsis will 
occur in the early stage. Early CD4/CD8 index can predict the prognosis of 
patients with sepsis to a certain extent.

BACKGROUND: Among critically ill patients, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease 
(COPD) is an independent risk factor for death. Recently, biomarkers such as 
neutrophil-lymphocyte ratio (NLR) and albumin (ALB) have been used to predict 
the prognosis in patients with COPD. However, the association between NLR/ALB 
and all-cause mortality in critically ill COPD patients remains unclear. This 
study aims to explore the association between the NLR/ALB and prognosis in 
critically ill patients with COPD.
METHODS: Data was sourced from the Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care 
IV (MIMIC-IV) database. Primary outcome was 28-day all-cause mortality, with 
secondary outcomes being in-hospital and 90-day all-cause mortality. The area 
under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUROC) was calculated to 
compare prognostic accuracy of NLR, NLR/ALB, PLR, SII and MLR variables. After 
identifying the most predictive factor, KM survival curves, Cox models and 
subgroup analyses were used to examine NLR/ALB's relationship with mortality in 
critically ill COPD patients. Additionally, patients with COPD from the National 
Health and Nutrition Examination Survey data (1999-2018) was used with Cox 
regression to investigate NLR/ALB's correlation with all-cause mortality in COPD 
patients.
RESULTS: 1916 critically ill COPD patients from MIMIC IV, divided into quartiles 
by NLR/ALB levels: Q1 (NLR/ALB<1.108), Q2 (2.095>NLR/ALB≥1.108), Q3 
(4.221>NLR/ALB≥2.095), Q4 (NLR/ALB≥4.221). In multivariate Cox regression, Q4 vs 
Q1: 28-day mortality HR=2.27 (95% CI: 1.63-3.16); 90-day mortality HR=2.06 (95% 
CI: 1.56-2.71); in-hospital mortality HR=1.93 (95% CI: 1.35-2.77); P<0.001. 
Subgroup analyses showed that the correlation between NLR/ALB and 28-day 
mortality was stable Additionally, we recruited 2,003 COPD patients from the 
NHANES that found NLR/ALB also correlated with all-cause mortality in COPD (In 
multivariate Cox regression: Q4 vs Q1 hR=1.92 (95% CI: 1.45-2.55, P<0.001)).
CONCLUSION: Elevated NLR/ALB levels are associated with increased all-cause 
mortality in critically ill patients with COPD.

AIM: Septic older adults represent a vulnerable population with high mortality 
rates. Base excess (BE), an indicator of acid-base status, may serve as a 
prognostic marker in sepsis. This study aimed to investigate the association 
between BE and mortality in septic older adults.
METHODS: A retrospective analysis included septic older adults (age ≥ 65 years) 
from the Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care (MIMIC)-IV database. The 
primary outcome was 30-day mortality. Multivariate Cox regression models and 
Kaplan-Meier analysis were used to assess the association between BE and 30-day 
mortality. A two-segment linear regression model with smooth curve fitting was 
employed to examine threshold effects of BE on clinical outcomes.
RESULTS: The study comprised 7379 participants, with a 21.8% 30-day mortality 
rate and an 18.6% in-hospital mortality rate. A nonlinear, U-shaped relationship 
(P < 0.001) was observed between BE and 30-day mortality in septic older adults, 
indicating increased risk with higher or lower BE levels. Various BE groups 
showed different hazard ratios for mortality: 2.7 (2.26-3.22), 1.86 (1.65-2.09), 
1.41 (1.19-1.67), and 1.9 (1.4-2.58), respectively, compared with the reference 
group (-3 mEq/L ≤ BE < 3 mEq/L). The inflection point was calculated as 
0.5 mEq/L.
CONCLUSIONS: Our findings suggest a U-shaped relationship between BE and 
mortality in septic older adults, emphasizing the importance of monitoring 
acid-base status in sepsis management for this population. Geriatr Gerontol Int 
2025; 25: 380-386.

Background: During the acute heart failure (AHF), acute kidney injury (AKI) is 
highly prevalent in critically ill patients. The occurrence of the latter 
condition increases the risk of mortality in patients with acute heart failure. 
The current research on the relationship between nutritional risk and the 
occurrence of acute kidney injury in patients with acute heart failure is very 
limited. Methods: This retrospective cohort study utilized data from the Medical 
Information Mart for Intensive Care IV (MIMIC-IV, version 2.1) database. We 
included adult patients with AHF who were admitted to the intensive care unit in 
the study. Results: A total of 1310 critically ill patients with acute heart 
failure were included. The AUC of geriatric nutritional risk index (GNRI) 
(0.694) is slightly superior to that of controlling nutritional status (CONUT) 
(0.656) and prognostic nutritional index (PNI) (0.669). The Log-rank test 
revealed a higher risk of acute kidney injury in patients with high nutritional 
risk (p < 0.001). Multivariate COX regression analysis indicated that a high 
GNRI (adjusted HR 0.62, p < 0.001) was associated with a reduced risk of AKI 
during hospitalization in AHF patients. The final subgroup analysis demonstrated 
no significant interaction of GNRI in all subgroups except for diabetes subgroup 
and ventilation subgroup (P for interaction: 0.057-0.785). Conclusion: Our study 
findings suggest a correlation between GNRI and the occurrence of acute kidney 
injury in patients hospitalized with acute heart failure.

BACKGROUND: Timely diagnosis is crucial for sepsis treatment. Current machine 
learning (ML) models suffer from high complexity and limited applicability. We 
therefore created an ML model using only complete blood count (CBC) diagnostics.
METHODS: We collected non-intensive care unit (non-ICU) data from a German 
tertiary care centre (January 2014 to December 2021). Using patient age, sex, 
and CBC parameters (haemoglobin, platelets, mean corpuscular volume, white and 
red blood cells), we trained a boosted random forest, which predicts sepsis with 
ICU admission. Two external validations were conducted using data from another 
German tertiary care centre and the Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care 
IV database (MIMIC-IV). Using the subset of laboratory orders also including 
procalcitonin (PCT), an analogous model was trained with PCT as an additional 
feature.
RESULTS: After exclusion, 1 381 358 laboratory requests (2016 from sepsis cases) 
were available. The CBC model shows an area under the receiver operating 
characteristic (AUROC) of 0.872 (95% CI, 0.857-0.887). External validations show 
AUROCs of 0.805 (95% CI, 0.787-0.824) for University Medicine Greifswald and 
0.845 (95% CI, 0.837-0.852) for MIMIC-IV. The model including PCT revealed a 
significantly higher AUROC (0.857; 95% CI, 0.836-0.877) than PCT alone (0.790; 
95% CI, 0.759-0.821; P < 0.001).
CONCLUSIONS: Our results demonstrate that routine CBC results could 
significantly improve diagnosis of sepsis when combined with ML. The CBC model 
can facilitate early sepsis prediction in non-ICU patients with high robustness 
in external validations. Its implementation in clinical decision support systems 
has strong potential to provide an essential time advantage and increase patient 
safety.

BACKGROUND: Acute kidney injury (AKI), a prevalent non-neurological complication 
following traumatic brain injury (TBI), is a major clinical issue with an 
unfavorable prognosis. This study aimed to develop and validate machine learning 
models to predict severe AKI (stage 3 or greater) incidence in patients with 
TBI.
METHODS: A retrospective cohort study was conducted by using two public 
databases: the Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care IV (MIMIC)-IV and the 
eICU Collaborative Research Database (eICU-CRD). Recursive feature elimination 
was used to select candidate predictors obtained within 24 h of intensive care 
unit admission. The area under the curve and decision curve analysis curves were 
used to determine the discriminatory ability. On the other hand, the calibration 
curve was employed to evaluate the calibrated performance of the newly developed 
machine learning models.
RESULTS: In the MIMIC-IV database, there were 808 patients diagnosed with 
moderate and severe TBI (msTBI) (msTBI is defined as Glasgow Coma Score < 12). 
Of these, 60 (7.43%) patients experienced severe AKI. External validation in the 
eICU-CRD indicated that the random forest (RF) model had the highest area under 
the curve of 0.819 (95% confidence interval 0.783-0.851). Furthermore, in the 
calibration curve, the RF model was well calibrated (P = 0.795).
CONCLUSIONS: In this study, the RF model demonstrated better discrimination in 
predicting severe AKI than other models. An online calculator could facilitate 
its application, potentially improving the early detection of severe AKI and 
subsequently improving the clinical outcomes among patients with msTBI.

OBJECTIVE: To explore the association between levels of thyroid-stimulating 
hormone (TSH) on admission and prognosis of patients admitted to intensive care 
unit (ICU).
METHODS: The data were collected from patients who were admitted to the ICU of 
the Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center in the United States from 2001 to 2012 
with available TSH test records within 24 hours after the ICU admission via the 
Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care-III v1.4 (MIMIC-III v1.4). 
Information including gender, age, ethnicity, type of admission, mechanical 
ventilation (MV) or renal replacement therapy (RRT) received on admission, 
comorbidities, and TSH test records within 24 hours after the ICU admission were 
collected. The sequential organ failure assessment (SOFA) score, simplified 
acute physiology score II (SAPS II) and the comorbidities index Elixhauser 
(SID30) score were calculated according to the parameters. The primary outcome 
was hospital mortality. Differences in baseline characteristics and prognosis 
were examined between patients with normal TSH levels and abnormal TSH levels 
which was determined according to a dichotomous variable provided by the data. 
Multivariable Logistic regression was used to analyze the association between 
TSH levels and prognosis after adjusting for confounding factors. A sensitivity 
analysis was conducted which categorized the study population as three groups 
(i.e., decreased, normal, and elevated TSH levels) using the range of 0.30-3.00 
mU/L as the normal range of TSH.
RESULTS: A total of 3 425 ICU patients were enrolled in the study, of which 2 
692 (78.60%) were with normal TSH and 733 (21.40%) were with abnormal TSH. There 
was no statistically significant difference in gender, age, ethnicity, type of 
admission and the ratio of MV between the normal TSH and abnormal TSH groups. 
Compared with normal TSH group, the patients in abnormal TSH had a higher SOFA, 
SAPS II and SID30 scores as well as the ratio of RRT [SOFA score: 4 (2, 7) vs. 4 
(2, 6), SAPS II score: 38.02±13.76 vs. 36.53±13.75, SID30 score: 11 (4, 22) vs. 
11 (0, 20), RRT ratio: 5.32% (39/733) vs. 3.49% (94/2 692), all P < 0.05]. The 
hospital mortality of patients in normal TSH was significantly higher than that 
of those in abnormal TSH [9.82% (72/733) vs. 5.94% (160/2 692), P < 0.01]. After 
adjusting for confounding factors, abnormal TSH was significantly associated 
with hospital mortality [odds ratio (OR) = 1.71, 95% confidence interval (95%CI) 
was 1.24-2.35, P = 0.001]. In the sensitivity analysis in which the range of 
0.30-3.00 mU/L was used as the normal range of TSH, compared with normal TSH, 
decreased TSH (OR = 2.36, 95%CI was 1.40-3.97, P = 0.001) and elevated TSH (OR = 
1.44, 95%CI was 1.05-1.98, P = 0.023) were both significantly associated with 
increased hospital mortality.
CONCLUSIONS: An abnormal level of TSH within 24 hours after admitted to ICU is 
an independent risk factor for hospital mortality among ICU patients.

The heterogeneity nature of sepsis is significantly impacted by the site of 
infection. This study aims to explore the predictive value of multiple scoring 
systems in assessing the prognosis of septic patients across different infection 
sites. Data for this retrospective cohort study were extracted from the Medical 
Information Mart for Intensive Care IV database (MIMIC-IV) (v2.2). Adult 
patients meeting the criteria for sepsis 3.0 and admitted to the intensive care 
unit (ICU) were enrolled. Infection sites included were pneumonia, urinary tract 
infection (UTI), cellulitis, abdominal infection, and bacteremia. The primary 
outcome assessed was 28-day mortality. The sequential Organ Failure Assessment 
(SOFA) score, Oxford Acute Severity of Illness Score (OASIS), and Logistic Organ 
Dysfunction System (LODS) score were compared. Binomial logistic regression 
analysis was conducted to evaluate the association between these variables and 
mortality. Additionally, differences in the area under the curve (AUC) of 
receiver operating characteristic (ROC) among the scoring systems were analyzed. 
A total of 4721 patients were included in the analysis. The average 28-day 
mortality rate was 9.4%. Significant differences were observed in LODS, OASIS, 
and SOFA scores between the 28-day survival and non-survival groups across 
different infection sites (p < 0.01). In the pneumonia group and abdominal 
infection group, both the LODS and OASIS scoring systems emerged as independent 
risk factors for mortality in septic patients (odds ratio [OR]: 1.165, 95% 
confidence interval [CI]: 1.109-1.224, p < 0.001; OR: 1.047, 95% CI: 
1.028-1.065, p < 0.001) (OR: 1.200, 95% CI: 1.091-1.319, p < 0.001; OR: 1.060, 
95% CI: 1.025-1.095, p < 0.001). For patients with UTI, the LODS, OASIS, and 
SOFA scoring systems were identified as independent risk factors for mortality 
(OR: 1.142, 95% CI: 1.068-1.220, p < 0.001; OR: 1.062, 95% CI: 1.037-1.087, p < 
0.001; OR: 1.146, 95% CI: 1.046-1.255, p = 0.004), with the AUC of LODS score 
and OASIS significantly higher than that of the SOFA score (p = 0.006). Among 
patients with cellulitis, the OASIS and SOFA scoring systems were identified as 
independent risk factors for mortality (OR: 1.055, 95% CI: 1.007-1.106, p = 
0.025; OR: 1.187, 95% CI: 1.005-1.403, p = 0.044), with no significant 
difference in prognosis prediction observed (p = 0.243). In the bacteremia 
group, the LODS scoring system was identified as an independent risk factor for 
mortality (OR: 1.165, 95% CI: 1.109-1.224, p < 0.001). The findings suggest that 
LODS scores offer better prognostic accuracy for predicting the mortality risk 
in septic patients with pneumonia, abdominal infections, bacteremia, and UTI 
compared to SOFA scores.

The relationship between body temperature changes and prognosis in patients with 
acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) remains inconclusive. Our study aimed 
to investigate the clinical value of body temperature in the management of ARDS. 
Data from the Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care III database were 
collected. Adult patients with ARDS were enrolled and further grouped based on 
their temperature values in the intensive care unit. Both the maximum 
(temperaturemax) and minimum (temperaturemin) temperatures were used. The 
primary outcome was 28-day mortality rate. Polynomial regression, subgroup 
analysis, and logistic regression analysis were performed in the final analysis. 
A total of 3922 patients with ARDS were enrolled. There was a U-shaped 
relationship between 28-day mortality and body temperature. For patients with 
infection, the elevated temperaturemax (≥37.0°C) was associated with decreased 
mortality, with an odds ratio ranging from 0.39 to 0.49, using temperaturemax 
from 36.5°C to 36.9°C as reference. For patients without infection, a similar 
tendency was observed, but the protective effect was lost at extremely high 
temperatures (≥38.0°C, p < 0.05). Elevated temperaturemin (≥37.0°C) and 
decreased temperaturemin (<35.0°C) were associated with increased mortality, 
using the temperaturemin from 36.0°C to 36.9°C as a reference. Hypothermia was 
associated with increased mortality in patients with ARDS, while the effect of 
hyperthermia (≥37.0°C) on the mortality of patients with ARDS was not fully 
consistent in the infection and noninfection subgroups. Short-term and transient 
temperatures above 37.0°C would be beneficial to patients with ARDS, but extreme 
hyperthermia and persistent temperatures above 37.0°C should be avoided.

Association between Lactate Dehydrogenase to Albumin Ratio and 28-Day Mortality 
in Patients with Sepsis: a Retrospective Cohort Study.

Liu Z, Liu F, Jie Y, Chen X.

BACKGROUND: This study aims to evaluate the lactate dehydrogenase to albumin 
ratio and mortality at 28 days in patients with sepsis.
METHODS: Data from the Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care IV (MIMIC-IV) 
database were used for this retrospective cohort analysis. The level of the 
lactate dehydrogenase to albumin ratio was recovered at admission and the 
outcome index was mortality at 28 days. Multivariate Cox regression, survival 
curve analysis, and subgroup analysis were used to study the relationship 
between lactate dehydrogenase to albumin ratio and 28-day mortality in sepsis 
patients.
RESULTS: This study included a total of 4,265 patients with sepsis, with a 
28-day mortality rate of 51.9%. After conducting multivariable COX regression 
analysis and adjusting for all potential confounding factors, we observed that 
compared to the LDH/ALB (Q1) group, the Q2 group had a 1.34-fold higher risk of 
28-day mortality (HR = 1.34, 95% CI: 1.20 - 1.49, p < 0.001), while the Q3 group 
had a 1.90-fold higher risk (HR = 1.90, 95% CI: 1.69 - 2.14, p < 0.001). 
Furthermore, the survival analysis curve indicated a gradual increase in the 
28-day mortality rate of septic patients as LDH/ALB levels increased. In 
addition, the ROC curve demonstrated that the area under the curve for LDH/ALB 
was 0.6507 (95% CI: 63.4991% - 66.6368%), which was higher than that of LDH (AUC 
= 0.6434), ALB (AUC = 0.55), and SOFA SCORE (AUC = 0.5564). Finally, subgroup 
analysis revealed no significant interaction between LDH/ALB and the various 
subgroups.
CONCLUSIONS: The LDH/ALB ratio is significantly correlated with mortality at 28 
days in patients with sepsis, which is of significant clinical importance and 
deserves further study.

Medical College, Shantou, Guangdong, China.

BACKGROUND: Excessive BMI was associated with lower mortality after stroke. 
However, some believed that excessive BMI can lead to a poor prognosis because 
of some physiological mechanism, such as glucose metabolism disorder. Therefore, 
this study aims to discuss the association between mortality, BMI, and blood 
glucose.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: This was a retrospective observational study and all data 
were extracted from the Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care III 
database. The exposure was BMI classified into the normal weight group and the 
excessive weight group. The outcome concluded 30-day, 90-day, and 1-year 
mortality. The association between two groups and mortality was elucidated by 
Cox regression models, propensity score matching (PSM) and inverse probability 
of treatment weighting (IPTW). The underlying effect of blood glucose on the 
"obesity paradox" was analyzed by causal mediation analysis.
RESULTS: According to Cox regression models, a significant beneficial effect of 
excessive BMI in terms of mortality was observed: 30-day mortality (HR 0.57, 95% 
CI 0.35-0.90, P = 0.017), 90-day mortality (HR 0.53, 95% CI 0.36-0.78, P = 
0.001), and 1-year mortality (HR 0.65, 95% CI 0.46-0.91, P = 0.013). After PSM 
and IPTW, we got a similar conclusion. The causal mediation analysis showed that 
the protective effect of excessive BMI on 30-day mortality reduced with the 
increase of blood glucose.
CONCLUSION: For ischemic stroke patients in the Intensive Care Unit, those with 
excessive BMI are associated with both lower short-term mortality and lower 
long-term mortality, while the protective effect on 30-day mortality weakened 
accompanied by the increase of blood glucose.

Although previous studies have suggested that albumin-corrected anion gap (ACAG) 
may be a predictor of mortality in critically ill patients in intensive care 
unit (ICU), its utility in the context of asthma has not been definitively 
established. In this study, baseline data, albumin concentration, anion gap (AG) 
and 30-d mortality data were retrieved from the Medical Information Mart for 
Intensive Care IV database (MIMIC-IV) for patients with asthma in the intensive 
care unit. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves were constructed to 
analyze the predictive ability of ACAG and AG. The risk of 30-day mortality 
among patients with ACAG and asthma was analyzed using a restricted cubic spline 
(RCS) plot. Decision curve analysis (DCA) was used to evaluate the clinical 
usefulness of ACAG as a prognostic factor for 30-day mortality. Subsequently, 
subgroup analysis was conducted to explore potential variations in the 
relationship between ACAG and 30-day mortality based on factors such as sex, 
age, whether the asthma was acute, and other co-morbidities. Our study reveals 
that ACAG is a significant independent predictor of 30-day mortality in 
asthmatic patients receiving intensive care. The area under the AUC curve for 
ACAG was found to be 0.703, which is higher than that of AG, indicating that 
ACAG has a better predictive ability for 30-day mortality in this population. 
Furthermore, higher levels of ACAG were found to be associated with increased 
risk of 30-day mortality in asthmatic patients. In addition, decision curve 
analysis (DCA) demonstrated that the net benefit of ACAG was greater than that 
of AG. These findings suggest that ACAG may be a valuable prognostic factor for 
predicting 30-day mortality in asthmatic patients in the ICU. Our study provides 
evidence that ACAG is associated with an increased risk of 30-d mortality and 
has better predictive value in patients with combined asthma who are admitted to 
the ICU than AG.

BACKGROUND: The Endothelial Activation and Stress Index (EASIX) is a recognized 
marker of vascular endothelial health but has limited application in patients 
with atrial fibrillation (AF). This study aimed to explore the association 
between EASIX and prognosis in critically ill patients with AF.
METHODS: The patient's data were extracted from Medical Information Mart for 
Intensive Care IV(MIMIC-IV) database. EASIX was calculated as lactate 
dehydrogenase (U/L) × creatinine (mg/dL)/platelets (109 cells/L) and 
log2-transformed for statistical analysis. The Boruta algorithm and Least 
Absolute Shrinkage and Selection Operator (Lasso) Regression were used for 
feature selection. Multivariable logistic regression and Cox proportional hazard 
models were employed to assess EASIX as a risk factor, with nonlinear 
relationships evaluated using restricted cubic spline curves. The area under the 
receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) was utilized to compare the 
predictive performance of EASIX with the Sequential Organ Failure Assessment 
(SOFA) score and the CHA₂DS₂-VASc score. Furthermore, Kaplan-Meier survival 
analysis based on EASIX quartiles (with Q1 as the reference) and stratified 
analyses were conducted to further explore these associations.
RESULTS: A total of 4896 patients with complete data were included. In-hospital, 
28-day, and 365-day all-cause mortality rates were26.04%, 29.25%, and 49.75%, 
respectively. The median EASIX was 5.64 (4.56, 6.84). Higher EASIX was 
significantly associated with increased in-hospital, short-term, and long-term 
all-cause mortality after multivariable adjustment. Patients in quartiles Q2, 
Q3, and Q4 had significantly higher mortality than those in Q1, showing a clear 
trend. Kaplan-Meier analysis confirmed that patients with higher EASIX scores 
had significantly lower survival. The AUC showed that the performance of EASIX 
in predicting both short-term and long-term all-cause mortality was comparable 
to the SOFA and higher than the CHA₂DS₂-VASc score. Stratified analyses 
indicated that the association remained robust across subgroups, accounting for 
various underlying conditions and hospital interventions.
CONCLUSIONS: EASIX is a reliable predictor of both short- and long-term 
mortality in critically ill patients with AF. Future prospective studies are 
necessary to confirm its broader applicability in other populations.

BACKGROUND: Acute kidney injury (AKI) remains a common complication of coronary 
revascularization and increases poor outcomes in critically ill surgical 
patients. Compared to the plasma volume status (PVS), estimated plasma volume 
status (ePVS) has the advantages of being noninvasive and simple and has been 
shown to be associated with worse prognosis in patients undergoing coronary 
revascularization. This study was to evaluate the association of ePVS with the 
risk of AKI in patients who underwent coronary revascularization.
METHODS: In this retrospective cohort study, data of patients who underwent 
coronary revascularization were extracted from the Medical Information Mart for 
Intensive Care (MIMIC)-IV database (2008-2019). The outcome was the occurrence 
of AKI after ICU admission. The covariates were screened via the LASSO 
regression method. Univariate and multivariate Logistic regression models were 
performed to assess the association of ePVS and PVS and the odds of AKI in 
patients who underwent coronary revascularization, with results shown as odds 
ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs). Subgroup analyses of age, 
surgery, and anticoagulation agents and sequential organ failure assessment 
(SOFA) score were performed to further explore the association of ePVS with AKI.
RESULTS: A total of 3,961 patients who underwent coronary revascularization were 
included in this study, of whom 2,863 (72.28%) had AKI. The high ePVS was 
associated with the higher odds of AKI in patients who received coronary 
revascularization (OR = 1.06, 95%CI: 1.02-1.10), after adjusting for the 
covariates such as age, race, SAPS-II score, SOFA score, CCI, weight, heart 
rate, WBC, RDW-CV, PT, BUN, glucose, calcium, PH, PaO2, mechanical ventilation, 
vasopressors, and diuretic. Similar results were found in patients who underwent 
the CABG (OR = 1.07, 95%CI: 1.02-1.11), without anticoagulation agents use (OR = 
1.07, 95%CI: 1.03-1.12) and with high SOFA score (OR = 1.10, 95%CI: 1.04-1.17). 
No relationship was found between PVS and the odds of AKI in patients who 
underwent the coronary revascularization.
CONCLUSION: The ePVS may be a promising parameter to evaluate the risk of AKI in 
patients undergoing coronary revascularization, which provides a certain 
reference for the risk stratification management of ICU patients who underwent 
coronary revascularization.

BACKGROUND: Previous studies have shown a significant correlation between the 
stress-hyperglycemia ratio (SHR) and mortality. However, it is unknown whether 
the SHR has the same predictive value in severely ill patients. The main purpose 
of this research was to investigate the association between the SHR and 
all-cause mortality in critically ill patients with T2DM.
METHODS: The data used in this study were derived from the Medical Information 
Mart for Intensive Care (MIMIC-IV) database. The primary outcome was 180-day 
mortality and the secondary outcomes were 28-day, 90-day and 365-day mortality. 
The main analytical methods included: Kaplan-Meier survival analysis, the COX 
proportional hazards model and restricted cubic splines.
RESULTS: A total of 993 patients were included. The 28-day, 90-day, 180-day, and 
365-day mortalities reached 10.4%, 14.4%, 16.7% and 19.0%, respectively. 
Multivariate Cox proportional hazards analysis revealed that the elevated SHR 
was significantly related to 28-day, 90-day and 180-day all-cause mortality even 
after cofounder adjustment. Restricted cubic spline analysis revealed a 
nonlinear association between the SHR and the risk of 28-day (p for 
nonlinear=0.014), 90-day (p for nonlinear=0.007), 180-day (p for 
nonlinear=0.001) and 365-day (p for nonlinear=0.003) all-cause mortality.
CONCLUSION: SHR is significantly associated with 28-day, 90-day and 180-day 
all-cause mortality in critically ill patients with T2DM. This may help us 
identify patients at higher risk of death early.

PURPOSE: Previous studies have revealed that elevated mean central venous 
pressure (CVP) was associated with poor prognosis in specific patient groups. 
But no study explored the impact of mean CVP on prognosis of patients who 
underwent coronary artery bypass grafting surgery (CABG). The purpose of this 
study was to investigate the impacts of elevated CVP and its time-course on 
clinical outcomes of patients who underwent CABG and potential mechanisms.
METHODS: A retrospective cohort study was performed based on the Medical 
Information Mart for Intensive Care IV (MIMIC-IV) database. We first identified 
the CVP during specific period with the most predictive value. Patients were 
categorized into the low-CVP and high-CVP group on the basis of the cut-off 
value. A propensity score matching was used to adjust covariates. The primary 
outcome was a 28-day mortality. The secondary outcomes were 1-year mortality and 
in-hospital mortality, the length of intensive care unit (ICU) stay and 
hospitalization, acute kidney injury incidence, use of vasopressors, duration of 
ventilation and oxygen index, and lactate levels and clearance. Patients in the 
high-CVP group were categorized into the "second day CVP ≤ 13.46 mmHg" group and 
the "second day CVP > 13.46 mmHg" group, respectively, and the clinical outcomes 
were the same as before.
RESULTS: A total of 6,255 patients who underwent CABG were picked from the 
MIMIC-IV database, of which 5,641 CABG patients were monitored by CVP 
measurement during the first 2 days after ICU admission and 206,016 CVP records 
were extracted from the database. The mean CVP during the first 24 h was the 
most correlative and statistically significant for the 28-day mortality. The 
risk of the 28-day mortality was increased in the high-CVP group [OR 3.45 (95% 
CI: 1.77-6.70; p < 0.001)]. Patients with elevated CVP levels had worse 
secondary outcomes. The maximum of lactate levels and lactate clearance were 
also poor in the high-CVP group. For patients in the high-CVP group during the 
first 24 h, whose mean CVP during the second day lowered to less than the 
cut-off value, had better clinical outcomes.
CONCLUSIONS: An elevated mean CVP during the first 24 h was correlated with poor 
outcomes in patients who underwent CABG. The potential mechanisms may be 
influencing the lactate levels and lactate clearance through the impact on 
afterload of tissue perfusion. Patients whose mean CVP during the second day 
dropped to less than the cut-off value had favorable prognosis.

The objective of this study was to investigate whether serum anion gap (AG), 
which may serve as an indicator for multiple organic dysfunctions in the 
condition of hypoxia, could be utilized as a reliable prognostic marker for 
short-term mortality and a potential therapeutic target in patients with acute 
respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). A retrospective cohort study was conducted 
using data from the Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care (MIMIC-IV) 
electronic database (version 2.2), including 11,227 confirmed patients with 
ARDS. Multivariate Cox proportional hazards analysis revealed a significant 
association between elevated AG levels and all-cause mortality. After adjusting 
for confounding factors, elevated AG levels were strongly correlated with 90-day 
mortality [adjusted hazard ratio (HR) 1.23; 95% confidence interval (CI) 
1.10-1.37; P < 0.001]. Restricted cubic splines and Kaplan-Meier curves 
demonstrated an increased risk of all-cause mortality with higher AG levels. 
Subgroup analysis results emphasized the significance of furosemide as a pivotal 
therapeutic option, which was further supported by subsequent Kaplan-Meier 
curves and Cox proportional hazards analysis showing its protective effects in 
patients with elevated serum AG levels. Even after adjusting for relevant 
confounding factors, furosemide continued to exhibit a significant protective 
effect in the group with the highest AG level (Q4: adjusted HR 0.57; 95% CI 
0.50-0.65; P < 0.001); however, no significant protective effect was observed in 
the intermediate level groups (Q2 and Q3). In summary, this research 
demonstrated a significant association between heightened serum AG levels and 
increased mortality risk among ARDS patients, which was mitigated by 
administration of furosemide.

BACKGROUND: Patients with atrial fibrillation (AF) suffer a higher risk of 
death, and it is necessary to develop prediction tools for mortality risk in 
critically ill patients with AF. This study aimed to develop a novel predictive 
nomogram of in-hospital mortality after 48 h in the coronary care unit (CCU) for 
patients with AF.
METHODS: We collected information on CCU patients with AF from the "Medical 
Information Mart for Intensive Care-III" database and developed a nomogram model 
for predicting the all-cause mortality risk after 48 h in the hospital. Key 
variables were selected by univariate logistic and least absolute shrinkage and 
selection operator regression. The independent predictors with p < 0.05 were 
screened out by multivariate logistic regression. A predictive nomogram was 
constructed using these independent predictors, and the model calibration and 
discrimination were evaluated.
RESULTS: This study finally enrolled 1248 CCU patients with AF, and the 
in-hospital mortality was 17% (209/1248). The predictive nomogram was 
constructed by 13 selected independent predictors, including age, smoking 
status, acute kidney injury, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, ventricular 
arrhythmia, shock, urea, red cell distribution width, leucocytosis, continuous 
renal replacement therapy, continuous positive airway pressure, anticoagulation, 
and heart rate. The area under the curve of the nomogram was 0.803 (95% 
confidence interval 0.771-0.835). The nomogram was verified to have good 
accuracy and calibration.
CONCLUSIONS: This study developed a novel nomogram containing age, acute kidney 
injury, and heart rate that can be a good predictor of potential in-hospital 
mortality after 48 h in CCU patients with AF.

BACKGROUND: Stress Hyperglycemia Ratio (SHR) reflects the acute blood glucose 
variation in critically ill conditions. However, its prognostic value in chronic 
kidney disease (CKD) remains understudied. This study aimed to investigate the 
association between SHR and one-year mortality in CKD patients hospitalized in 
the Intensive Care Unit (ICU).
METHODS: Patients with diagnosis of CKD in the Medical Information Mart for 
Intensive Care IV (MIMIC-IV) database were enrolled. Incidence of all-cause 
mortality within one-year follow-up was used as the primary endpoint.
RESULTS: 1825 CKD patients were included in the study. A "U-shaped" relationship 
between SHR and one-year mortality as identified using multivariate restricted 
cubic spline (RCS) analysis. Then study population were categorized into three 
groups: Group 1 (SHR < 0.70), Group 2 (0.70 ≤ SHR ≤ 0.95) and Group 3 
(SHR > 0.95). Group 2 showed significantly better one-year outcomes compared to 
the other two groups (p = 0.0031). This survival benefit persisted across 
subgroup analyses stratified by age, sex, CKD stage, anemia and various clinical 
conditions.
CONCLUSION: SHR proved to be a meaningful biomarker for predicting one-year 
mortality in ICU-admitted CKD patients, with a "U-shaped" correlation. The 
identification of the optimal SHR range (0.70-0.95) provided clinicians with a 
valuable tool for detecting high-risk populations.

Systemic inflammation plays a crucial role in the pathogenesis and prognosis of 
diabetes and cardiovascular diseases. System inflammation response index (SIRI), 
is an emerging biomarker designed to assess the extent of systemic inflammation. 
We aimed to delineate the prognostic significance of SIRI in patients with both 
AF and type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). Utilizing the Medical Information Mart 
for Intensive Care IV (MIMIC-IV) (v2.2) repository, subjects divided into three 
groups based on the SIRI index. The primary endpoint of our study was all-cause 
mortality during hospitalization, with one-year mortality serving as the 
secondary endpoint. A cohort of 2054 AF and T2DM patients participated. COX 
regression analysis revealed elevated SIRI levels as an independent risk factor 
for both in-hospital and 1-year mortality. 192 patients died during 
hospitalization, and 265 died during the follow-up of 1 year. When treating the 
SIRI as a continuous variable, a higher SIRI was significantly associated with 
increased all-cause mortality both in-hospital [hazard ratio (HR) 1.015, 95%CI 
1.010-1.020, P = 0.015] and 1-year (HR 1. 016, 95%CI 1.008-1.015, P = 0.012). 
Additionally, compared to patients with the lowest tertiles of SIRI, those with 
the highest tertiles of SIRI possessed significantly higher all-cause mortality 
both in-hospital and 1-year after multivariable adjustment, and this 
relationship remained pronounced in AF and T2DM patients [in-hospital mortality 
(HR: 1.863, 95% CI 1.189-2.918, P = 0.007); one-year mortality (HR: 2.143, 95% 
CI 1.621-2.831, P < 0.001)]. Our RCS analyses indicated a pronounced linear 
association between SIRI and mortality in T2DM (p-value for non-linear < 0.001). 
In AF patients with T2DM, high SIRI is an independent predictor of poor survival 
and may be helpful for patient's risk stratification.

AIM: To investigate the relationship between the ionized-to-total calcium ratio 
and the incidence of acute kidney injury (AKI) in critically ill patients with 
autoimmune diseases.
METHODS: A retrospective study was conducted utilizing data from the Medical 
Information Mart for Intensive Care IV database. In-hospital AKI was the primary 
outcome. Patients were classified into four distinct categories depending on the 
calcium ratio. Cox proportional hazards model and restricted cubic spline (RCS) 
analysis were applied to assess the association between the calcium ratio and 
AKI risk. Subgroup analyses were conducted to evaluate the consistency of this 
association across various patient characteristics.
RESULTS: A total of 1054 critically ill patients with autoimmune diseases were 
enrolled and stratified by calcium ratio quartiles into four groups (< 0.515; 
0.515-0.546; 0.546-0.576; > 0.576). Cumulative incidence curves showed 
significant difference in AKI risk among the four groups. Patients in the 
highest calcium ratio quartile experienced a markedly reduced likelihood of AKI 
versus those in the lowest, especially in the fully adjusted model (HR = 0.66, 
95% CI 0.51-0.84, p < 0.001). RCS analysis demonstrated an obvious nonlinear 
relationship, showing a steep decline in AKI risk with increasing calcium ratio, 
which eventually plateaued. This protective effect of higher calcium ratios 
against AKI was consistent across subgroups, except in those with chronic kidney 
disease at baseline.
CONCLUSION: The ionized-to-total calcium ratio proves to be significantly 
associated with the development of AKI in critically ill patients with 
autoimmune diseases, with its elevation indicating a reduced AKI risk.

BACKGROUND: Cardiogenic shock (CS) is a critical illness with a high mortality 
rate in clinical practice. Although some biomarkers have been found to be 
associated with mortality in patients suffering from CS in previous studies. The 
albumin-corrected anion gap (ACAG) has not been studied in depth. Our study 
aimed to explore the relationship between ACAG and mortality in patients with 
CS.
METHODS: All baseline data was extracted from Medical Information Mart for 
Intensive Care-IV version: 2.0 (MIMIC-IV). According to the prognosis at 30 days 
of follow-up, they were divided into survivors and non-survivors groups. The 
survival curves between the two groups were drawn using the Kaplan-Meier method 
and the log-rank test. Valid factors were selected using the least absolute 
shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) logistic analysis model. Analysis was 
performed to investigate the relationship between mortality and all enrolled 
patients using restricted cubic spline (RCS) and Cox proportional hazards 
models. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves were used to assess the 
predictive ability of ACAG. Evaluation of final result stability using 
sensitivity analysis.
RESULTS: 839 cases were selected to meet the inclusion criteria and categorized 
into survivors and non-survivors groups in the final analysis. The ACAG value 
measured for the first time at the time of admission was selected as the 
research object. Kaplan-Meier (K-M) survival curves showed that cumulative 30- 
and 90-day survival decreased progressively with elevated ACAG (p  <  0.001), 
and multifactorial Cox regression analyses showed ACAG to be an independent risk 
factor for increased 30- and 90-day mortality in patients suffering from CS (p 
 <  0.05). RCS curves revealed that all-cause mortality in this group of 
patients increased with increasing ACAG ( χ 2 = 5.830, p = 0.120). The ROC curve 
showed that the best cutoff value for ACAG for predicting 30-day mortality in 
patients with CS was 22.625, with a sensitivity of 44.0% and a specificity of 
74.7%. The relationship between ACAG and CS short-term mortality remained stable 
in all sensitivity analyses (All p  <  0.05).
CONCLUSIONS: The ACAG is an independent risk factor for 30- and 90-day mortality 
in CS patients and predicts poor clinical outcomes in CS patients. According to 
our study, elevated ACAG at admission, especially when ACAG  >  20 mmol/L, was 
an independent predictor of all-cause mortality in CS.

BACKGROUND: Heart rate (HR) was one of the risk factors for cardiovascular 
disease, but there was insufficient evidence to demonstrate a relationship 
between heart rate fluctuations and the prognosis of patients with acute 
myocardial infarction (AMI). The objective of this study is to investigate the 
relationship between 24-h heart rate fluctuations after admission to the 
Intensive Care Unit (ICU) and 30-day, 1-year, and 3-year mortality rates in 
patients with AMI in order to examine its implications for prognosis in AMI 
patients.
METHODS: All data were obtained from the Medical Information Mart for Intensive 
Care III Database (MIMIC III). We calculated heart rate fluctuations using the 
maximum and minimum values of the patient's heart rate during the first 24 h 
after ICU admission and divided them into three groups (< 23beats/min, 
23-33beats/min, > 33beats/min) according to tertiles. The COX risk regression 
model was applied to the analysis, and subgroup analyses were performed for use 
in testing the robustness of the results. Curve fitting was performed to explore 
whether there was a nonlinear relationship between heart rate fluctuations and 
mortality. Outcome measures were 30-day, 1-year, and 3-year mortality in 
patients with AMI.
RESULTS: After strict confounding adjustment, COX multifactorial analysis showed 
that patients' heart rate fluctuations were positively associated with 30-day, 
1-year, and 3-year mortality rates (HR = 1.17, 95%CI: 1.11 ~ 1.23; HR = 1.17, 
95%CI: 1.12 ~ 1.22; HR = 1.17, 95%CI: 1.12 ~ 1.21). In addition, the high heart 
rate fluctuation group (> 33 beats/min) had a significantly increased risk of 
death (HR = 1.76, 95%CI: 1.28 ~ 2.42; HR = 1.59, 95%CI: 1.25 ~ 2.03; HR = 1.43, 
95%CI: 1.15 ~ 1.77). In the curve-fitting analysis, a J-shaped curve 
relationship among heart rate fluctuations and 1- and 3-year mortality was found 
(p for non-linearity = 0.049; p for non-linearity = 0.004), with an inflection 
point of 28 beats/min. In subgroup analyses, there was an interaction between 
heart rate fluctuations and age (P for interaction = 0.041).
CONCLUSIONS: Heart rate fluctuations within 24 h after ICU admission of AMI 
patients were associated with 30-day, 1-year, and 3-year mortality, which is a 
simple and stable predictor of patients' short- and long-term prognosis. 
Furthermore, 24-h heart rate fluctuations showed a "J" curve relationship with 
1- and 3-year mortality, with fluctuations of 28 beats/min predicting the best 
prognosis.

INTRODUCTION: Inflammation is closely related to adverse outcomes of acute 
myocardial infarction (AMI). This study aimed to evaluate whether 
neutrophil-lymphocyte ratio (NLR) can predict poor prognosis of critical AMI 
patients.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: We designed a retrospective cohort study and extracted 
AMI patients from the "Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care-III" 
database. The primary outcome was 1-year all-cause mortality. The secondary 
outcomes were 90-day and in-hospital all-cause mortalities, and acute kidney 
injury (AKI) incidence. The optimal cut-offs of NLR were picked by X-tile 
software according to the 1-year mortality and patient groups were created: 
low-NLR (< 4.8), high-NLR (4.8 - 21.1), and very high-NLR (> 21.1). Cox and 
modified Poisson regression models were used to evaluate the effect of NLR on 
outcomes in critically AMI patients.
RESULTS: Finally, 782 critical AMI patients were enrolled in this study, and the 
1-year mortality was 32% (249/782). The high- and very high-NLR groups had a 
higher incidence of outcomes than the low-NLR group (P < 0.05). The multivariate 
regression analyses found that the high- and very high-NLR groups had a higher 
risk of 1-year mortality (Hazard ratio (HR) = 1.59, 95% CI: 1.12 to 2.24, P = 
0.009 and HR = 1.73, 95% CI: 1.09 to 2.73, P = 0.020), 90-day mortality (HR = 
1.69, 95% CI: 1.13 to 2.54, P = 0.011 and HR = 1.90, 95% CI: 1.13 to 3.20, P = 
0.016), in-hospital mortality (Relative risk (RR) = 1.77, 95% CI: 1.14 to 2.74, 
P = 0.010 and RR = 2.10, 95% CI: 1.23 to 3.58, P = 0.007), and AKI incidence (RR 
= 1.44, 95% CI: 1.06 to 1.95, P = 0.018 and RR = 1.34, 95% CI: 0.87 to 2.07, P = 
0.180) compared with low-NLR group. NLR retained stable predictive ability in 
sensitivity analyses.
CONCLUSION: Baseline NLR is an independent risk factor for 1-year mortality, 
90-day mortality, in-hospital mortality, and AKI incidence in AMI patients.

INTRODUCTION: So far, no study has investigated the association between 
subclinical hepatic fibrosis and sepsis, especially in terms of prognosis.
OBJECTIVES: The purpose of our study was to explore the association of liver 
fibrosis indexes with the outcomes of septic patients without overt chronic 
liver disease.
PATIENTS AND METHODS: We performed a cohort study using data extracted from the 
Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care III (version 1.4) database. External 
validation was obtained from the First Affiliated Hospital of Wenzhou Medical 
University, China. We calculated the Aspartate Aminotransferase-to-Platelet 
Ratio Index, the Fibrosis‑4 (FIB‑4) score, and the Nonalcoholic Fatty Liver 
Disease Fibrosis Score using the existing formulas. The primary outcome was 
28‑day mortality. We assessed the associations of these 3 indexes with patient 
outcomes using logistic regression analysis.
RESULTS: In the FIB‑4 sepsis cohort (n = 1560), there was a significant stepwise 
increase from quartile 1 to quartile 4 in the risk of 28‑day mortality (quartile 
1: reference; quartile 2: odds ratio [OR], 1.57, P = 0.06, 95% CI, 0.98-2.515; 
quartile 3: OR, 2.363, P <0.001, 95% CI, 1.512-3.692; quartile 4: OR, 2.933, P 
<0.001, 95% CI, 1.895-4.538). The results of multivariable regression, 
Kaplan-Meier, and Cox regression analyses as well as external validation 
exhibited good consistency.
CONCLUSIONS: The FIB‑4 index is associated with 28‑day, 90‑day, and in‑hospital 
mortality as well as with renal replacement therapy in septic patients without 
overt chronic liver disease. In other words, an advanced stage of subclinical 
hepatic fibrosis as represented by the FIB‑4 score indicates poor outcomes in 
patients with sepsis.

BACKGROUND: Estimated pulse wave velocity (ePWV), which measures vascular aging, 
is an independent predictor of cardiovascular death. Nevertheless, the 
relationship between ePWV and all-cause mortality among patients suffering from 
non-traumatic subarachnoid hemorrhages (NSAH) remains obscure. Consequently, the 
objective of this study is to ascertain whether ePWV exerts influence on the 
prognosis of individuals afflicted with NSAH.
METHODS: Through the Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care IV (MIMIC-IV) 
database, 644 eligible participants were included. The Kaplan-Meier survival 
curve method was employed to assess the disparity in survival status between the 
low and high ePWV cohorts. The Cox proportional hazard model was employed to 
investigate the association between ePWV and inpatient mortality among 
critically ill patients diagnosed with NSAH. The Restricted Cubic Spline (RCS) 
model was employed to examine the dose-response correlation. Subsequently, 
multivariate Cox regression analysis was performed to identify independent 
prognostic factors. Lastly, the impact of ePWV on inpatient mortality across 
various subgroups was evaluated through stratified analysis.
RESULTS: Participants were categorized into two groups, delineated by their ePWV 
levels: a low ePWV level group and a high ePWV level group. Survival analysis 
unveiled that individuals with high ePWV exhibited a diminished survival rate 
compared to their counterparts with low ePWV. Following adjustment, low ePWV was 
significantly linked with a reduced risk of inpatient mortality among patients 
with NSAH (HR = 0.54, 95% CI = 0.32-0.89, p = 0.016). Simultaneously, analysis 
employing the RCS model further substantiated a linear escalation in the risk of 
inpatient mortality with increasing ePWV values.
CONCLUSION: Elevated ePWV levels have been identified as an independent risk 
factor for the rise in inpatient mortality among NSAH patients and as a 
significant predictor of the clinical outcome of NSAH.

Background: Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) is a common infection 
complication in intensive care units (ICU). It not only prolongs mechanical 
ventilation and ICU and hospital stays, but also increases medical costs and 
increases the mortality risk of patients. Although many studies have found that 
thiamine supplementation in critically ill patients may improve prognoses, there 
is still no research or evidence that thiamine supplementation is beneficial for 
patients with VAP. The purpose of this study was to determine the association 
between thiamine and the prognoses of patients with VAP. Methods: This study 
retrospectively collected all patients with VAP in the ICU from the Medical 
Information Mart for Intensive Care-IV database. The outcomes were ICU and 
in-hospital mortality. Patients were divided into the no-thiamine and thiamine 
groups depending upon whether or not they had received supplementation. 
Associations between thiamine and the outcomes were tested using Kaplan-Meier 
(KM) survival curves and Cox proportional-hazards regression models. The 
statistical methods of propensity-score matching (PSM) and inverse probability 
weighting (IPW) based on the XGBoost model were also applied to ensure the 
robustness of our findings. Results: The study finally included 1,654 patients 
with VAP, comprising 1,151 and 503 in the no-thiamine and thiamine groups, 
respectively. The KM survival curves indicated that the survival probability 
differed significantly between the two groups. After multivariate COX regression 
adjusted for confounding factors, the hazard ratio (95% confidence interval) 
values for ICU and in-hospital mortality in the thiamine group were 0.57 (0.37, 
0.88) and 0.64 (0.45, 0.92), respectively. Moreover, the results of the PSM and 
IPW analyses were consistent with the original population. Conclusion: Thiamine 
supplementation may reduce ICU and in-hospital mortality in patients with VAP in 
the ICU. Thiamine is an inexpensive and safe drug, and so further clinical 
trials should be conducted to provide more-solid evidence on whether it improves 
the prognosis of patients with VAP.

OBJECTIVE: To explore the relationship between Anion Gap (AG), Albumin Corrected 
AG (ACAG), and in-hospital mortality of Acute Myocardial Infarction (AMI) 
patients and develop a prediction model for predicting the mortality in AMI 
patients.
METHODS: This was a retrospective cohort study based on the Medical Information 
Mart for Intensive Care (MIMIC)-Ⅲ, MIMIC-IV, and eICU Collaborative Study 
Database (eICU). A total of 9767 AMI patients who were admitted to the intensive 
care unit were included. The authors employed univariate and multivariable cox 
proportional hazards analyses to investigate the association between AG, ACAG, 
and in-hospital mortality; p < 0.05 was considered statistically significant. A 
nomogram incorporating ACAG and clinical indicators was developed and validated 
for predicting mortality among AMI patients.
RESULTS: Both ACAG and AG exhibited a significant association with an elevated 
risk of in-hospital mortality in AMI patients. The C-index of ACAG (C-index = 
0.606) was significantly higher than AG (C-index = 0.589). A nomogram (ACAG 
combined model) was developed to predict the in-hospital mortality for AMI 
patients. The nomogram demonstrated a good predictive performance by Area Under 
the Curve (AUC) of 0.763 in the training set, 0.744 and 0.681 in the external 
validation cohort. The C-index of the nomogram was 0.759 in the training set, 
0.756 and 0.762 in the validation cohorts. Additionally, the C-index of the 
nomogram was obviously higher than the ACAG and age shock index in three 
databases.
CONCLUSION: ACAG was related to in-hospital mortality among AMI patients. The 
authors developed a nomogram incorporating ACAG and clinical indicators, 
demonstrating good performance for predicting in-hospital mortality of AMI 
patients.

BACKGROUND: The interplay between atrial fibrillation (AF) and obesity on 
mortality in critically ill patients warrants detailed exploration, given their 
individual impacts on patient prognosis. This study aimed to assess the 
associations between AF, obesity, and 1-year mortality in a critically ill 
population.
METHODS: Utilizing data from the Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care 
(MIMIC)-IV database, we conducted a retrospective analysis of adult patients 
admitted to the intensive care unit. The primary endpoint was 1-year mortality, 
analyzed through Cox regression with hazard ratio (HR) and Kaplan-Meier survival 
methods.
RESULTS: The study included 25,654 patients (median age 67.0 years, 40.6% 
female), with 39.0% having AF and 36.1% being obese. Multivariate COX regression 
analysis revealed that AF was associated with a 14.7% increase in the risk of 
1-year mortality (p < 0.001), while obesity was linked to a 13.9% reduction in 
mortality risk (p < 0.001). The protective effect of obesity on mortality was 
similar in patients with (HR = 0.85) and without AF (HR = 0.86). AF led to a 
slightly higher risk of mortality in patients without obesity (HR = 1.16) 
compared to those with obesity (HR = 1.13). Kaplan-Meier survival curves 
highlighted that non-obese patients with AF had the lowest survival rate, 
whereas the highest survival was observed in obese patients without AF.
CONCLUSIONS: AF significantly increased 1-year mortality risk in critically ill 
patients, whereas obesity was associated with a decreased mortality risk. The 
most adverse survival outcomes were identified in non-obese patients with AF.

Septic patients in the intensive care unit (ICU) often develop sepsis-associated 
delirium (SAD), which is strongly associated with poor prognosis. The aim of 
this study is to develop a machine learning-based model for the early prediction 
of SAD. Patient data were extracted from the Medical Information Mart for 
Intensive Care IV (MIMIC-IV) database and the eICU Collaborative Research 
Database (eICU-CRD). The MIMIC-IV data were divided into a training set and an 
internal validation set, while the eICU-CRD data served as an external 
validation set. Feature variables were selected using least absolute shrinkage 
and selection operator regression, and prediction models were built using 
logistic regression, support vector machines, decision trees, random forests, 
extreme gradient boosting (XGBoost), k-nearest neighbors and naive Bayes 
methods. The performance of the models was evaluated in the validation set. The 
model was also applied to a group of patients who were not assessed or could not 
be assessed for delirium. The MIMIC-IV and eICU-CRD databases included 14,620 
and 1723 patients, respectively, with a median time to diagnosis of SAD of 24 
and 30 h. Compared with Non-SAD patients, SAD patients had higher 28-days ICU 
mortality rates and longer ICU stays. Among the models compared, the XGBoost 
model had the best performance and was selected as the final model (internal 
validation area under the receiver operating characteristic curves 
(AUROC) = 0.793, external validation AUROC = 0.701). The XGBoost model 
outperformed other models in predicting SAD. The establishment of this 
predictive model allows for earlier prediction of SAD compared to traditional 
delirium assessments and is applicable to patients who are difficult to assess 
with traditional methods.

BACKGROUND: Acute kidney injury (AKI) is a common complication in heart failure 
(HF) patients. Patients with heart failure who experience renal injury tend to 
have a poor prognosis. The objective of this study is to examine the correlation 
between the occurrence of AKI in heart failure patients and different mean 
arterial pressure (MAP) trajectories, with the goal of improving early 
identification and intervention for AKI.
METHODS: A retrospective study was conducted on patients with heart failure 
using data from the Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care IV (MIMIC-IV). 
We utilized the group-based trajectory modeling (GBTM) method to classify the 
24-hour MAP change trajectories in heart failure patients. The occurrence of AKI 
within the first 7 days of intensive care unit (ICU) admission was considered 
the outcome. The impact of MAP trajectories on AKI occurrence in heart failure 
patients was analyzed using Cox proportional hazards models, competing risk 
models, and doubly robust estimation methods.
RESULTS: A cohort of 8,502 HF patients was analyzed, with their 24-hour MAP 
trajectories categorized into five groups: Low MAP group (Class 1), Medium MAP 
group (Class 2), Low-medium MAP group (Class 3), High-to-low MAP group (Class 
4), and High MAP group (Class 5). The results from the doubly robust analysis 
revealed that Class 4 exhibited a significantly increased AKI risk than Class 3 
(HR 1.284, 95% CI 1.085-1.521, p = 0.003; HR 1.271, 95% CI 1.074-1.505, 
p = 0.005). Conversely, the risks of Class 2 were significantly lower than those 
of Class 3 (HR 0.846, 95% CI 0.745-0.960, p = 0.009; HR 0.879, 95% CI 
0.774-0.998, p = 0.047).
CONCLUSIONS: The 24-hour MAP trajectory in HF patients influences the risk of 
AKI. A rapid decrease in MAP (Class 4) is associated with a higher AKI risk, 
while maintaining MAP at a moderate level (Class 2) significantly reduces this 
risk. Therefore, closely monitoring MAP changes is crucial for preventing AKI in 
HF.

INTRODUCTION: Cardiac arrest (CA), characterized by its heterogeneity, poses 
challenges in patient management. This study aimed to identify clinical 
subphenotypes in CA patients to aid in patient classification, prognosis 
assessment, and treatment decision-making.
METHODS: For this study, comprehensive data were extracted from the Medical 
Information Mart for Intensive Care IV (MIMIC-IV) 2.0 database. We excluded 
patients under 18 years old, those not initially admitted to the intensive care 
unit (ICU), or treated in the ICU for less than 72 h. A total of 57 clinical 
parameters relevant to CA patients were selected for analysis. These included 
demographic data, vital signs, and laboratory parameters. After an extensive 
literature review and expert consultations, key factors such as temperature (T), 
sodium (Na), creatinine (CR), glucose (GLU), heart rate (HR), PaO2/FiO2 ratio 
(P/F), hemoglobin (HB), mean arterial pressure (MAP), platelets (PLT), and white 
blood cell count (WBC) were identified as the most significant for cluster 
analysis. Consensus cluster analysis was utilized to examine the mean values of 
these routine clinical parameters within the first 24 h post-ICU admission to 
categorize patient classes. Furthermore, in-hospital and 28-day mortality rates 
of patients across different CA subphenotypes were assessed using multivariate 
logistic and Cox regression analysis.
RESULTS: After applying exclusion criteria, 719 CA patients were included in the 
study, with a median age of 67.22 years (IQR: 55.50-79.34), of whom 63.28% were 
male. The analysis delineated two distinct subphenotypes: Subphenotype 1 (SP1) 
and Subphenotype 2 (SP2). Compared to SP1, patients in SP2 exhibited 
significantly higher levels of P/F, HB, MAP, PLT, and Na, but lower levels of T, 
HR, GLU, WBC, and CR. SP2 patients had a notably higher in-hospital mortality 
rate compared to SP1 (53.01% for SP2 vs. 39.36% for SP1, P < 0.001). 28-day 
mortality decreased continuously for both subphenotypes, with a more rapid 
decline in SP2. These differences remained significant after adjusting for 
potential covariates (adjusted OR = 1.82, 95% CI: 1.26-2.64, P = 0.002; 
HR = 1.84, 95% CI: 1.40-2.41, P < 0.001).
CONCLUSIONS: The study successfully identified two distinct clinical 
subphenotypes of CA by analyzing routine clinical data from the first 24 h 
following ICU admission. SP1 was characterized by a lower rate of in-hospital 
and 28-day mortality when compared to SP2. This differentiation could play a 
crucial role in tailoring patient care, assessing prognosis, and guiding more 
targeted treatment strategies for CA patients.

Jiangbei District), Chongqing, China.

OBJECTIVES: The objective of this study was to investigate the association 
between the prognostic nutritional index (PNI) and the short-term outcomes in 
patients with community-acquired bacterial pneumonia (CABP).
DESIGN: This study employed a retrospective design, utilizing data from the 
Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care (MIMIC)-IV database.
PARTICIPANTS: 371 individuals from the MIMIC-IV database who were diagnosed with 
CABP.
PRIMARY AND SECONDARY OUTCOMES: The primary endpoint was 28-day all-cause 
mortality. The secondary endpoint was the length of stay (LOS) in the intensive 
care unit (ICU) and in hospital.
RESULTS: The area under the curve of PNI for predicting 28-day all-cause 
mortality is 0.702 (95% CI 0.630 to 0.775; p < 0.001). Patients were divided 
into two groups based on their PNI at admission: the low PNI (<35.75) group and 
the high PNI group (≥35.75). CABP patients with higher PNI presented a lower 
28-day all-cause mortality rate (adjusted HR: 0.53, 95% CI 0.28-0.98, 
p = 0.044). Moreover, a negative linear correlation was found between the PNI 
and short-term mortality rates via restricted cubic splines. Eventually, there 
was no difference in the LOS in the ICU or hospital between the two groups.
CONCLUSION: These findings suggest a negative correlation between the PNI at 
admission and the short-term mortality rate of CABP. PNI is helpful for early 
identification of high-risk patients.

OBJECTIVE: In addition to its antiplatelet and anti-inflammatory properties, 
aspirin inhibits bacterial proliferation directly. The potential benefits of 
aspirin may enhance the prognosis for sepsis patients. However, little is known 
about the effects of early aspirin administration. This study aimed to examine 
the correlation between the administration of aspirin at an early stage and the 
90-day mortality rate among sepsis patients.
METHODS: In order to distinguish between septic patients who received early 
aspirin treatment and those who did not, queries were conducted on the Medical 
Information Mart for Intensive Care IV (MIMIC-IV) database. The principal metric 
utilized was 90-day mortality. We determined the association between early 
aspirin use and 90-day mortality using multivariate Cox regression, and 
propensity score matching (PSM) was utilized to validate our findings. The 
analyses of the subgroups have been completed.
RESULTS: Our analysis comprised 28,425 septic patients, of whom 7,568 (26.6%) 
received aspirin within 24 h of intensive care unit (ICU) admission. The aspirin 
users group had a lower 90-day mortality than the aspirin nonusers group [1,624 
(21.8%) vs. 2,035 (27.3%), P < 0.001]. The logistic regression showed that early 
aspirin use was associated with a lower 90-day mortality (OR, 0.74, 95% CI, 
0.69-0.80, P < 0.001). K-M curve analysis showed that the 90-day mortality of 
the aspirin users group was significantly lower than that of the aspirin 
nonusers group (P < 0.001). Subgroup analysis revealed comparable relationships 
between early aspirin use and 90-day mortality among individuals.
CONCLUSION: In conclusion, early aspirin use was associated with decreased 
in-hospital and 90-day mortality in septic patients, emphasizing the 
significance of early aspirin use administration in the ICU.

BACKGROUND Neutrophil-lymphocyte ratio (NLR) is related to increased mortality 
risk in many diseases. However, there is limited research on critically ill 
patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). A retrospective 
cohort study was performed to investigate whether NLR can be used as a biomarker 
to predict the mortality of critically ill COPD patients. MATERIAL AND METHODS 
In the research, the data were gathered from the database of the Medical 
Information Mart for Intensive Care-IV. The 28-day mortality was defined as the 
primary outcome, while the secondary outcomes were in-hospital and 90-day 
mortality. Through the application of the Kaplan-Meier curves and the 
multivariate Cox regression analysis, the potential association between NLR and 
mortality for critically ill patients with COPD was evaluated. For subgroup 
analysis, age, sex, ethnicity, mean blood pressure, and comorbidities were 
considered. RESULTS We extracted data on 2650 patients, of which 53.7% were 
male. A higher level of NLR was correlated with higher 28-day mortality risk. 
Compared to the lower quartile (NLR<4.56), HR (95% CI) of the upper quartile 
(NLR>16.86) was 1.75 (1.21-2.52) in the multivariate Cox regression model when 
adjusted for confounders (P=0.003). A similar tendency was found in the 90-day 
mortality (HR=1.59, 95% CI=1.16-2.19, P=0.004) and the in-hospital mortality 
(HR=1.71, 95% CI=1.22-2.42, P=0.002). Subgroup analyses showed that the 
correlation between NLR and 28-day mortality was stable. CONCLUSIONS The higher 
level of NLR is likely to be correlated with the increase of the all-cause 
mortality risk in critically ill patients with COPD, but this needs to be 
validated in future prospective research.

Background: Traumatic brain injury-induced coagulopathy (TBI-IC), is a disease 
with poor prognosis and increased mortality rate. Objectives: Our study aimed to 
identify predictors as well as develop machine learning (ML) models to predict 
the risk of coagulopathy in this population. Methods: ML models were developed 
and validated based on two public databases named Medical Information Mart for 
Intensive Care (MIMIC)-IV and the eICU Collaborative Research Database 
(eICU-CRD). Candidate predictors, including demographics, family history, 
comorbidities, vital signs, laboratory findings, injury type, therapy strategy 
and scoring system were included. Models were compared on area under the curve 
(AUC), accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, positive and negative predictive 
values, and decision curve analysis (DCA) curve. Results: Of 999 patients in 
MIMIC-IV included in the final cohort, a total of 493 (49.35%) patients 
developed coagulopathy following TBI. Recursive feature elimination (RFE) 
selected 15 variables, including international normalized ratio (INR), 
prothrombin time (PT), sepsis related organ failure assessment (SOFA), activated 
partial thromboplastin time (APTT), platelet (PLT), hematocrit (HCT), red blood 
cell (RBC), hemoglobin (HGB), blood urea nitrogen (BUN), red blood cell volume 
distribution width (RDW), creatinine (CRE), congestive heart failure, myocardial 
infarction, sodium, and blood transfusion. The external validation in eICU-CRD 
demonstrated that adapting boosting (Ada) model had the highest AUC of 0.924 
(95% CI: 0.902-0.943). Furthermore, in the DCA curve, the Ada model and the 
extreme Gradient Boosting (XGB) model had relatively higher net benefits (ie, 
the correct classification of coagulopathy considering a trade-off between 
false- negatives and false-positives)-over other models across a range of 
threshold probability values. Conclusions: The ML models, as indicated by our 
study, can be used to predict the incidence of TBI-IC in the intensive care unit 
(ICU).

BACKGROUND: Severe acute pancreatitis (SAP) can cause various complications. 
Septic shock is a relatively common and serious complication that causes 
uncontrolled systemic inflammatory response syndrome, which is one of the main 
causes of death. This study aimed to develop a nomogram for predicting the 
overall survival of SAP patients during the initial 24 hours following 
admission.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: All the data utilized in this study were obtained from 
the MIMIC-III (Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care III) database. The 
data were analyzed using multivariate Cox regression, and the performance of the 
proposed nomogram was evaluated based on Harrell's concordance index (C-index) 
and the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC). The 
clinical value of the prediction model was tested using decision-curve analysis 
(DCA). The primary outcomes were 28-day, 60-day, and 90-day mortality rates.
RESULTS: The 850 patients included in the analysis comprised 595 in the training 
cohort and 255 in the validation cohort. The training cohort consisted of 353 
(59.3%) males and 242 (40.7%) females with SAP. Multivariate Cox regression 
showed that weight, sex, insurance status, explicit sepsis, SAPSII score, 
Elixhauser score, bilirubin, anion gap, creatinine, hematocrit, hemoglobin, RDW, 
SPO2, and respiratory rate were independent prognostic factors for the survival 
of SAP patients admitted to an intensive care unit. The predicted values were 
compared using C-indexes, calibration plots, integrated discrimination 
improvement, net reclassification improvement, and DCA.
CONCLUSIONS: We have identified some important demographic and laboratory 
parameters related to the prognosis of patients with SAP and have used them to 
establish a more accurate and convenient nomogram for evaluating their 28-day, 
60-day, and 90-day mortality rates.

BACKGROUND: There are few widely accepted and operationally feasible models for 
predicting the mortality risk of patients in surgical intensive care unit 
(SICU). Although serum anion gap (AG) is known to be correlated with severe 
metabolic acidosis, no investigations have been reported about the association 
between AG level and the outcome during hospitalization in SICU. This study 
aimed to explore the predictive power of AG for 90-day all-cause mortality in 
SICU.
METHODS: Data of the eligible patients in SICU from 2008 to 2019 was obtained 
from the Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care IV version 2.0 (MIMIC-IV 
v2.0) database. Baseline clinical data of the selected patients was compared in 
different groups stratified by the outcome during their admission via univariate 
analysis. Restricted cubic spline (RCS) was drawn to confirm the relationship of 
AG and the short-term mortality. Kaplan-Meier survival curve was plotted in 
different AG level groups. Univariate and multivariate Cox analyses were 
performed, and Cox proportional-hazards models were built to investigate an 
independent role of AG to predict 90-day all-cause mortality risk in SICU. 
Receiver operating characteristics (ROC) curves analysis was performed to 
evaluate the predictive value of AG on the 90-day prognosis of patients.
RESULTS: A total of 6,395 patients were enrolled in this study and the 90-day 
all-cause mortality rate was 18.17%. Univariate analysis showed that elevated 
serum AG was associated with higher mortality (P < 0.001). RCS analysis 
indicated a positively linear relationship between serum AG and the risk of 
90-day all-cause mortality in SICU (χ2 = 4.730, P = 0.193). Kaplan-Meier 
survival analysis demonstrated that low-AG group (with a cutoff value of 14.10 
mmol/L) had a significantly higher cumulative survival rate than the counterpart 
of high-AG group (χ2 = 96.370, P < 0.001). Cox proportional-hazards models were 
constructed and confirmed the independent predictive role of AG in 90-day 
all-cause mortality risk in SICU after adjusting for 23 confounding factors 
gradually (HR 1.423, 1.246-1.625, P < 0.001). In the further subgroup analyses, 
a significant interaction was confirmed between AG and sepsis as well as surgery 
on the risk for the 90-day mortality. The ROC curve showed that the optimal 
cut-off value of AG for predicting 90-day mortality was 14.89 with sensitivity 
of 60.7% and specificity of 54.8%. The area under curve (AUC) was 0.602. When 
combined with SOFA score, the AUC of AG for predicting 90-day prognosis was 
0.710, with a sensitivity and specificity of 70% and 62.5% respectively.
CONCLUSIONS: Elevated AG (≥ 14.10 mmol/L) is an independent risk factor for 
predicting severe conditions and poor prognosis of critical ill surgical 
patients.

To investigate the relationship between hemoglobin-to-red blood cell 
distribution width (RDW) ratio (HRR) and the 30-day mortality risk in acute 
pancreatitis (AP), and assess the predictive ability of HRR. Data from 2001 to 
2019 in the Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care-III/IV (MIMIC-III/IV) 
were analyzed. The outcome of this retrospective cohort study was 30-day 
mortality. Hemoglobin-to-RDW ratio (0-24 hours) and HRR (24-48 hours) were 
divided into 4 groups based on quartiles (Q1, Q2, Q3, and Q4). The predictive 
effect was evaluated by the C-index. A total of 1736 patients were included, and 
30-day mortality occurred in 204 (11.75%) patients. Compared with Q1 of HRR 
(0-24 hours), Q2 (HR = 0.60, 95% CI : 0.42-0.86), Q3 (HR =0.47, 95% CI : 
0.31-0.71), and Q4 (HR = 0.45, 95% CI : 0.29-0.68) of HRR levels reduced the 
30-day mortality risk. Hemoglobin-to-RDW ratio (24-48 hours) was consistent with 
the results of HRR (0-24 hours). For changes in HRR, Q4 for changes in HRR 
levels (HR = 1.64, 95% CI : 1.09-2.45) increased the 30-day mortality risk. 
Hemoglobin-toRDW ratio significantly improved the predictive effect of 
Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (C-index = 0.736) and Bedside Index of 
Severity in Acute Pancreatitis (C-index = 0.704) on 30-day mortality. Higher HRR 
levels reduced the 30-day mortality risk in AP and may improve the prediction of 
other tools.

BACKGROUND: This study aimed to investigate the relationship between the blood 
urea nitrogen to serum albumin ratio (BAR) and in-hospital mortality in patients 
with sepsis.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: This is a retrospective cohort study. All septic patient 
data for the study were obtained from the intensive care unit of Beth Israel 
Deaconess Medical Center. Adjusted hazard ratios (HRs) and 95% confidence 
intervals (CIs) were calculated using multivariable Cox regression analyses. 
Survival curves were plotted and subgroup analyses were stratified by relevant 
covariates.
RESULTS: Among 23,901 patients, 13,464 with sepsis were included. The overall 
in-hospital mortality rate was 18.9% (2550/13464). After adjustment for 
confounding factors, patients in the highest BAR quartile had an increased risk 
of sepsis death than those in the lowest BAR quartile (HR: 1.42, 95% CI: 
1.3-1.55), using BAR as a categorical variable. When BAR was presented as a 
continuous variable, the prevalence of in-hospital sepsis-related death 
increased by 8% (adjusted HR: 1.08, 95% CI: 1.07-1.1, P < 0.001) for each 5-unit 
increase in BAR, irrespective of confounders. Stratified analyses indicated age 
interactions (P < 0.001), and the correlation between BAR and the probability of 
dying due to sepsis was stable.
CONCLUSION: BAR was significantly associated with in-hospital mortality in 
intensive care patients with sepsis. A higher BAR in patients with sepsis is 
associated with a worse prognosis in the ICU in the USA. However, further 
research is required to confirm this finding.

BACKGROUND: The impact of obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) on the prognosis of 
intensive care unit (ICU) patients remains controversial. Thus, this study aimed 
to determine the association between OSA status and outcomes in ICU patients.
METHODS: We conducted a retrospective cohort study composed of 38,177 critically 
ill patients from the Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care III 
(MIMIC-III) database. Propensity score matching was used to evaluate the 
association between OSA and mortality in ICU adults.
RESULTS: A total of 38,177 critically ill patients were included in this study. 
Among them, 1428 (3.71%) patients had OSA. Before matching, patients with OSA 
had a significantly lower 28-day mortality (relative risk (RR), 0.47; 95% 
confidence interval (CI), 0.38-0.58), 90-day mortality (RR, 0.50; 95% CI, 
0.43-0.60), ICU mortality (RR, 0.41; 95% CI, 0.31-0.54), and in-hospital 
mortality (RR, 0.46; 95% CI, 0.36-0.57). After adjusting with propensity-score 
matching, the findings of reduced risk of mortality remained unchanged. The RR 
of 28-day mortality, 90-day mortality, ICU mortality, in-hospital mortality was 
0.57 (95% CI, 0.34-0.57), 0.53 (95% CI, 0.40-0.70), 0.54 (95% CI, 0.37-0.79), 
and 0.55 (95% CI, 0.39-0.77), respectively.
CONCLUSION: This study indicated that ICU patients with OSA had a significantly 
lower risk of mortality compared with those without OSA.

BACKGROUND: The relationship between baseline hemoglobin levels and in-hospital 
mortality in septic patients remains unclear. This study aimed to clarify this 
association in critically ill patients with sepsis.
METHODS: Patients with sepsis were retrospectively identified from the Medical 
Information Mart for Intensive Care-IV (MIMIC-IV 2.2) and eICU Collaborative 
Research Database (eICU-CRD). Multivariate logistic regression analysis and 
restricted cubic spline regression were used to investigate the association 
between hemoglobin and the risk of in-hospital mortality. Additionally, a 
two-part linear regression model was used to determine threshold effects. 
Stratified analyses were also performed.
RESULTS: A total of 21,946 patients from MIMIC-IV and 15,495 patients from 
eICU-CRD were included in the study. In-hospital mortality was 14.95% in 
MIMIC-IV and 17.40% in eICU-CRD. Multivariate logistic regression showed that 
hemoglobin was significantly and nonlinearly associated with the risk of 
in-hospital mortality after adjusting for other covariates. Furthermore, we 
found a nonlinear association between hemoglobin and in-hospital mortality, with 
mortality plateauing at 10.2 g/dL. The risk of mortality decreased with 
increasing hemoglobin levels below 10.2 g/dL but increased when hemoglobin 
levels exceeded 10.2 g/dL. These findings were validated in the eICU-CRD 
dataset.
CONCLUSIONS: A nonlinear correlation between hemoglobin levels and in-hospital 
mortality was observed in patients with sepsis, with a threshold of 10.2 g/DL. 
These findings suggested that hemoglobin levels below or above the threshold may 
be associated with worse outcomes, warranting further investigation in 
prospective studies.

PURPOSE: To investigate the association between red cell distribution width 
(RDW) to albumin (ALB) ratio and acute kidney injury (AKI) in sepsis.
METHODS: This was a retrospective cohort study. Data were collected from the 
Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care Database IV (MIMIC-IV) from 2008 to 
2019. The incidence of AKI was the primary outcome, which was defined based on 
the improving Global Outcomes (KDIGO). The association of RDW/ALB ratio with AKI 
in sepsis was assessed by multivariate logistic regression analysis using 
relative risk (RR) and a 95% confidence interval (CI). Subgroup group analyses 
were applied according to age, use of ventilation, and use of vasopressor, SAPS 
II, and SOFA.
RESULTS: Of 1810 sepsis patients involved in this study, 563 (31.10%) sepsis 
patients developed AKI after ICU admission. The results suggested an increase in 
RDW/ALB was associated with a rise in the risk of AKI in sepsis (RR 1.09, 95% CI 
1.02 to 1.16, P = 0.013).Based on the subgroup analysis, RDW/ALB ratio was 
significantly associated with the risk of AKI in sepsis patients using the 
treatment of ventilation (RR: 1.07, 95% CI 1.01 to 1.14, P = 0.041)) and in 
patients with SAPS II < 43 (RR: 1.16, 95% CI 1.04 to 1.29, P = 0.007).
CONCLUSION: RDW/ALB ratio was independently associated with the risk of AKI in 
sepsis patients.

Heart failure is a common complication in patients with sepsis, and individuals 
who experience both sepsis and heart failure are at a heightened risk for 
adverse outcomes. This study aims to develop an effective nomogram model to 
predict the 7-day, 15-day, and 30-day survival probabilities of septic patients 
with heart failure in the intensive care unit (ICU). This study extracted the 
pertinent clinical data of septic patients with heart failure from the Critical 
Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care (MIMIC-IV) database. Patients were 
then randomly allocated into a training set and a test set at a ratio of 7:3. 
Cox proportional hazards regression analysis was used to determine independent 
risk factors influencing patient prognosis and to develop a nomogram model. The 
model's efficacy and clinical significance were assessed through metrics such as 
the concordance index (C-index), time-dependent receiver operating 
characteristic (ROC), calibration curve, and decision curve analysis (DCA). A 
total of 5,490 septic patients with heart failure were included in the study. A 
nomogram model was developed to predict short-term survival probabilities, using 
13 variables: age, pneumonia, endotracheal intubation, mechanical ventilation, 
potassium (K), anion gap (AG), lactate (Lac), activated partial thromboplastin 
time (APTT), white blood cell count (WBC), red cell distribution width (RDW), 
hemoglobin-to-red cell distribution width ratio (HRR), Sequential Organ Failure 
Assessment (SOFA) score, and Charlson Comorbidity Index (CCI). The C-index was 
0.730 (95% CI 0.719-0.742) for the training set and 0.761 (95% CI 0.745-0.776) 
for the test set, indicating strong model accuracy, indicating good model 
accuracy. Evaluations via the ROC curve, calibration curve, and decision curve 
analyses further confirmed the model's reliability and utility. This study 
effectively developed a straightforward and efficient nomogram model to predict 
the 7-day, 15-day, and 30-day survival probabilities of septic patients with 
heart failure in the ICU. The implementation of treatment strategies that 
address the risk factors identified in the model can enhance patient outcomes 
and increase survival rates.

OBJECTIVES: Postoperative acute kidney injury (pAKI) is a serious complication 
of Stanford type A aortic dissection (TAAD) surgery, which is significantly 
associated with the inflammatory response. This study aimed to explore the 
relationship between blood count-derived inflammatory markers (BCDIMs) and pAKI 
and to construct a predictive model for pAKI.
METHODS: Patients who underwent TAAD surgery were obtained from our center and 
the Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care (MIMIC)-IV database. The 
differences in preoperative BCDIMs and clinical outcomes of patients with and 
without pAKI were analyzed. Logistic regression was used to construct predictive 
models based on preoperative BCDIMs or white cell counts (WCCs). The performance 
of the BCDIMs and WCCs models was evaluated and compared using the receiver 
operating characteristic (ROC) curve, area under the ROC curve (AUC), 
Hosmer-Lemeshow test, calibration plot, net reclassification index (NRI), 
integrated discrimination improvement index (IDI), and decision curve analysis 
(DCA). The Kaplan-Meier curves were applied to compare the survival rate between 
different groups.
RESULTS: The overall incidence of pAKI in patients who underwent TAAD surgery 
from our center was 48.63% (124/255). The presence of pAKI was associated with 
longer ventilation time, higher incidence of cerebral complications and 
postoperative hepatic dysfunction, and higher in-hospital mortality. The results 
of the logistic regression indicated that the monocyte-lymphocyte ratio (MLR) 
was an independent risk factor for pAKI. The BCDIMs model had good 
discriminating ability, predictive ability, and clinical utility. In addition, 
the performance of the BCDIMs model was significantly better than that of the 
WCCs model. Analysis of data from the MIMIC-IV database validated that MLR was 
an independent risk factor for pAKI and had predictive value for pAKI. Finally, 
data from the MIMIC-IV database demonstrated that patients with a high MLR had a 
significantly poor 28-day survival rate when compared to patients with a low 
MLR.
CONCLUSION: Our study suggested that the MLR is an independent risk factor for 
pAKI. A predictive model based on BCDIMs had good discriminating ability, 
predictive ability, and clinical utility. Moreover, the performance of the 
BCDIMs model was significantly better than that of the WCCs model. Finally, a 
high MLR was significantly associated with poor short-term survival of patients 
who underwent TAAD surgery.

Background: Cardiac surgery-associated acute kidney injury (CSA-AKI) is a common 
and serious complication after cardiac surgery. The influence of statin use 
before surgery on the renal outcome of patients undergoing cardiac surgery is 
controversial. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the effect of statins 
on postoperative renal outcomes in patients undergoing cardiac surgery. Methods: 
We included CSA-AKI patients in the Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care 
(MIMIC)-IV database and were divided into statin group and non-statin group 
according to whether they used statins before entering intensive care units 
(ICU). The main outcomes were hospitalization and 30-day mortality, and the 
secondary outcomes were 60-day mortality and 90-day mortality. We used 
propensity score matching (PSM) to adjust for confounding factors. The 95% 
confidence interval (CI) and risk ratio (RO) were calculated by the COX 
proportional regression model. At the same time, stratified analysis was used to 
explore whether the relationship between the statins use before intensive care 
units and mortality was different in each subgroup and whether the relationship 
between different doses of Atorvastatin and mortality was different. Result: We 
identified 675 pre-ICU statin users and 2095 non-statin users. In the COX 
proportional regression model, pre-ICU statin use was associated with decreased 
in-hospital (HR = 0.407, 95%confidence interval 0.278-0.595, p < 0.001) and 
30-day mortality (HR = 0.407, 95%CI 0.279-0.595, p < 0.001). The survival rate 
of patients who took statins before entering ICU was significantly higher than 
that of those who did not use statins at 30 days, 60 days and 90 days. There is 
a significant interaction between patients with aged>65 years (HR = 0.373, 95%CI 
0.240-0.581, p < 0.001), Acute kidney injury grade I (HR = 0.244, 95%CI 
0.118-0.428, p < 0.001), and without post-myocardial infarction syndrome (HR = 
0.344, 95%CI 0.218-0.542, p < 0.001). The mortality in hospital and 60 days of 
CSA-AKI patients treated with ≥80 mg Atorvastatin before operation was 
significantly reduced (p < 0.05). Conclusion: The pre-ICU statin use was 
significantly associated with decreased risk in hospital and 30-day mortality. 
The preoperative use of ≥80 mg Atorvastatin may improve the prognosis of 
CSA-AKI.

BACKGROUND: A large amount of evidence has shown the necessity of lowering blood 
pressure (BP) in patients with acute cerebral hemorrhage, but whether reducing 
BP contributes to lower short-term and long-term mortality in these patients 
remains uncertain.
AIMS: We aimed to explore the association between BP, including systolic and 
diastolic BP, during intensive care unit (ICU) admission and 1-month and 1-year 
mortality after discharge of patients with cerebral hemorrhage.
METHODS: A total of 1085 patients with cerebral hemorrhage were obtained from 
the Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care III (MIMIC-III) database. 
Maximum and minimum values of systolic and diastolic BP in these patients during 
their ICU stay were recorded, and endpoint events were defined as the 1-month 
mortality and 1-year mortality after the first admission. Multivariable adjusted 
models were performed for the association of BP with the endpoint events.
RESULTS: We observed that patients with hypertension were likely to be older, 
Asian or Black and had worse health insurance and higher systolic BP than those 
without hypertension. The logistic regression analysis showed inverse 
relationships between systolic BP-min (odds ratio (OR) = 0.986, 95% CI 
0.983-0.989, P < 0.001) and diastolic BP-min (OR = 0.975, 95% CI 0.968-0.981, 
P < 0.001) and risks of 1-month, as well as 1-year mortality when controlling 
for confounders including age, sex, race, insurance, heart failure, myocardial 
infarct, malignancy, cerebral infarction, diabetes and chronic kidney disease. 
Furthermore, smooth curve analysis suggested an approximate L-shaped association 
of systolic BP with the risk of 1-month mortality and 1-year mortality. Reducing 
systolic BP in the range of 100-150 mmHg has a lower death risk in these 
patients with cerebral hemorrhage.
CONCLUSION: We observed an L-shaped association between systolic BP levels and 
the risks of 1-month and 1-year mortality in patients with cerebral hemorrhage, 
which supported that lowering BP when treating an acute hypertensive response 
could reduce short-term and long-term mortality.

INTRODUCTION: Pharmacological support has become the mainstay therapy in 
patients with cardiogenic shock (CS). Unfortunately, the clinical benefits of 
such potent drugs remain unclear, therefore, the present study aims to elucidate 
the safety and efficacy of vasoactive agents in CS patients.
METHODS: Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care (MIMIC) IV databases were 
used for this retrospective study. The primary outcome of this study was 30-day 
all-cause mortality. The subgroup analysis of was the relationship between the 
combined use of vasopressors and inotropes and 30-day all-cause mortality.
RESULTS: A total of 2,216 patients diagnosed with CS were enrolled in this 
study. The non-survivors group was more likely to be older, presented with 
chronic kidney disease, have a lower systolic blood pressure, lower heart rate, 
and higher respiratory rate (all p < 0.05). In the multivariate Cox regression 
analysis, only dopamine [HR (95%CI): 1.219 (1.003-1.482)], norepinephrine [HR 
(95%CI): 2.528 (1.829-3.493)], and milrinone [HR (95%CI): 0.664 (0.512-0.861)] 
remained an independent predictor for 30-day all-cause mortality. Furthermore, a 
subgroup analysis was performed and found that no statistically significant 
difference between no vasopressor/inotrope use and 1 vasopressor/inotrope use 
(p = 0.107). Meanwhile, a substantial deterioration of cumulative survival was 
observed when a combination of 2 or more vasopressors/inotropes was used in CS 
patients in comparison with no vasopressor/inotrope or only 1 
vasopressor/inotrope use (all p < 0.05).
CONCLUSIONS: Using vasopressors/inotropes agents was associated with a higher 
risk of 30-day all-cause mortality in CS patients. In addition, only milrinone 
was associated with a better prognosis among the available vasoactive agents.

BACKGROUND: Hemoglobin-to-red cell distribution width ratio (HRR) has shown good 
prognostic value in various cancers. However, the relationship between HRR and 
outcomes in critically ill patients with traumatic brain injury (TBI) remains 
unclear. This study aimed to investigate the association between HRR and 
mortality among critically ill patients with TBI.
METHODS: The Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care-IV (MIMIC-IV) database 
was utilized to conduct this retrospective cohort study. TBI patients were 
divided into four quartiles according to their HRR values. The primary outcome 
was 30-day mortality, whereas the secondary outcomes were 60-day and 120-day 
mortality. Univariable and multivariable Cox proportional risk models were 
performed to evaluate the hazard ratio (HR) and 95% confidence interval (CI) for 
the relationship between HRR and mortality. Receiver operating characteristic 
(ROC) curves were conducted to assess the prognostic value of HRR.
RESULTS: For 30-day mortality, after adjustment for all potential covariates, 
the relationship remained significant with HRR treated as a continuous variable 
(HR, 95% CI: 0.87 [0.81, 0.92]; p < 0.001). In the fully adjusted model, the HR 
with 95% CI for the second, third, and fourth quartile groups were 0.67 (0.5, 
0.9), 0.65 (0.46, 0.94), and 0.5 (0.32, 0.79), respectively, compared to the 
first quartile group. A similar relationship was also observed for 60-day 
mortality and 120-day mortality. HRR had a better predictive value than 
hemoglobin and red cell distribution width (RDW).
CONCLUSIONS: A lower level of HRR is significantly associated with higher 
all-cause mortality among critically ill patients with TBI.

OBJECTIVE: To explore the association between dynamic changes in red blood cell 
distribution width to platelet count ratio (RPR) during hospitalisation and 
short-term mortality in patients with sepsis.
DESIGN: A retrospective cohort study using propensity score matching.
SETTING: Intensive care units (ICUs) of Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center.
PARTICIPANTS: A total of 8731 adult patients with sepsis were included in the 
study. The patients were identified from the ICU of the Medical Information Mart 
for Intensive Care database. The observed group included patients who 
experienced an increase in RPR of more than 30% during the first week of ICU 
admission, whereas the control group included the rest.
MAIN OUTCOME AND MEASURE: Using propensity score matching, a matched control 
group was created. The primary outcome was 28-day mortality, and the length of 
hospital stay and in-hospital mortality were the secondary outcomes.
RESULTS: The difference was evident in 28-day mortality between the two groups 
(85.8% vs 74.5%, p<0.001, Kaplan-Meier analysis, and HR=1.896, 95% CI=1.659 to 
2.168, p<0.001, Cox regression). In the secondary outcomes, there was a 
significant difference in in-hospital mortality (p<0.001). In addition, the 
study discovered that the observed groups had a significantly longer hospital 
stay (p<0.001). Meanwhile, the results of subgroup analyses were consistent with 
those of the primary analyses.
CONCLUSIONS: In patients with sepsis, a significantly increased RPR is 
positively associated with the short-term death rate. Continuous RPR monitoring 
could be a valuable measure for predicting short-term mortality in patients with 
sepsis.

BACKGROUND: In recent years, the hemoglobin, albumin, lymphocyte, and platelet 
(HALP) score has emerged as a potential marker of immunological and nutritional 
status. This study aimed to evaluate the association between the HALP score and 
prognosis in patients with sepsis.
METHODS: This retrospective cohort study analyzed sepsis patients using clinical 
data from the Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care IV (MIMIC-IV) 
database. Patients were classified into Low-score and High-score groups. 
Confounding factors were controlled through propensity score matching (PSM) 
analysis. The primary outcome was 28-day mortality in individuals with sepsis. 
Survival probabilities between groups were compared using Kaplan-Meier curves. 
Multivariable Cox regression analysis and a smoothing spline fitting curve were 
employed to investigate the relationship between the HALP score and 28-day 
mortality. ROC curve analysis and subgroup analysis were performed to evaluate 
the predictive ability of the HALP score and its components.
RESULTS: A total of 2,968 sepsis patients were included, with 809 (27.26%) 
deaths within 28 days. After PSM analysis, the High-score group had a 24% lower 
risk of 28-day mortality compared to the Low-score group (HR, 0.76; 95% CI, 
0.64-0.91). In the unmatched cohort, the multivariable Cox regression model also 
indicated that the High-score group had a lower 28-day mortality risk (HR, 0.78; 
95% CI, 0.67-0.91). The smoothing spline fitting curve showed a nonlinear 
relationship between the HALP score and 28-day mortality, with an inflection 
point at 24.69. When the HALP score was below 24.69, an increase of one point in 
the HALP score was associated with a 2% reduction in 28-day mortality (HR, 0.98; 
95% CI, 0.97-0.99). The HALP score provided incremental predictive value for 
28-day mortality when combined with the SOFA score. Albumin was identified as 
the most influential component of the HALP score.
CONCLUSION: Among patients with sepsis, the HALP score exhibited a nonlinear 
relationship with 28-day mortality. An elevated HALP score is associated with 
reduced 28-day, 90-day, 360-day, and in-hospital mortality among sepsis 
patients.

STUDY OBJECTIVE: The lactate-to-albumin ratio (LAR) has been confirmed to be an 
effective prognostic marker in sepsis, heart failure, and acute respiratory 
failure. However, the relationship between LAR and mortality in patients with 
acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) remains unclear. We aim to evaluate 
the predictive value of LAR for ARDS patients.
DESIGN: A retrospective cohort study.
SETTING: Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care IV (v2.2) database.
PATIENTS: 769 patients with acute respiratory distress syndrome(ARDS).
INTERVENTIONS: We divided the patients into two subgroups according to the 
primary study endpoint (28-days all-cause mortality): the 28-day survivors and 
the 28-day non-survivors.
MEASURES: Multivariate Cox Regression, Receiver Operator Characteristic (ROC) 
and Kaplan-Meier survival analysis were used to investigate the relationship 
between LAR and short-time mortality in patients with ARDS.
MAIN RESULTS: The 28-day mortality was 38 % in this study. Multivariable Cox 
regression analysis showed that LAR was an independent predictive factor for 
28-day mortality (HR 1.11, 95 %CI: 1.06-1.16, P < 0.001). The area under curve 
(AUC) of LAR in the ROC was 70.34 % (95 %CI: 66.53 % - 74.15 %) that provided 
significantly higher discrimination compared with lactate (AUC = 68.00 %, 
P = 0.0007) or albumin (AUC = 63.17 %, P = 0.002) alone. LAR was also not 
inferior to SAPSII with the AUC of 73.44 % (95 %CI: 69.84 % - 77.04 %, 
P = 0.21). Additionally, Kaplan-Meier survival analysis displayed that ARDS 
patients with high LAR (> the cut-off value 0.9055) had a significantly higher 
28-day overall mortality rate (P < 0.001) and in-hospital mortality rate 
(P < 0.001). However, patients in high LAR group had shorter length of hospital 
stay (P < 0.001), which might be caused by higher in-hospital mortality.
CONCLUSIONS: We confirmed that there was a positive correlation between LAR and 
28-day mortality. This could provide anesthesiologists and critical care 
physicians with a more convenient tool than SAPSII without being superior for 
detecting ARDS patients with poor prognosis timely.

BACKGROUND: Anion gap (AG) has been proved to be associated with prognosis of 
many cardiovascular diseases. This study is aimed at exploring the association 
of AG with inhospital all-cause mortality and adverse clinical outcomes in 
coronary care unit (CCU) patients.
METHOD: All data of this study was extracted from Medical Information Mart for 
Intensive Care III (MIMIC-III, version 1.4) database. All patients were divided 
into four groups according to AG quartiles. Primary outcome was inhospital 
all-cause mortality. Lowess smoothing curve was drawn to describe the overall 
trend of inhospital mortality. Binary logistic regression analysis was performed 
to determine the independent effect of AG on inhospital mortality.
RESULT: A total of 3593 patients were enrolled in this study. In unadjusted 
model, as AG quartiles increased, inhospital mortality increased significantly, 
OR increased stepwise from quartile 2 (OR, 95% CI: 1.01, 0.74-1.38, P = 0.958) 
to quartile 4 (OR, 95% CI: 2.72, 2.08-3.55, P < 0.001). After adjusting for 
possible confounding variables, this association was attenuated, but still 
remained statistically significant (quartile 1 vs. quartile 4: OR, 95% CI: 1.02, 
0.72-1.45 vs. 1.49, 1.07-2.09, P = 0.019). Moreover, CCU mortality (P < 0.001) 
and rate of acute kidney injury (P < 0.001) were proved to be higher in the 
highest AG quartiles. Length of CCU (P < 0.001) and hospital stay (P < 0.001) 
prolonged significantly in higher AG quartiles. Maximum sequential organ failure 
assessment score (SOFA) (P < 0.001) and simplified acute physiology score II 
(SAPSII) (P < 0.001) increased significantly as AG quartiles increased. Moderate 
predictive ability of AG on inhospital (AUC: 0.6291), CCU mortality (AUC: 
0.6355), and acute kidney injury (AUC: 0.6096) was confirmed. The interactions 
were proved to be significant in hypercholesterolemia, congestive heart failure, 
chronic lung disease, respiratory failure, oral anticoagulants, Beta-blocks, 
angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor (ACEI)/angiotensin receptor blocker 
(ARB), and vasopressin treatment subgroups.
CONCLUSION: AG was an independent risk factor of inhospital all-cause mortality 
and was associated with adverse clinical outcomes in CCU patients.

Background: Sepsis-induced coagulopathy (SIC) is a common cause for inducing 
poor prognosis of critically ill patients in intensive care unit (ICU). However, 
currently there are no tools specifically designed for assessing short-term 
mortality in SIC patients. This study aimed to develop a practical nomogram to 
predict the risk of 28-day mortality in SIC patients. Methods: In this 
retrospective cohort study, we extracted patients from the Medical Information 
Mart for Intensive Care III (MIMIC-III) database. Sepsis was defined based on 
Sepsis 3.0 criteria and SIC based on Toshiaki Iba's criteria. Kaplan-Meier 
curves were plotted to compare the short survival time between SIC and non-SIC 
patients. Afterward, only SIC cohort was randomly divided into training or 
validation set. We employed univariate logistic regression and stepwise 
multivariate analysis to select predictive features. The proposed nomogram was 
developed based on multivariate logistic regression model, and the 
discrimination and calibration were verified by internal validation. We then 
compared model discrimination with other traditional severity scores and machine 
learning models. Results: 9432 sepsis patients in MIMIC III were enrolled, in 
which 3280 (34.8%) patients were diagnosed as SIC during the first ICU 
admission. SIC was independently associated with the 7- and 28-day mortality of 
ICU patients. K-M curve indicated a significant difference in 7-day (Log-Rank: P 
< 0.001 and P = 0.017) and 28-day survival (Log-Rank: P < 0.001 and P < 0.001) 
between SIC and non-SIC groups whether the propensity score match (PSM) was 
balanced or not. For nomogram development, a total of thirteen variables of 
3,280 SIC patients were enrolled. When predicted the risk of 28-day mortality, 
the nomogram performed a good discrimination in training and validation sets 
(AUROC: 0.78 and 0.81). The AUROC values were 0.80, 0.81, 0.71, 0.70, 0.74, and 
0.60 for random forest, support vector machine, sequential organ failure 
assessment (SOFA) score, logistic organ dysfunction score (LODS), simplified 
acute physiology II score (SAPS II) and SIC score, respectively, in validation 
set. And the nomogram calibration slope was 0.91, the Brier value was 0.15. As 
presented by the decision curve analyses, the nomogram always obtained more net 
benefit when compared with other severity scores. Conclusions: SIC is 
independently related to the short-term mortality of ICU patients. The nomogram 
achieved an optimal prediction of 28-day mortality in SIC patient, which can 
lead to a better prognostics assessment. However, the discriminative ability of 
the nomogram requires validation in external cohorts to further improve 
generalizability.

BACKGROUND: Acute exacerbation of Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (AECOPD) 
contributes significantly to mortality among patients with COPD in Intensive 
care unit (ICU). This study aimed to develop a nomogram to predict 30-day 
mortality among AECOPD patients in ICU.
METHODS: In this retrospective cohort study, we extracted AECOPD patients from 
Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care III (MIMIC-III) database. 
Multivariate logistic regression based on Akaike information criterion (AIC) was 
used to establish the nomogram. Internal validation was performed by a bootstrap 
resampling approach with 1000 replications. The discrimination and calibration 
of the nomogram were evaluated by Harrell's concordance index (C-index) and 
Hosmer-Lemeshow (HL) goodness-of-fit test. Decision curve analysis (DCA) was 
performed to evaluate its clinical application.
RESULTS: A total of 494 patients were finally included in the study with a mean 
age of 70.8 years old. 417 (84.4%) patients were in the survivor group and 77 
(15.6%) patients were in the non-survivor group. Multivariate logistic 
regression analysis based on AIC included age, pO2, neutrophil-to-lymphocyte 
ratio (NLR), prognostic nutritional index (PNI), invasive mechanical ventilation 
and vasopressor use to construct the nomogram. The adjusted C-index was 0.745 
(0.712, 0.778) with good calibration (HL test, P = 0.147). The Kaplan-Meier 
survival curves revealed a significantly lower survival probability in the 
high-risk group than that in the low-risk group (P < 0.001). DCA showed that 
nomogram was clinically useful.
CONCLUSION: The nomogram developed in this study could help clinicians to 
stratify AECOPD patients and provide appropriate care in clinical setting.

OBJECTIVE: Heart failure (HF) complicated by acute kidney injury (AKI) 
significantly impacts patient outcomes, and it is crucial to make early 
predictions of short-term mortality. This study is focused on developing an 
interpretable machine learning model to enhance early prediction accuracy in 
such clinical scenarios.
METHODS: This retrospective cohort study utilized data from the Medical 
Information Mart for Intensive Care Ⅳ (MIMIC-Ⅳ, version 2.0) database. Data from 
the first 24 hours after admission to the ICU were extracted and divided into a 
training set (70%) and a validation set (30%). We utilized the SHapley Additive 
exPlanation (SHAP) method to interpret the workings of an extreme gradient 
boosting (XGBoost) model and identify key prognostic factors. The XGBoost 
model's predictive ability was evaluated against three other machine learning 
models using the area under the curve (AUC) metric, and its interpretation was 
enhanced using the SHAP method.
RESULTS: The study included 8028 patients with HF complicated by AKI. The 
XGBoost model outperformed the other models, achieving an AUC of 0.93 (95% 
confidence interval [CI]: 0.78-0.94; accuracy = 0.89), while neural network 
model showed the worst performance (AUC = 0.79, 95% CI: 0.77-0.82; accuracy = 
0.82). Decision curve analysis showed the superior net benefit of the XGBoost 
model within the 9% to 60% threshold probabilities. SHAP analysis was performed 
to identify the top 20 predictors, with age (mean SHAP value 1.29) and Glasgow 
Coma Scale score (mean SHAP value 1.24) emerging as significant factors.
CONCLUSIONS: Our interpretable model offers an enhanced ability to predict 
mortality risk in HF patients with AKI in ICUs. This model can be used to assist 
in formulating effective treatment plans and optimizing resource allocation.

目的: 开发一种可解释的机器学习模型，以提高心力衰竭（heart failure, HF）合并急性肾损伤（acute kidney injury, 
AKI）患者短期死亡率的早期预测准确性。
方法: 本回顾性队列研究利用了基于电子病历的公开大型数据库重症医学信息数据库MIMIC-Ⅳ（Medical Information Mart for 
Intensive Care Ⅳ, 版本2.0）。提取了患者入住ICU最初24 
h的数据，并将其分为训练集（80%）和验证集（20%）。利用沙普利可加性解释（Shapley additive explanation, 
SHAP）方法解释极端梯度提升（XGBoost）模型的工作原理，并识别关键的预后因素。使用曲线下面积（area under the curve, 
AUC）指标评估XGBoost模型的预测能力，并与3种其他机器学习模型进行比较，其解释性通过SHAP方法得到增强。
结果: 研究包括8028名合并AKI的HF患者。XGBoost模型的表现优于其他模型，达到了0.93的AUC〔95%置信区间（confidence 
interval, CI） 0.78～0.94，准确度=0.89〕，而神经网络的表现最差（AUC=0.79，95%CI 
0.77～0.82，准确度=0.82）。决策曲线分析显示XGBoost模型在9%至80%的阈值概率内具有更高的净收益。SHAP分析识别了前20个预测因素，年龄以及格拉斯哥昏迷评分被识别为重要的因素，SHAP平均值分别为1.29和1.24。
结论: 本研究开发的可解释模型提高了预测ICU内HF患者并发AKI的死亡风险的能力。这个模型不仅有助于制定有效的治疗计划，还能优化资源分配。

BACKGROUND: This study aimed to develop a higher performance nomogram based on 
explainable machine learning methods, and to predict the risk of death of stroke 
patients within 30 days based on clinical characteristics on the first day of 
intensive care units (ICU) admission.
METHODS: Data relating to stroke patients were extracted from the Medical 
Information Marketplace of the Intensive Care (MIMIC) IV and III database. The 
LightGBM machine learning approach together with Shapely additive explanations 
(termed as explain machine learning, EML) was used to select clinical features 
and define cut-off points for the selected features. These selected features and 
cut-off points were then evaluated using the Cox proportional hazards regression 
model and Kaplan-Meier survival curves. Finally, logistic regression-based 
nomograms for predicting 30-day mortality of stroke patients were constructed 
using original variables and variables dichotomized by cut-off points, 
respectively. The performance of two nomograms were evaluated in overall and 
individual dimension.
RESULTS: A total of 2982 stroke patients and 64 clinical features were included, 
and the 30-day mortality rate was 23.6% in the MIMIC-IV datasets. 10 variables 
("sofa (sepsis-related organ failure assessment)", "minimum glucose", "maximum 
sodium", "age", "mean spo2 (blood oxygen saturation)", "maximum temperature", 
"maximum heart rate", "minimum bun (blood urea nitrogen)", "minimum wbc (white 
blood cells)" and "charlson comorbidity index") and respective cut-off points 
were defined from the EML. In the Cox proportional hazards regression model (Cox 
regression) and Kaplan-Meier survival curves, after grouping stroke patients 
according to the cut-off point of each variable, patients belonging to the 
high-risk subgroup were associated with higher 30-day mortality than those in 
the low-risk subgroup. The evaluation of nomograms found that the EML-based 
nomogram not only outperformed the conventional nomogram in NIR (net 
reclassification index), brier score and clinical net benefits in overall 
dimension, but also significant improved in individual dimension especially for 
low "maximum temperature" patients.
CONCLUSIONS: The 10 selected first-day ICU admission clinical features require 
greater attention for stroke patients. And the nomogram based on explainable 
machine learning will have greater clinical application.

OBJECTIVE: This study aims to evaluate the association between the white blood 
cell-to-platelet ratio (WPR) and 28-day all-cause mortality among patients 
experiencing cardiac arrest.
METHODS: Utilizing data from 748 cardiac arrest patients in the Medical 
Information Mart for Intensive Care-IV (MIMIC-IV) 2.2 database, machine learning 
algorithms, including the Boruta feature selection method, random forest 
modeling, and SHAP value analysis, were applied to identify significant 
prognostic biomarkers. Key patient characteristics, encompassing demographic 
data, comorbidities, hematological and biochemical indices, and vital signs, 
were extracted using PostgreSQL Administration Tool (pgAdmin) software. The Cox 
proportional hazards model assessed the impact of WPR on mortality outcomes, 
while Kaplan-Meier survival curves and restricted cubic spline (RCS) analysis 
further validated the findings. Subgroup analyses stratified the prognostic 
value of WPR by demographic and clinical factors.
RESULTS: WPR demonstrated the highest prognostic significance among the 
variables studied, showing a strong association with 28-day all-cause mortality. 
In the unadjusted Model 1, hazard ratios (HRs) for WPR quartiles ranged from 
1.88 (95% CI: 1.22-2.90) in Q2 to 3.02 (95% CI: 2.04-4.47) in Q4 (Ptrend <0.05). 
Adjusted models (Models 2-4) confirmed the robustness of these associations, 
even after accounting for demographic and clinical covariates. Kaplan-Meier and 
RCS analyses revealed a significant U-shaped relationship between WPR and 
mortality risk. Subgroup analyses indicated that elevated WPR was particularly 
associated with increased mortality in males, elderly patients, married 
individuals, and those with chronic pulmonary disease.
CONCLUSION: WPR serves as an independent and reliable prognostic biomarker for 
28-day mortality in cardiac arrest patients. Its integration into clinical 
decision-making may enhance the early identification of high-risk patients and 
guide tailored therapeutic interventions.

Acute kidney injury (AKI) represents a significant challenge to global public 
health problem and is associated with poor outcomes. There is still considerable 
debate about the effect of mean blood glucose (MBG) and coefficient of variation 
(CV) of blood glucose on the short-term mortality of AKI patients. This 
retrospective cohort study aimed to explore the association between glycemic 
variability and short-term mortality in patients with AKI. Data from the Medical 
Information Mart for Intensive Care IV (MIMIC-IV) database were analyzed, 
including 6,777 adult AKI patients. MBG and CV on the first day of ICU admission 
were calculated to represent the overall glycemic status and variability during 
the ICU stay in AKI patients. The primary outcome indicator was ICU 30-day 
mortality of AKI patients. Multivariate Cox regression analysis and smoothed 
curve fitting were used to assess the relationship between blood glucose levels 
and mortality. Eventually, the ICU 30-day mortality rate of AKI patients was 
23.5%. The increased MBG and CV were significantly correlated with ICU 30-day 
mortality (hazards ratio (HR) = 1.20, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.14-1.27; 
HR = 1.08, 95% CI 1.03-1.13). The smoothed curve fitting showed a U-shaped 
relationship between MBG on the first day of ICU admission and ICU 30-day 
mortality (inflection point = 111.3 mg/dl), while CV had a linear relationship 
with 30-day ICU mortality. Thus, we conclude that MBG and CV were significantly 
associated with short-term mortality in intensive care patients with AKI. 
Tighter glycemic control may be an effective measure to improve the prognosis of 
patients with AKI.

BACKGROUND: Epidemiological studies have demonstrated an association between red 
blood cell distribution width (RDW) and the prognosis of pneumonia-associated 
diseases. However, prognostic value of RDW in patients with 
ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) has yet to be investigated. This study 
aimed to explore the association between RDW and in-hospital mortality in VAP 
patients and explore predictive value of RDW for VAP patients.
METHODS: This retrospective cohort study included 1,543 VAP patients from the 
Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care IV database 2008-2019. The primary 
outcome was considered to 30-day in-hospital mortality of VAP patients in this 
study. Non-high RDW level group was defined as <15 %, and high RDW level group 
as ≥15%. The possible confounding factors were screened by least absolute 
shrinkage and selection operator regression. Univariate and multivariate COX 
regression analyses were used for the assessment on the association of RDW and 
30-day in-hospital mortality in VAP patients. We also performed subgroup 
analyses. Furthermore, a comparative analysis of RDW and sequential organ 
failure assessment (SOFA) score and simplified acute physiology score II (SAPS 
II) were performed by receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves.
RESULTS: The 30-day in-hospital mortality of VAP patients was approximately 
19.05%. After adjusting all confounding factors, high RDW was associated with 
30-day in-hospital mortality among VAP patients by using non-high RDW as the 
reference [hazard ratio (HR) =1.29, 95% confidence interval (CI): 1.01-1.63]. 
Additionally, the relationship was also robust in several populations, such as 
patients were younger than 60 years, or had not a history of congestive heart 
failure, or had a history of sepsis, or had not received renal replacement 
therapy, or had a duration of mechanical ventilation for more than 7 days. The 
result of ROC indicated that RDW had a better prognostic value in predicting 
30-day in-hospital mortality for VAP patients than SOFA score and SAPS II score.
CONCLUSION: High RDW level is associated with an increased 30-day in-hospital 
mortality. The RDW is a promising biomarker in predicting 30-day in-hospital 
mortality for patients admitted to the ICU, regardless of VAP.

OBJECTIVES: Although platelets have been linked to inflammatory development in 
sepsis, knowledge on their role as an indicator in sepsis treatment is scarce. 
Here, we investigated the association between time-dependent changes in platelet 
counts with mortality rates to reveal the role of platelets in sepsis therapy.
DESIGN: A retrospective cohort study.
SETTING: We screened the Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care (MIMIC-IV), 
a public database comprising data from critical care subjects at the Beth Israel 
Deaconess Medical Center (BIDMC) in Boston, Massachusetts, USA.
PARTICIPANTS: A total of 7981 patients, who were admitted to the BIDMC between 
2008 and 2019, were analysed based on Sepsis-3 criteria from MIMIC-IV.
PRIMARY AND SECONDARY OUTCOME MEASURES: Primary and secondary outcomes included 
30-day mortality after admission and length of intensive care unit (ICU) stay 
and hospitalisation, respectively.
RESULTS: Patients with ≤10% reduction in proportion of platelet counts were 
associated with significantly lower 30-day mortality (14.1% vs 23.5%, p<0.001, 
Kaplan-Meier analysis, p<0.0001). Multivariable analysis revealed that decreased 
platelet-count percentage ≤10% on day 4 after ICU admission was associated with 
lower probability of 30-day non-survival (OR=0.73, 95% CI 0.64 to 0.82, 
p＜0.001). Patients in the ≤10% group had significantly shorter ICU stays than 
those in the >10% group (6.8 vs 7.5, p＜0.001). Restricted cubic spline curves 
revealed that mortality rates decreased with increase in proportion of platelet 
counts.
CONCLUSIONS: A ≤10% decrease in platelet-count percentage among sepsis patients 
after treatments is independently associated with decreased 30-day mortality, 
suggesting that changes in proportion of platelet counts after treatments could 
be an indicator for assessing the therapeutic effects of sepsis.

The high mortality rate in sepsis patients is related to sepsis-associated liver 
injury (SALI). We sought to develop an accurate forecasting nomogram to estimate 
individual 90-day mortality in SALI patients. Data from 34,329 patients 
were extracted from the public Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care 
(MIMIC-IV) database. SALI was defined by total bilirubin (TBIL) > 2 mg/dL and 
the occurrence of an international normalized ratio (INR) > 1.5 in the presence 
of sepsis. Logistic regression analysis was performed to establish a prediction 
model called the nomogram based on the training set (n = 727), which was 
subsequently subjected to internal validation. Multivariate logistic regression 
analysis showed that SALI was an independent risk factor for mortality in 
patients with sepsis. The Kaplan‒Meier curves for 90-day survival were different 
between the SALI and non-SALI groups after propensity score matching (PSM) (log 
rank: P < 0.001 versus P = 0.038), regardless of PSM balance. The nomogram 
demonstrated better discrimination than the sequential organ failure assessment 
(SOFA) score, logistic organ dysfunction system (LODS) score, simplified acute 
physiology II (SAPS II) score, and Albumin-Bilirubin (ALBI) score in the 
training and validation sets, with areas under the receiver operating 
characteristic curve (AUROC) of 0.778 (95% CI 0.730-0.799, P < 0.001) and 0.804 
(95% CI 0.713-0.820, P < 0.001), respectively. The calibration plot showed that 
the nomogram was sufficiently successful to predict the probability of 90-day 
mortality in both groups. The DCA of the nomogram demonstrated a higher net 
benefit regarding clinical usefulness than SOFA, LODS, SAPSII, and ALBI scores 
in the two groups. The nomogram performs exceptionally well in predicting the 
90-day mortality rate in SALI patients, which can be used to assess the 
prognosis of patients with SALI and may assist in guiding clinical practice to 
enhance patient outcomes.

Background: This study aims to assess the prognostic value of red blood cell 
distribution width-to-platelet ratio (RPR) in acute respiratory distress 
syndrome (ARDS) patients. Methods: The data collected from 540 ARDS patients 
from 2001 to 2012 were obtained from the Medical Information Mart for Intensive 
Care III Database. The 28-day all-cause mortality risk was considered as the 
primary outcome parameter, and the secondary outcomes were 60- and 90-day 
all-cause mortality. The association between RPR (≥0.19 vs. <0.19) and mortality 
was assessed by Cox proportional hazards models, and potential nonlinear 
associations were assessed by restricted cubic spline regression analysis. 
Results: The 28-day all-cause mortality was 22.4%. Among the 121 deaths, 92 
(20.0%) presented with an RPR <0.19, and 29 patients had RPR ≥0.19 ( P < 0.001). 
The 60- and 90-day all-cause mortality was 27% and 28.7%, respectively. After 
adjusting for the relevant factors in the multivariate model, RPR ≥0.19 was 
independently correlated with the 28-day all-cause mortality (hazard ratio, 
2.74; 95% confidence interval, 1.46-5.15; P = 0.002). There was no nonlinear 
relationship between RPR and the risk of 28-day all-cause mortality ( P for 
overall association <0.001, P for nonlinear = 0.635). Similar results were 
observed for both the pneumonia and nonpneumonia subgroups and sensitivity 
analyses. Conclusions: The data promote the use of RPR as a valuable prognostic 
indicator for ARDS patients.

Coronary heart disease (CHD) is a common comorbidity in intensive care unit 
(ICU) patients, particularly in the elderly. This particular population may have 
worse conditions during sepsis, and it presents an overwhelming challenge for 
clinical practice. Previous studies suggested that patients with CHD have an 
increased risk of cardiovascular events, and low albumin concentration worsens 
the prognosis of patients with stable CHD. Hypoalbuminemia in patients with 
sepsis is common due to nutritional disorders, excessive consumption, and 
leakage. Albumin is a fluid often used for resuscitation in patients with 
sepsis. However, albumin infusion in patients with sepsis and CHD has rarely 
been studied. The effects and safety of albumin infusion in patients with sepsis 
and CHD remain unclear. Therefore, we collected medical information from 
Mimic-III (Mimic-III) and compared the all-cause mortality and cardiovascular 
mortality at 28- or 90-day between the albumin and non-albumin groups in septic 
patients with CHD. A total of 2,027 patients with sepsis and CHD were included 
in our study, with 405 in the albumin group and 1,622 in the non-albumin group. 
After propensity score matching (PSM), 350 pairs were included in our study. 
Improved survival benefits were found in the albumin group at the 28-day 
all-cause mortality compared with the non-albumin group (hazard ratio [HR], 
0.54; 95% CI: 0.38-0.78; p = 0.0009). However, no difference was detected in the 
90-day survival benefits (HR, 0.80, 95% CI: 0.60-1.06, p = 0.1207). Albumin 
infusion did not reverse cardiovascular mortality neither at 28th day nor at 
90th day (cardiovascular mortality: 28 days, HR, 0.52, 95% CI: 0.23-1.19, p = 
0.1218; 90 days, HR, 0.66, 95% CI: 0.33-1.33, p = 0.2420).

BACKGROUND: Previous studies have shown that inflammation plays an important 
role in atherosclerosis and cardiovascular disease. Platelet to lymphocyte ratio 
(PLR) has been reported as a novel inflammatory marker. However, it is not clear 
whether PLR is associated with short-term all-cause mortality in critically ill 
patients with non-ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI).
METHODS: The data for the study is from the Medical Information Mart for 
Intensive Care III database. The primary outcome in our study was 28-day 
mortality. Kapan-Meier curve, lowess smoother curve, and multivariate Cox 
regression models were used to determine whether the association between PLR and 
28-day mortality of critically ill patients with NSTEMI.
RESULTS: A total of 1273 critically ill patients with NSTEMI were included in 
this analysis. Kapan-Meier curve and lowess smoother curve show that high PLR is 
associated with an increased risk of 28-day all-cause mortality. The study 
population is divided into two groups according to the cut-off value of PLR 
level. In the Cox model, high PLR levels (PLR≥195.8) were significantly 
associated with increased 28-day mortality (HR 1.54; 95%CI 1.09-2.18, p = .013). 
In quartile analyses, the HR (95% CI) for the third (183 ≤ PLR < 306) and fourth 
quartile (PLR≥306) was 1.55 (1.05-2.29) and 1.61 (1.03-2.52), respectively, 
compared to the reference group(111 ≤ PLR < 183). In subgroup analyses, there is 
no interaction effect in most of the subgroups except for respiratory failure 
and vasopressor use.
CONCLUSION: High PLR is associated with an increased risk of short-term 
mortality in critically ill patients with NSTEMI.

BACKGROUND: There has been considerable controversy between sepsis-1 and 
sepsis-3 criteria.
METHODS: Patients with infection meeting two or more systemic inflammatory 
response syndrome (SIRS) criteria (sepsis-1) or a Sequential Organ Failure 
Assessment (SOFA) score ≥ 2 (sepsis-3) on the first day after ICU admission were 
selected from the Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care-III database, and 
their outcomes were compared using all-cause death as the end point. Subgroup 
analysis was also performed based on prior chronic organ dysfunction.
RESULTS: There were 21,491 infected patients included. Of those meeting the 
diagnostic criteria for sepsis-1, 13.42% did not satisfy sepsis-3 criteria, and 
this population had a 21-day mortality rate of 6.96%. In contrast, 7.00% of the 
patients meeting sepsis-3 criteria did not meet sepsis-1 criteria, and their 
21-day mortality rate was 10.76%. When excluding preexisting organ conditions, 
18.41% of patients with sepsis-1 did not meet sepsis-3 criteria, with a 21-day 
mortality rate of 6.39%, and 6.00% of patients with sepsis-3 did not meet 
sepsis-1 criteria, with a 21-day mortality rate of 9.11%. When two or more SIRS 
criteria or SOFA score ≥ 2 were applied to predict 21-day all-cause mortality in 
infected patients without prior chronic organ dysfunction, the sensitivity was 
96.0% or 91.0%, respectively. Although the areas under the receiver operator 
curve of both SOFA and SIRS criteria could be used for predicting mortality, 
SOFA score represented the severity of the condition, whereas SIRS score 
represented a clinically evident host response to infection.
CONCLUSIONS: Sepsis-3 diagnostic criteria narrow the sepsis population at the 
expense of sensitivity, and the resulting false negatives may delay disease 
diagnosis. It may be inappropriate to compare the prediction performance of SIRS 
and SOFA criteria when sepsis-3 is defined.

BACKGROUND: Frailty is a risk factor for acute myocardial infarction (AMI). This 
study examined the association between the modified frailty index (MFI) and 
adverse outcomes in patients with critical AMI.
METHODS: Data were obtained from the Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care 
IV database. Logistic and Cox regression models and a competing risk model were 
applied.
RESULTS: Of 5003 patients, 1496 were non-frail and 3507 were frail. Frailty was 
significantly associated with in-hospital mortality (per point, OR 1.13, 95% CI: 
1.05-1.21; frail vs non-frail, OR 1.31, 95% CI: 1.04-1.65) and 1-year mortality 
(per point, HR 1.15, 95% CI: 1.11-1.20; frail vs non-frail, HR 1.37, 95% CI: 
1.20-1.58). Frailty was significantly associated with post-discharge care needs 
(per point, OR 1.23, 95% CI: 1.14-1.33; frail vs non-frail, OR 1.47, 95% CI: 
1.22-1.78). In the competing risk models, frailty was significantly associated 
with a lower probability of being discharged from the ICU (per point, HR 0.87, 
95% CI: 0.85-0.90; frail vs non-frail, HR 0.73, 95% CI: 0.68-0.79) and hospital 
(per point, HR 0.82, 95% CI: 0.80-0.85; frail vs non-frail, HR 0.62, 95% CI: 
0.57-0.68). Subgroup analyses showed the association of frailty with in-hospital 
and 1-year mortality was stronger in patients with a SOFA score ≤2 than in those 
with a SOFA score >2 (both p<0.05 for interaction).
CONCLUSION: Frailty assessed by the MFI was an independent predictor of adverse 
outcomes in patients with critical AMI and may be helpful for prognostic risk 
stratification.

OBJECTIVE: Lung is often implicated in sepsis, resulting in acute respiratory 
distress syndrome (ARDS). The alveolar-arterial oxygen gradient [D(A-a)O2 ] 
reflects lung diffusing capacity, which is usually compromised in ARDS. But 
whether D(A-a)O2 impacts the prognosis of patients with sepsis remains to be 
explored. Our study aims to investigate the association between D(A-a)O2 and 
28-day mortality in patients with sepsis using a large sample, multicenter 
Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care (MIMIC)-IV database.
METHODS: We extracted a data of 35 010 patients with sepsis from the 
retrospective cohort MIMIC-IV database, by which the independent effects of 
D(A-a)O2 on 28-day death risk was investigated, with D(A-a)O2 as being the 
exposure variable and 28-day fatality being the outcome variable. Binary 
logistic regression and a two-piecewise linear model were employed to explore 
the relationship between D(A-a)O2 and the 28-day death risk after confounding 
factors were optimized including demographic indicators, Charlson comorbidity 
index (CCI), Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (SOFA) score, drug 
administration, and vital signs.
RESULTS: A total of 18 933 patients were finally included in our analysis. The 
patients' average age was 66.67 ± 16.01 years, and the mortality at 28 days was 
19.23% (3640/18933). Multivariate analysis demonstrated that each 10-mmHg rise 
of D(A-a)O2 was linked with a 3% increase in the probability of death at 28 days 
either in the unadjusted model or in adjustment for demographic variables (Odds 
ratio [OR]: 1.03, 95% CI: 1.02 to 1.03). But, each 10 mmHg increase in D(A-a)O2 
was associated with a 3% increase of death (OR: 1.03, 95% CI: 1.023 to 1.033) in 
the case of adjustment for all covariants. Through smoothed curve fitting and 
generalized summation models, we found that non-linear relationship existed 
between D(A-a)O2 and the death at 28-day, which demonstrated that D(A-a)O2 had 
no any impacts on the prognosis of patients with sepsis when D(A-a)O2 was less 
than or equal to 300 mmHg, but once D(A-a)O2 exceeded 300 mmHg, however, every 
10 mmHg elevation of D(A-a)O2 is accompanied by a 5% increase of the 28-day 
death (OR: 1.05; 95% CI:1.04 to 1.05, p < 0.0001).
CONCLUSION: Our findings suggests that D(A-a)O2 is a valuable indicator for the 
management of sepsis patient, and it is recommended that D(A-a)O2 be maintained 
less than 300 mmHg as far as possible during sepsis process.

Triglyceride-glucose (TyG) index has emerged as a novel biomarker for detecting 
insulin resistance (IR) and has been proven to be associated with various 
diseases. However, its correlation with the prognosis of severe sepsis remains 
unraveled. This retrospective cohort study utilized patient records from the 
Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care (MIMIC-IV, version 2.2) to examine 
the outcomes of patients with sepsis. The primary outcomes were hospital 
mortality and intensive care unit (ICU) mortality. The correlation between the 
TyG index and outcomes was evaluated through the Kaplan-Meier method, the 
Log-rank test, and univariate and multivariate Cox regression analyses. 
Additionally, restricted cubic spline (RCS) regression analysis was employed to 
delve into the nonlinear relationship between baseline TyG index and outcomes, 
with trend significance assessed through quartile levels. Subgroup analyses were 
conducted to evaluate the consistency of the TyG index's prognostic value across 
various influencing factors. The study included 1,742 patients with sepsis 
requiring intensive care. The in-hospital mortality rate was 19.75% (344/1,742), 
and the ICU mortality rate was 14.75% (257/1,742). Cox regression analysis 
revealed that, in comparison to the first quartile (Q1), patients in the fourth 
quartile (Q4) had a 63% higher risk of in-hospital mortality (HR 1.63 [95% CI 
1.22 to 2.18], P < 0.01) and a 79% higher risk of ICU mortality (HR 1.79 [95% CI 
1.28 to 2.51], P < 0.001). Model 3 showed that ICU mortality risks for Q4, Q3, 
and Q2 were 240%, 75%, and 33% higher, respectively (HR 3.40 [95% CI 2.24 to 
5.16], P < 0.001; HR 1.75 [95% CI 1.16 to 2.63], P = 0.007; HR 1.33 [95% CI 1.20 
to 1.53], P < 0.001). RCS regression analysis identified a nonlinear association 
between the TyG index and mortality (overall P < 0.001; P for 
nonlinearity < 0.001, with an inflection point at 8.9). Subgroup analysis showed 
that the effect size and direction were consistent across different subgroups, 
suggesting the stability of the results. This study demonstrates that a higher 
TyG index is significantly associated with increased in-hospital and ICU 
mortality risk in critically ill sepsis patients, with evidence of non-linear 
correlation. Therefore, the TyG index helps identify the mortality prognosis of 
sepsis patients in the ICU.

BACKGROUND: Acute kidney injury (AKI) is the most common and serious 
complication of sepsis, accompanied by high mortality and disease burden. The 
early prediction of AKI is critical for timely intervention and ultimately 
improves prognosis. This study aims to establish and validate predictive models 
based on novel machine learning (ML) algorithms for AKI in critically ill 
patients with sepsis.
METHODS: Data of patients with sepsis were extracted from the Medical 
Information Mart for Intensive Care III (MIMIC- III) database. Feature selection 
was performed using a Boruta algorithm. ML algorithms such as logistic 
regression (LR), k-nearest neighbors (KNN), support vector machine (SVM), 
decision tree, random forest, Extreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost), and 
artificial neural network (ANN) were applied for model construction by utilizing 
tenfold cross-validation. The performances of these models were assessed in 
terms of discrimination, calibration, and clinical application. Moreover, the 
discrimination of ML-based models was compared with those of Sequential Organ 
Failure Assessment (SOFA) and the customized Simplified Acute Physiology Score 
(SAPS) II model.
RESULTS: A total of 3176 critically ill patients with sepsis were included for 
analysis, of which 2397 cases (75.5%) developed AKI during hospitalization. A 
total of 36 variables were selected for model construction. The models of LR, 
KNN, SVM, decision tree, random forest, ANN, XGBoost, SOFA and SAPS II score 
were established and obtained area under the receiver operating characteristic 
curves of 0.7365, 0.6637, 0.7353, 0.7492, 0.7787, 0.7547, 0.821, 0.6457 and 
0.7015, respectively. The XGBoost model had the best predictive performance in 
terms of discrimination, calibration, and clinical application among all models.
CONCLUSION: The ML models can be reliable tools for predicting AKI in septic 
patients. The XGBoost model has the best predictive performance, which can be 
used to assist clinicians in identifying high-risk patients and implementing 
early interventions to reduce mortality.

Background: So far, no study has investigated the effects of plasma transfusion 
in the patients with sepsis, especially in the terms of prognosis. Therefore, we 
aimed to explore the association of early fresh frozen plasma (FFP) transfusion 
with the outcomes of patients with sepsis. Methods: We performed a cohort study 
using data extracted from the Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care III 
database (v1.4). External validation was obtained from the First Affiliated 
Hospital of Wenzhou Medical University, China. We adopted the Sepsis-3 criteria 
to extract the patients with sepsis and septic shock. The occurrence of 
transfusion during the first 3-days of intensive care unit (ICU) stay was 
regarded as early FFP transfusion. The primary outcome was 28-day mortality. We 
assessed the association of early FFP transfusion with the patient outcomes 
using a Cox regression analysis. Furthermore, we performed the sensitivity 
analysis, subset analysis, and external validation to verify the true strength 
of the results. Results: After adjusting for the covariates in the three models, 
respectively, the significantly higher risk of death in the FFP transfusion 
group at 28-days [e.g., Model 2: hazard ratio (HR) = 1.361, P = 0.018, 95% CI = 
1.054-1.756] and 90-days (e.g., Model 2: HR = 1.368, P = 0.005, 95% CI = 
1.099-1.704) remained distinct. Contrarily, the mortality increased 
significantly with the increase of FFP transfusion volume. The outcomes of the 
patients with sepsis with hypocoagulable state after early FFP transfusion were 
not significantly improved. Similar results can also be found in the subset 
analysis of the septic shock cohort. The results of external validation 
exhibited good consistency. Conclusions: Our study provides a new understanding 
of the rationale and effectiveness of FFP transfusion for the patients with 
sepsis. After recognizing the evidence of risk-benefit and cost-benefit, it is 
important to reduce the inappropriate use of FFP and avoid unnecessary adverse 
transfusion reactions.

Serum anion gap (AG) is closely related to mortality in critically ill patients 
with several diseases. We aimed to determine the relationship between serum AG 
levels and 28-day intensive care unit (ICU) mortality in patients with diastolic 
heart failure (DHF). This cohort study enrolled critically ill patients with DHF 
from the Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care IV (MIMIC-IV) database. 
Serum AG levels were calculated using the traditional and albumin-adjusted 
methods. Multivariate Cox proportional hazards regression and restricted cubic 
spline curves were used to determine the correlation between serum AG levels and 
28-day ICU mortality. We used receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves and 
area under the curve (AUC) to compare the ability of traditional and 
albumin-adjusted AG to predict mortality. Overall, 3290 patients were included. 
Multivariate analysis showed an association of high levels of traditional 
(hazard ratio [HR], 1.48; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.1-1.98, p = 0.009) and 
albumin-adjusted AG (HR, 1.36; 95% CI, 1.02-1.79, p = 0.033) with higher risk of 
28-day ICU mortality. Restricted cubic spline curves indicated a linear 
relationship between AG level and 28-day ICU mortality. Comparison of the ROC 
curves revealed that albumin-adjusted AG had a greater ability to predict 28-day 
ICU mortality compared with traditional AG (AUCs of 0.569 [95% CI, 0.536-0.601] 
and 0.619 [95% CI, 0.588-0.649], respectively). In ICU patients with DHF, higher 
levels of traditional and albumin-adjusted AG were associated with higher 28-day 
ICU mortality. Albumin-adjusted AG exhibited greater predictive ability for 
mortality compared with traditional AG.

BACKGROUND: Hepatic encephalopathy (HE) is associated with marked increases in 
morbidity and mortality for cirrhosis patients. This study aimed to develop and 
validate machine learning (ML) models to predict 28-day mortality for patients 
with HE.
METHODS: A retrospective cohort study was conducted in the Medical Information 
Mart for Intensive Care (MIMIC)-IV database. Patients from MIMIC-IV were 
randomized into training and validation cohorts in a ratio of 7:3. Training 
cohort was used for establishing the model while validation cohort was used for 
validation. The outcome was defined as 28-day mortality. Predictors were 
identified by recursive feature elimination (RFE) within 24 h of intensive care 
unit (ICU) admission. The area under the curve (AUC) and calibration curve were 
used to determine the predictive performance of different ML models.
RESULTS: In the MIMIC-IV database, 601 patients were eventually diagnosed with 
HE. Of these, 112 (18.64%) experienced death within 28 days. Acute physiology 
score III (APSIII), sepsis related organ failure assessment (SOFA), 
international normalized ratio (INR), total bilirubin (TBIL), albumin, blood 
urea nitrogen (BUN), acute kidney injury (AKI) and mechanical ventilation were 
identified as independent risk factors. Validation set indicated that the 
artificial neural network (NNET) model had the highest AUC of 0.837 (95% 
CI:0.774-0.901). Furthermore, in the calibration curve, the NNET model was also 
well-calibrated (P = 0.323), which means that it can better predict the 28-day 
mortality in HE patients. Additionally, the performance of the NNET is superior 
to existing scores, including Model for End-Stage Liver Disease (MELD) and Model 
for End-Stage Liver Disease-Sodium (MELD-Na).
CONCLUSIONS: In this study, the NNET model demonstrated better discrimination in 
predicting 28-day mortality as compared to other models. This developed model 
could potentially improve the early detection of HE with high mortality, 
subsequently improving clinical outcomes in these patients with HE, but further 
external prospective validation is still required.

Sedative and analgesic drugs are commonly used in the diagnosis and treatment of 
cancer patients. Analyzing the impact of these drugs on the prognosis of cancer 
patients can help improve patient outcomes. This study aimed to analyze the use 
of propofol, benzodiazepines, and opioids on the survival of cancer patients in 
the intensive care unit (ICU) based on the Medical Information Mart for 
Intensive Care III (MIMIC-III) database. A total of 2,567 cancer patients from 
the MIMIC-III database between 2001 and 2012 were included in this retrospective 
cohort study. Logistic regression analyses were utilized to assess the 
relationship between propofol, benzodiazepine, and opioid and survival in cancer 
patients. The follow-up was 1 year from the patient's first admission to the 
ICU. Outcomes were ICU mortality, 28-day mortality, and 1-year mortality. 
Stratified analyses were based on patients' metastatic status. The use of 
propofol [odds ratio (OR) = 0.66; 95% confidence interval (CI), 0.53-0.80] and 
opioids (OR = 0.65; 95%CI, 0.54-0.79) were associated with a decreased risk of 
1-year mortality. Both benzodiazepines and opioids use were related to an 
increased risk of ICU mortality and 28-day mortality (all P < 0.05), whereas 
propofol use was associated with a decreased risk of 28-day mortality 
(OR = 0.59; 95%CI, 0.45-0.78). Compared with the use of benzodiazepines combined 
with opioids, patients who used propofol and opioids were related to a decreased 
risk of 1-year mortality (OR = 0.74; 95%CI, 0.55-0.98). Similar results were 
found in patients with metastasis and metastasis-free. Cancer patients who used 
propofol may experience a lower risk of mortality than benzodiazepine use.

BACKGROUND: The incidence of cervical spine fractures is increasing every day, 
causing a huge burden on society. This study aimed to develop and verify a 
nomogram to predict the in-hospital mortality of patients with cervical spine 
fractures without spinal cord injury. This could help clinicians understand the 
clinical outcome of such patients at an early stage and make appropriate 
decisions to improve their prognosis.
METHODS: This study included 394 patients with cervical spine fractures from the 
Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care III database, and 40 clinical 
indicators of each patient on the first day of admission to the intensive care 
unit were collected. The independent risk factors were screened using the Least 
Absolute Shrinkage and Selection Operator regression analysis method, a 
multi-factor logistic regression model was established, nomograms were 
developed, and internal validation was performed. A receiver operating 
characteristic (ROC) curve was drawn, and the area under the ROC curve (AUC), 
net reclassification improvement (NRI), and integrated discrimination 
improvement (IDI) were calculated to evaluate the discrimination of the model. 
Moreover, the consistency between the actual probability and predicted 
probability was reflected using the calibration curve and Hosmer-Lemeshow (HL) 
test. A decision curve analysis (DCA) was performed, and the nomogram was 
compared with the scoring system commonly used in clinical practice to evaluate 
the clinical net benefit.
RESULTS: The nomogram indicators included the systolic blood pressure, oxygen 
saturation, respiratory rate, bicarbonate, and simplified acute physiology score 
(SAPS) II. The results showed that our model had satisfactory predictive 
ability, with an AUC of 0.907 (95% confidence interval [CI] = 0.853-0.961) and 
0.856 (95% CI = 0.746-0.967) in the training set and validation set, 
respectively. Compared with the SAPS-II system, the NRI values of the training 
and validation sets of our model were 0.543 (95% CI = 0.147-0.940) and 0.784 
(95% CI = 0.282-1.286), respectively. The IDI values of the training and 
validation sets were 0.064 (95% CI = 0.004-0.123; P = 0.037) and 0.103 (95% 
CI = 0.002-0.203; P = 0.046), respectively. The calibration plot and HL test 
results confirmed that our model prediction results showed good agreement with 
the actual results, where the HL test values of the training and validation sets 
were P = 0.8 and P = 0.95, respectively. The DCA curve revealed that our model 
had better clinical net benefit than the SAPS-II system.
CONCLUSION: We explored the in-hospital mortality of patients with cervical 
spine fractures without spinal cord injury and constructed a nomogram to predict 
their prognosis. This could help doctors assess the patient's status and 
implement interventions to improve prognosis accordingly.

BACKGROUND: Among patients with acute coronary syndrome and percutaneous 
coronary intervention, stress hyperglycemia ratio (SHR) is primarily associated 
with short-term unfavorable outcomes. However, the relationship between SHR and 
long-term worsen prognosis in acute myocardial infarction (AMI) patients 
admitted in intensive care unit (ICU) are not fully investigated, especially in 
those with different ethnicity. This study aimed to clarify the association of 
SHR with all-cause mortality in critical AMI patients from American and Chinese 
cohorts.
METHODS: Overall 4,337 AMI patients with their first ICU admission from the 
American Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care (MIMIC)-IV database 
(n = 2,166) and Chinese multicenter registry cohort Cardiorenal ImprovemeNt II 
(CIN-II, n = 2,171) were included in this study. The patients were divided into 
4 groups based on quantiles of SHR in both two cohorts.
RESULTS: The total mortality was 23.8% (maximum follow-up time: 12.1 years) in 
American MIMIC-IV and 29.1% (maximum follow-up time: 14.1 years) in Chinese 
CIN-II. In MIMIC-IV cohort, patients with SHR of quartile 4 had higher risk of 
1-year (adjusted hazard radio [aHR] = 1.87; 95% CI: 1.40-2.50) and long-term 
(aHR = 1.63; 95% CI: 1.27-2.09) all-cause mortality than quartile 2 (as 
reference). Similar results were observed in CIN-II cohort (1-year mortality: 
aHR = 1.44; 95%CI: 1.03-2.02; long-term mortality: aHR = 1.32; 95%CI: 
1.05-1.66). In both two group, restricted cubic splines indicated a J-shaped 
correlation between SHR and all-cause mortality. In subgroup analysis, SHR was 
significantly associated with higher 1-year and long-term all-cause mortality 
among patients without diabetes in both MIMIC-IV and CIN-II cohort.
CONCLUSION: Among critical AMI patients, elevated SHR is significantly 
associated with and 1-year and long-term all-cause mortality, especially in 
those without diabetes, and the results are consistently in both American and 
Chinese cohorts.

BACKGROUND: The glucose-to-glycated hemoglobin ratio (GAR) represents stress 
hyperglycemia, which has been closely associated with adverse outcomes in 
cardio-cerebrovascular diseases. No studies have examined the association 
between stress hyperglycemia and atrial fibrillation (AF) in critically ill 
patients. This study aims to explore the relationship between GAR and the 
prognosis of critically ill patients with AF.
METHODS: A retrospective cohort of patients was selected from the Medical 
Information Mart for Intensive Care IV (MIMIC-IV) database. The GAR was 
calculated based on fasting blood glucose and glycated hemoglobin levels 
measured after admission. The primary outcome was the 30-day mortality rate, 
with secondary outcomes being the 90-day and 365-day mortality rates. The GAR 
was divided into tertiles, and Kaplan-Meier analysis was employed to compare 
differences in mortality rates between groups. The Cox proportional hazards 
model and restricted cubic splines (RCS) were utilized to evaluate the 
relationship between the GAR and mortality. Subsequently, a segmented regression 
model was constructed to analyze threshold effects in cases where nonlinear 
relationships were determined.
RESULTS: In this cohort, the second tertile of the GAR exhibited lower mortality 
rates at 30 days (10.56% vs 6.33% vs 14.51%), 90 days (17.11% vs 10.09% vs 
17.88%), and 365 days (25.30% vs 16.15% vs 22.72%). In the third tertile, the 
risk of mortality at 30 days increased by 165% (HR = 2.65, 95% CI 1.99-3.54, 
p < 0.001), at 90 days increased by 113% (HR = 2.13, 95% CI 1.68-2.70, 
p < 0.001), and at 365 days increased by 70% (HR = 1.70, 95% CI 1.68-2.70, 
p < 0.001). The association between the GAR and patient mortality demonstrated a 
"J-shaped" non-linear correlation. Once the GAR exceeded 15.915, each 
incremental unit increase in the ratio was associated with a 27.2% increase in 
the risk of 30-day mortality in critically ill atrial fibrillation patients 
(HR = 1.262, 95% CI 1.214-1.333, p < 0.001).
CONCLUSION: The GAR is associated with both short-term and long-term mortality 
in critically ill patients with AF in a J-shaped relationship. Both low and 
excessively high GAR values indicate poor prognosis.

OBJECTIVE: Red blood cell distribution width (RDW) is a predictor of adverse 
outcomes in aortic aneurysms. Recent recommendations suggest that combining RDW 
with other biomarkers could yield better results. We, therefore, propose 
evaluating the biomarker of vascular aging, albumin with RDW to predict the risk 
of aortic aneurysms. This study aims to explore whether the combination of RDW 
with albumin can effectively predict the prognosis of aortic aneurysm patients.
METHODS: This retrospective cohort study was conducted among adults (age >18) 
with aortic aneurysms in the Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care 
Database III V1.4 (MIMIC-III). RAR was measured according to the red blood cell 
distribution width and albumin. The primary outcome was the 30-day mortality 
rate, and the secondary outcome was the 90-day and one-year mortality rates. 
Estimation of hazard ratios (HR) was obtained from Cox regression models for 
all-cause mortality related to red cell distribution width-to-albumin ratio 
(RAR) values.
RESULTS: In total, 312 patients were involved, with an average age of 74.9 ± 
10.9 years and an average RAR value of 5.4 ± 1.6 mL/g. In 30 days for all-cause 
mortality, the HR (95% CI) in the highest RAR group (>5.8 mL/g) in tertiles was 
2.54 (1.25, 5.14) in the unadjusted model, with a significant difference 
compared with the reference group (P < 0.05). After adjusting for race, gender 
and age, there was still a correlation (P < 0.05), and the HR (95% CI) was 2.51 
(1.23, 5.10). Further adjustment of possible covariates showed similar 
correlation in model 3 (P < 0.05), and HR (95% CI) was 2.66 (1.17, 6.01). 
Multivariable logistic regression shows that RAR is an independent risk factor 
for the outcome of aortic aneurysms after adjusting the covariates. In the 
subgroup analysis, we analyzed the patient's complications, and no significant 
interaction was observed.
CONCLUSION: RAR is a risk factor for patients with aortic aneurysms. However, 
more in-depth research is warranted to further analyze and substantiate our 
findings on the role of RAR in aortic aneurysm patients.

BACKGROUND: Atrial fibrillation (AF) portends poor prognoses in intensive care 
unit patients with sepsis. However, AF research is challenging: Previous studies 
demonstrate that International Classification of Disease (ICD) codes may 
underestimate the incidence of AF, but chart review is expensive and often not 
feasible. We aim to examine the accuracy of nurse-charted AF and its temporal 
precision in critical care patients with sepsis.
METHODS: Patients with sepsis with continuous electrocardiogram (ECG) waveforms 
were identified from the Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care (MIMIC-III) 
database, a de-identified, single-center intensive care unit electronic health 
record (EHR) source. We selected a random sample of ECGs of 6 to 50 hours' 
duration for manual review. Nurse-charted AF occurrence and onset time and 
ICD-9-coded AF were compared to gold-standard ECG adjudication by a 
board-certified cardiac electrophysiologist blinded to AF status. Descriptive 
statistics were calculated for all variables in patients diagnosed with AF by 
nurse charting, ICD-9 code, or both.
RESULTS: From 142 ECG waveforms (58 AF and 84 sinus rhythm), nurse charting 
identified AF events with 93% sensitivity (95% confidence interval [CI]: 
87%-100%) and 87% specificity (95% CI: 80%-94%) compared to the gold standard 
manual ECG review. Furthermore, nurse-charted AF onset time was within 1 hour of 
expert reader onset time for 85% of the reviewed tracings. The ICD-9 codes were 
97% sensitive (95% CI: 88-100%) and 82% specific (95% CI: 74-90%) for incident 
AF during admission but unable to identify AF time of onset.
CONCLUSION: Nurse documentation of AF in EHR is accurate and has high precision 
for determining AF onset to within 1 hour. Our study suggests that nurse-charted 
AF in the EHR represents a potentially novel method for AF case identification, 
timing, and burden estimation.

BACKGROUND: Lactate was a prognostic indicator for acute myocardial infarction 
(AMI) patients. However, the association between normalized lactate load, 
representing hypoxic burden over time, and in-hospital mortality remained 
uncertain.
METHODS: The data for this study was obtained from the Medical Information Mart 
for Intensive Care IV (MIMIC-IV, version 2.1) database. The normalized lactate 
load, describing the average intensity of hyperlactatemia, was calculated as the 
area under the curve (AUC) of lactate divided by time. 5882 AMI patients 
enrolled in this study were divided into survivor (n = 5015), and non-survivor 
group (n = 867). The primary endpoint was in-hospital mortality. Receiver 
operating characteristic (ROC) curves were generated to assess the predictive 
efficacy of normalized lactate load for in-hospital mortality, and areas under 
the curves of different parameters were compared using DeLong test. Multivariate 
binary logistic regression analysis was employed to explore the association 
between normalized lactate load and in-hospital mortality. The adjusting 
variables included age, gender, ethnicity, heart rate, systolic blood pressure, 
congestive heart failure, shock, dyslipidemia, cardiac arrest, cerebrovascular 
disease, neutrophil, lymphocyte, creatinine, blood nitrogen urea, clopidogrel, 
beta-blockers, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor (ACEI)/angiotensin 
receptor blocker (ARB), statins, dialysis, extracorporeal membrane oxygenation 
(ECMO), the Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (SOFA) score and Simplified 
Acute Physiology Score II (SAPS II). Restricted cubic spline (RCS) was conducted 
to evaluate nonlinear associations of normalized lactate load with in-hospital 
mortality.
RESULTS: The overall in-hospital mortality rate was 14.7%. After adjusting for 
confounding variables, normalized lactate load was independently associated with 
increased risk of in-hospital mortality (Normalized lactate load≥2.6 vs 
Normalized lactate load<2.6: OR, 95% CI: 1.56, 1.27-1.93). The RCS demonstrated 
a positive linear relationship between normalized lactate load and in-hospital 
mortality (non-linear p = 0.725). ROC curves showed that normalized lactate load 
was better than first lactate, maximum lactate, and mean lactate in predicting 
in-hospital mortality, but lower than SOFA and SAPS II. Among participants with 
at least nine lactate measures, normalized lactate load showed predictive 
performance comparable to SOFA and SAPS II.
CONCLUSION: Normalized lactate load can be used to predict the prognosis of 
in-hospital mortality in AMI patients, and its prediction performance increases 
with the increase of lactate measurement.

BACKGROUND: Frailty is associated with poor prognosis in patients undergoing 
transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR). The red blood cell distribution 
width (RDW)-to-albumin ratio (RAR) reflects key components of frailty. This 
study aimed to evaluate the relationship between RAR and all-cause mortality in 
patients undergoing TAVR.
METHODS: The data were extracted from the Medical Information Mart for Intensive 
Care IV database. The RAR was computed by dividing the RDW by the albumin. The 
primary outcome was all-cause mortality within 1-year following TAVR. The 
association between RAR and the primary outcome was evaluated using the 
Kaplan-Meier survival curves, restricted cubic spline (RCS), and Cox 
proportional hazard regression models.
RESULTS: A total of 760 patients (52.9% male) with a median age of 84.0 years 
were assessed. The Kaplan-Meier survival curves showed that patients with higher 
RAR had higher mortality (log-rank P < 0.001). After adjustment for potential 
confounders, we found that a 1 unit increase in RAR was associated with a 46% 
increase in 1-year mortality (HR = 1.46, 95% CI:1.22-1.75, P < 0.001). According 
to the RAR tertiles, high RAR (RAR > 4.0) compared with the low RAR group (RAR < 
3.5) significantly increased the risk of 1-year mortality (HR = 2.21, 95% CI: 
1.23-3.95, P = 0.008). The RCS regression model revealed a continuous linear 
relationship between RAR and all-cause mortality. No significant interaction was 
observed in the subgroup analysis.
CONCLUSION: The RAR is independently associated with all-cause mortality in 
patients treated with TAVR. The higher the RAR, the higher the mortality. This 
simple indicator may be helpful for risk stratification of TAVR patients.

OBJECTIVES: Stroke is the second leading cause of death and the third leading 
cause of disability globally, so monitoring inflammation and nutritional levels 
is essential for the secondary prevention. The impact of the Prognostic 
Nutritional Index (PNI) on tumor and perioperative outcomes has been 
demonstrated as an optimal combination of immune and nutritional indicators. 
However, the role of PNI on hospitalized outcomes in stroke patients remains 
unknown. This study aimed to investigate the clinical predictive value of PNI on 
hospitalized outcomes in stroke patients.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: In this study, stroke cases in the Medical Information 
Mart for Intensive Care IV database were analyzed using two-sample comparisons, 
proportional hazards model, subgroup analyses, and ROC analyses, and a nomogram 
was constructed.
RESULTS: 1795 stroke cases were included in this study, including 1537 in the 
survival group and 258 in the death group. The results showed that PNI was 
higher in the survival group than in the death group (43.98±0.21 vs. 36.09±0.49, 
P=0.001). The optimal regression equation obtained after screening variables 
using COX stepwise regression included age, GCS score, hypertension, PNI, 
leukocytes, and PT (C-index=0.730). The optimal regression equation showed that 
each increase in the PNI value was associated with a 6.6 % reduction in patient 
mortality, holding all other factors constant (HR 0.934, 95 %CI 0.914-0.954, 
P<0.008). Subgroup analyses showed that the Optimum regression equation was more 
effective in predicting hospitalized mortality in Hemorrhagic Stroke than in 
Ischemic Stroke (C-index: 0.803 vs. 0.703). ROC analysis revealed that the 
cut-off value of PNI for predicting hospital mortality in stroke patients was 
37.45. The Kaplan-Meier curves clearly show that patients with PNI>37.45 have a 
higher survival rate than the low PNI group.
CONCLUSIONS: Higher PNI is associated with better hospitalization outcomes for 
stroke patients. PNI can be used as a supplement to existing indicators, which 
helps predict the survival of stroke inpatients and provides reference value for 
clinical treatment.

Serum chloride level has clinical significance in the prognosis of heart 
failure. Little is known regarding the association between serum chloride levels 
and in-hospital mortality in patients with heart failure.This retrospective 
study used clinical data obtained from the Medical Information Mart for 
Intensive Care Database. The study cohort comprised patients who were 
categorized on the basis of their serum chloride levels, and the primary 
endpoint was in-hospital mortality. To assess the impact of serum chloride 
levels at the time of intensive care unit admission on in-hospital mortality, we 
used various statistical approaches, including multivariable logistic regression 
models, a generalized additive model, and a two-piecewise linear regression 
model. In addition, subgroup analysis was conducted to examine the robustness of 
the main findings.This study comprised 15,983 participants. When compared with 
the reference group (Q5), the groups with the highest (Q7) and lowest (Q1) blood 
chloride levels exhibited increased in-hospital mortality, with fully adjusted 
odds ratios (ORs) of 1.36 [95% confidence interval (CI): 1.08-1.71] and 1.25 
(95% CI: 1-1.56), respectively. A U-shaped relationship was observed between 
blood chloride levels and in-hospital mortality, with the lowest risk observed 
at a threshold of 105.017 mmol/L. The effect sizes and corresponding CIs below 
and above the threshold were 0.969 (95% CI: 0.957-0.982) and 1.039 (95% CI: 
1.002-1.076), respectively. Stratified analyses demonstrated the robustness of 
this correlation.The relationship between serum chloride levels and in-hospital 
mortality in patients with heart failure was U-shaped, with an inﬂection point 
of 105.017 mmol/L.

PURPOSE: Sepsis is a significant threat in the intensive care unit (ICU) 
worldwide because it has high morbidity and mortality rates. Early recognition 
and diagnosis of sepsis are essential for the prevention of adverse outcomes. 
The present study aimed to quantitatively assess the association between serum 
anion gap (AG) levels and 30- and 90-day all-cause mortality among sepsis 
patients.
METHODS: Clinical data of patients diagnosed with sepsis were extracted from the 
Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care III (MIMIC III) database. 
Kaplan-Meier curves and Cox proportional hazards models were used to evaluate 
the association between serum AG levels and all-cause mortality. A receiver 
operating characteristic (ROC) curve was drawn to quantify the efficacy of using 
the serum AG level to predict all-cause mortality.
RESULTS: A total of 3811 patients were included in the study. The Kaplan-Meier 
curves showed that patients with higher serum AG levels had a shorter survival 
time than those with lower levels. Serum AG levels were found to be highly 
effective in predicting all-cause mortality secondary to sepsis (30-day: 
AUROC = 0.703; 90-day: AUROC = 0.696). The Cox regression model further 
indicated that the serum AG level was an independent risk factor for 30- and 
90-day mortality in sepsis (HR 3.44, 95% CI 2.97-3.99 for 30-day; HR 3.17, 95% 
CI 2.76-3.65 for 90-day, P < 0.001 for both).
CONCLUSIONS: High serum AG may be considered as an alternative parameter for 
predicting the death risk in sepsis when other variables are not immediately 
available. Prospective large-scale studies are needed to support its predictive 
value in the clinic.

OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to investigate the potential correlation between the 
neutrophil percentage to serum albumin ratio(NPAR) and in-hospital mortality in 
critically ill patients with Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD).
PATIENTS AND METHODS: This study employed a retrospective cohort design. A total 
of 599 COPD patients were included in this research. Clinical data from the 
MIMIC-IV (Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care IV) database were 
utilized. To determine whether a correlation exists between NPAR and in-hospital 
mortality, a multivariable logistic regression analysis was conducted. Subgroup 
analyses were performed, taking into account factors such as age, sex, diabetes, 
congestive heart failure, and ventilator use.
RESULTS: Among the 599 patients studied, 114 (19.0%) experienced in-hospital 
mortality. In the multivariable logistic regression model, NPAR was positively 
correlated with in-hospital mortality; for each unit increase in NPAR, the 
in-hospital mortality rate increased by 5% (Odds Ratio [OR] = 1.05; 95% 
Confidence Interval [95% CI] = 1.02-1.09). Compared to the lowest NPAR group, 
the highest NPAR group had a significantly greater risk of in-hospital mortality 
(OR [95% CI] = 2.15 [1.11-4.17]). Furthermore, the results of the subgroup 
analyses were consistent across all groups.
CONCLUSION: Our study reveals a correlation between NPAR levels and mortality in 
COPD patients. Further research is warranted to validate these findings.

BACKGROUND: There has been a growing body of research focusing on patients with 
Congestive Heart Failure (CHF) and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) 
admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU). However, the optimal blood pressure 
(BP) level for such patients remains insufficiently explored. This study aimed 
to investigate the associations between systolic blood pressure (SBP) and 
in-hospital mortality among ICU patients with both CHF and COPD.
METHODS: This retrospective cohort study enrolled 6309 patients from the Medical 
Information Mart for Intensive Care IV (MIMIC-IV) database. SBP was examined as 
both a continuous and categorical variable, with the primary outcome being 
in-hospital mortality. The investigation involved multivariable logistic 
regression, restricted cubic spline regression, and subgroup analysis to 
determine the relationship between SBP and mortality.
RESULTS: The cohort consisted of 6309 patients with concurrent CHF and COPD 
(3246 females and 3063 males), with an average age of 73.0 ± 12.5 years. The 
multivariate analysis revealed an inverse association between SBP and 
in-hospital mortality, both as a continuous variable (odds ratio = 0.99 [95% CI, 
0.99~1]) and as a categorical variable (divided into quintiles). Restricted 
cubic spline analysis demonstrated an L-shaped relationship between SBP and 
mortality risk (P nonlinearity < 0.001), with an inflection point at 99.479 
mmHg. Stratified analyses further supported the robustness of this correlation.
CONCLUSION: The relationship between SBP and in-hospital mortality in patients 
with both CHF and COPD follows an L-shaped pattern, with an inflection point at 
approximately 99.479 mmHg.

Aims/Background The role of heparin in sepsis therapy has been widely debated. 
The controversy surrounding heparin's use as an anticoagulant in sepsis may stem 
from differences in sepsis definitions, study designs, timing and dosage of drug 
administration, treatment duration, complications, and patient severity. In this 
study, we aimed to determine the optimal timing and dosage of heparin in 
patients with sepsis, identify specific subgroups that could benefit from 
heparin therapy, and explore laboratory markers to assess its efficacy. Methods 
This retrospective cohort study was conducted using the Medical Information Mart 
for Intensive Care-IV dataset. Data from patients with sepsis were extracted 
based on the Sepsis 3.0 criteria. Patients were categorized according to heparin 
use. The effectiveness of early and appropriate heparin administration was 
assessed, and a subgroup analysis was performed to identify patients most likely 
to benefit from heparin therapy. Additionally, factors mediating the improvement 
in sepsis prognosis following heparin treatment were analyzed. Results We 
recruited 4149 participants who met the inclusion criteria, with an overall 
28-day mortality rate of 19.5%. There were 2192 individuals in the heparin group 
and 1957 in the non-heparin group. After propensity score matching, heparin 
therapy demonstrated a significantly greater effect on reducing both 28-day and 
90-day mortality compared to the non-heparin treatment (18.1% vs. 10.7%, p < 
0.001; 18.8% vs. 12.6%, p < 0.001). However, the heparin group had a higher 
incidence of major bleeding (10.9% vs. 6.3%, p = 0.001), increased use of 
mechanical ventilation (54.3% vs. 45.1%, p < 0.001), and a longer intensive care 
unit stay (3.6 vs. 2.5 days, p < 0.001) compared to the non-heparin group. Early 
administration of high-dose heparin improved 28-day survival. Early and adequate 
heparin administration was more effective than late and insufficient dosing (p < 
0.01), except in patients with sepsis who had low white blood cell counts, 
alkalosis, or reduced platelet counts. The increase in platelet count had a 
significant mediating effect on the entire cohort (p < 0.001 for the causal 
mediation effect), with a mediation proportion of 14%. Conclusion Early and 
adequate heparin administration can significantly improve the prognosis of 
sepsis. An increase in platelet count may serve as a potential indicator of the 
effectiveness of heparin therapy in sepsis.

BACKGROUND: Elevated red cell distribution width (RDW) has been reported to be 
associated with mortality in some critically ill patient populations. The aim of 
this article is to investigate the relationship between RDW and in-hospital 
mortality and short- and long-term mortality of patients with cholecystitis.
METHOD: We conducted a retrospective cohort study in which data from all 702 
patients extracted from the Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care III 
(MIMIC-III) database were used. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves 
were constructed to evaluate the prognostic predictive value of RDW for 
in-hospital mortality and short- (i.e., 30-day and 90-day) and long-term (i.e., 
180-day, 1-year, 3-year, and 5-year) mortality. We converted RDW into a 
categorical variable according to quintiles as less than or equal to 13.9%, 
14.0-14.8%, 14.9-15.8%, and 15.9-17.2% and more than 17.2%. The Kaplan-Meier 
(K-M) methods and log-rank tests were used to compare survival differences among 
different groups. The relationships between RDW levels and in-hospital mortality 
were evaluated by univariate and multivariate binary logistic regression models. 
Multivariable Cox regression models were built to investigate the association of 
RDW on the short-term and long-term mortality.
RESULT: After adjusting for potential confounders, RDW was positively associated 
with in-hospital mortality (OR: 1.187, 95% CI [1.049, 1.343]) and short- (i.e., 
30-day: HR: 1.183, 95% CI [1.080, 1.295], 90-day: HR: 1.175, 95% CI [1.089, 
1.268]) and long-term (i.e., 1-year: HR:1.162, 95% CI [1.089, 1.240]) mortality 
in critically ill patients with cholecystitis. Similar results were also shown 
in the secondary outcomes of 180-day, 3-year, and 5-year mortality. RDW had a 
significant accurate prognostic effect on different endpoints and could improve 
the prognostic effect of scoring systems.
CONCLUSION: High level of RDW is associated with an increased risk of 
in-hospital mortality and short- and long-term mortality in critically ill 
patients with cholecystitis. RDW can independently predict the prognosis of 
patients with cholecystitis.

PURPOSE: Investigating the association between red cell distribution width (RDW) 
and all-cause mortality in patients with breast cancer, to evaluate the 
potential clinical prognostic value of RDW.
METHODS: Based on the RDW index, patients with breast cancer in the Medical 
Information Mart for Intensive Care (MIMIC-IV) database were categorized into 
quartiles. The primary outcomes included in-hospital mortality from all causes 
during the first six months, the first year, and the first three years. Cox 
hazards regression and restricted cubic spline (RCS) models were developed to 
investigate the effects of RDW on primary outcomes.
RESULTS: The study included 939 patients (female). The 6-month, 1-year, and 
3-year mortality rates were 14.0%, 21.4%, and 28.4%, respectively. Multivariate 
Cox proportional hazards analyses demonstrated that RDW exhibited an autonomous 
association with an increased risk of all-cause mortality. After adjusting for 
confounders, higher RDW quartiles were significantly associated with 6-month 
mortality (adjusted hazard ratio (HR), 3.197; 95% confidence interval (CI), 
1.745-5.762; P < 0.001), 1-year mortality (adjusted HR, 2.978; 95% CI, 
1.867-4.748; P < 0.001), and 3-year mortality (adjusted HR, 2.526; 95% CI, 
1.701-3.750; P < 0.001). The RCS curves demonstrated that high RDW (> 14.6) was 
associated with a greater risk of all-cause mortality. Subgroup analyses 
revealed no statistically significant differences in the interactions between 
the subgroups.
CONCLUSION: The study revealed a highly pronounced relationship between RDW and 
overall mortality, indicating its potential as an autonomous prognostic factor 
for increased mortality among patients with breast cancer.

BACKGROUND/AIM: We aimed to construct a validated nomogram model for predicting 
short-term (28-day) ischemic stroke mortality among critically ill populations.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: We collected raw data from the Medical Information Mart 
for Intensive Care IV database, a comprehensive repository renowned for its 
depth and breadth in critical care information. Subsequently, a rigorous 
analytical framework was employed, incorporating a 10-fold cross-validation 
procedure to ensure robustness and reliability. Leveraging advanced statistical 
methodologies, specifically the least absolute shrinkage and selection operator 
regression, variables pertinent to 28-day mortality in ischemic stroke were 
meticulously screened. Next, binary logistic regression was utilized to 
establish nomogram, then applied concordance index to evaluate discrimination of 
the prediction models. Predictive performance of the nomogram was assessed by 
integrated discrimination improvement (IDI) and net reclassification index 
(NRI). Additionally, we generated calibration curves to assess calibrating 
ability. Finally, we evaluated the nomogram's net clinical benefit using 
decision curve analysis (DCA), in comparison with scoring systems clinically 
applied under common conditions.
RESULTS: A total of 2089 individuals were identified and assigned into training 
(n = 1443) or validation (n = 646) cohorts. Various identified risk factors, 
including age, ethnicity, marital status, underlying metastatic solid tumor, 
Charlson comorbidity index, heart rate, Glasgow coma scale, glucose 
concentrations, white blood cells, sodium concentrations, potassium 
concentrations, mechanical ventilation, use of heparin and mannitol, were 
associated with short-term (28-day) mortality in ischemic stroke individuals. A 
concordance index of 0.834 was obtained in the training dataset, indicating that 
our nomogram had good discriminating ability. Results of IDI and NRI in both 
cohorts proved that our nomogram had positive improvement of predictive 
performance, compared to other scoring systems. The actual and predicted 
incidence of mortality showed favorable concordance on calibration curves (P > 
0.05). DCA curves revealed that, compared with scoring systems clinically used 
under common conditions, the constructed nomogram yielded a greater net clinical 
benefit.
CONCLUSIONS: Utilizing a comprehensive array of fourteen readily accessible 
variables, a prognostic nomogram was meticulously formulated and rigorously 
validated to provide precise prognostication of short-term mortality within the 
ischemic stroke cohort.

Pulmonary embolism (PE) is a common and potentially lethal form of venous 
thromboembolic disease in ICU patients. A limited number of risk factors have 
been associated with PE in ICU patients. In this study, we aimed to screen the 
independent risk factors of PE in ICU patients that can be used to evaluate the 
patient's condition and provide targeted treatment. We performed a retrospective 
cohort study using a freely accessible critical care database Medical 
Information Mart for Intensive Care (MIMIC)-III. The ICU patients were divided 
into two groups based on the incidence of PE. Finally, 9871 ICU patients were 
included, among which 204 patients (2.1%) had pulmonary embolism. During the 
multivariate logistic regression analysis, sepsis, hospital_LOS (the length of 
stay in hospital), type of admission, tumor, APTT (activated partial 
thromboplastin time) and platelet were independent risk factors for patients for 
PE in ICU, with OR values of 1.471 (95%CI 1.001-2.162), 1.001 (95%CI 
1.001-1.001), 3.745 (95%CI 2.187-6.414), 1.709 (95%CI 1.247-2.341), 1.014 (95%CI 
1.010-1.017) and 1.002 (95%CI 1.001-1.003) (Ps < 0.05). ROC curve analysis 
showed that the composite indicator had a higher predictive value for ICU 
patients with PE, with a ROC area under the curve (AUC) of 0.743 (95%CI 0.710 
-0.776, p < 0.001). Finally, sepsis, tumor, platelet count, length of stay in 
the hospital, emergency admission and APTT were independent predictors of PE in 
ICU patients.

The effect of serum glucose-to-potassium ratio (GPR) on cerebrovascular diseases 
has been previously validated. However, the value of the GPR in patients with 
severe intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH) requiring ICU admission remains unclear. 
This study aimed to investigate the association between the GPR and the clinical 
prognosis of critically ill patients with ICH. This study identified patients 
with severe ICH requiring ICU admission from the Medical Information Mart for 
Intensive Care (MIMIC-IV) database and divided them into quartiles based on GPR 
levels. Outcomes included 30-day, 90-day, and 1-year mortality rates. The 
association between the GPR and clinical outcomes in critically ill patients 
with ICH was elucidated using Cox proportional hazards regression analysis and 
restricted cubic splines. In total, 2018 patients (53.8% male), with a median 
age of 70 years, were enrolled in the study. The 30-day, 90-day, and 1-year 
mortality rates were 23.9%, 30.1%, and 38.4%, respectively. Per multivariate Cox 
proportional hazards analysis, an elevated GPR was significantly associated with 
all-cause mortality. After adjusting for age, sex, Charlson Comorbidity Index, 
white blood cell count, red blood cell count, platelet count, and Glasgow Coma 
Scale, patients with an elevated GPR had a higher 30-day mortality (hazard ratio 
[HR]: 1.32; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.22-1.42; P < 0.001), 90-day 
mortality (HR: 1.27; 95% CI: 1.18-1.37; P < 0.001) and 1-year mortality (HR: 
1.22; 95% CI: 1.14-1.31; P < 0.001) when analyzed as a continuous variable. 
Furthermore, analysis using restricted cubic splines demonstrated a consistent 
and progressive escalation in the risk of all-cause mortality with an elevated 
GPR. The GPR was significantly associated with short- and long-term all-cause 
mortality in critically ill patients with ICH. This finding demonstrates that 
GPR may be useful in identifying patients with ICH at a high risk of all-cause 
mortality.

The Application of Machine Learning in Predicting Mortality Risk in Patients 
With Severe Femoral Neck Fractures: Prediction Model Development Study.

BACKGROUND: Femoral neck fracture (FNF) accounts for approximately 3.58% of all 
fractures in the entire body, exhibiting an increasing trend each year. 
According to a survey, in 1990, the total number of hip fractures in men and 
women worldwide was approximately 338,000 and 917,000, respectively. In China, 
FNFs account for 48.22% of hip fractures. Currently, many studies have been 
conducted on postdischarge mortality and mortality risk in patients with FNF. 
However, there have been no definitive studies on in-hospital mortality or its 
influencing factors in patients with severe FNF admitted to the intensive care 
unit.
OBJECTIVE: In this paper, 3 machine learning methods were used to construct a 
nosocomial death prediction model for patients admitted to intensive care units 
to assist clinicians in early clinical decision-making.
METHODS: A retrospective analysis was conducted using information of a patient 
with FNF from the Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care III. After 
balancing the data set using the Synthetic Minority Oversampling Technique 
algorithm, patients were randomly separated into a 70% training set and a 30% 
testing set for the development and validation, respectively, of the prediction 
model. Random forest, extreme gradient boosting, and backpropagation neural 
network prediction models were constructed with nosocomial death as the outcome. 
Model performance was assessed using the area under the receiver operating 
characteristic curve, accuracy, precision, sensitivity, and specificity. The 
predictive value of the models was verified in comparison to the traditional 
logistic model.
RESULTS: A total of 366 patients with FNFs were selected, including 48 cases 
(13.1%) of in-hospital death. Data from 636 patients were obtained by balancing 
the data set with the in-hospital death group to survival group as 1:1. The 3 
machine learning models exhibited high predictive accuracy, and the area under 
the receiver operating characteristic curve of the random forest, extreme 
gradient boosting, and backpropagation neural network were 0.98, 0.97, and 0.95, 
respectively, all with higher predictive performance than the traditional 
logistic regression model. Ranking the importance of the feature variables, the 
top 10 feature variables that were meaningful for predicting the risk of 
in-hospital death of patients were the Simplified Acute Physiology Score II, 
lactate, creatinine, gender, vitamin D, calcium, creatine kinase, creatine 
kinase isoenzyme, white blood cell, and age.
CONCLUSIONS: Death risk assessment models constructed using machine learning 
have positive significance for predicting the in-hospital mortality of patients 
with severe disease and provide a valid basis for reducing in-hospital mortality 
and improving patient prognosis.

PURPOSE: Measurement of central venous pressure (CVP) can be a useful clinical 
tool. However, the formal utility of CVP measurement in preventing mortality in 
septic patients has never been proven.
METHODS: The Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care III (MIMIC-III) 
database was searched to identify septic patients with and without CVP 
measurements. The primary outcome was 28-day mortality. Multivariate regression 
was used to elucidate the relationship between CVP measurement and 28-day 
mortality, and propensity score matching (PSM) and an inverse probability of 
treatment weighing (IPTW) were employed to validate our findings.
RESULTS: A total of 10,275 patients were included in our study, of which 4516 
patients (44%) underwent CVP measurement within 24 h of intensive care unit 
(ICU) admission. The risk of 28-day mortality was reduced in the CVP group (OR 
0.60 (95% CI 0.51-0.70; p < 0.001)). Patients in the CVP group received more 
fluid on day 1 and had a shorter duration of mechanical ventilation and 
vasopressor use, and the reduction in serum lactate was greater than that in the 
no CVP group. The mediating effect of serum lactate reduction was significant 
for the whole cohort (p = 0.04 for the average causal mediation effect (ACME)) 
and patients in the CVP group with an initial CVP level below 8 mmHg (p = 0.04 
for the ACME).
CONCLUSION: CVP measurement was associated with decreased risk-adjusted 28-day 
mortality among patients with sepsis and was proportionally mediated through 
serum lactate reduction.

OBJECTIVES: This study aimed to explore the relationship between red blood cell 
distribution width (RDW) and all-cause mortality in critically ill patients 
undergoing intra-aortic balloon pumping (IABP) in the intensive care unit (ICU).
METHODS: This study retrospectively analyzed data from the Medical Information 
Mart for Intensive Care IV (MIMIC-IV) database. The primary endpoint was the 
30-day mortality rate, while the secondary endpoint was the in-hospital 
mortality rate. Restricted cubic splines were used to assess the dose-response 
relationship. The receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve and Kaplan-Meier 
curve analysis were carried out to evaluate the predictive performance of RDW. 
Moreover, multiple logistic regression analyses and subgroup analyses were 
conducted to investigate the relationship between RDW and 30-day mortality. 
Finally, propensity score matching (PSM) was performed to adjust for the 
imbalance of covariates.
RESULTS: In total, 732 patients were finally identified from the MIMIC-IV 
database in this study. The RDW of patients in the non-survivor group was 
significantly higher compared with those in the survivor group (P < 0.01). 
Multiple logistic regression analyses corroborated RDW was an independent 
predictor of all-cause 30-day mortality in critically ill patients post-IABP. 
Meanwhile, ROC analysis identified an RDW cutoff of 14.2%. High RDW patients 
exhibited a 131% (OR = 2.31, 95% CI: 1.49-3.61) elevated risk of 30-day 
mortality after adjusting for confounders in multivariable logistic regression. 
After PSM, 412 patients were included in the matched cohort. In the original and 
matched cohorts, the high RDW group had higher 30-day and in-hospital mortality 
rates, as well as longer ICU stays. Lastly, the area under the ROC curve for 
30-day mortality was 0.686, with an optimal cutoff point of 14.2 for RDW 
(sensitivity: 69.09 % and specificity: 63.32%).
CONCLUSION: RDW could be a simple and valuable prognostic tool to predict 
mortality in critically ill patients after IABP.

OBJECTIVE: To investigate the prescription rate of short-term systemic use of 
glucocorticoids during hospitalization in patients with cardiogenic shock (CS), 
and outcomes related with glucocorticoid use.
METHODS: We extracted patients' information from the Medical Information Mart 
for Intensive Care IV version 2.0 (MIMIC-IV v2.0) database. The primary endpoint 
was 90-day all-cause mortality. Secondary safety endpoints were infection 
identified by bacterial culture and at least one episode of hyperglycemia after 
ICU admission. Propensity score matching (PSM) was used to balance baseline 
characteristics. The difference in cumulative mortality rate between these 
treated with and without glucocorticoids was assessed by Kaplan-Meier curve with 
log-rank test. Independent risk factors for endpoints were identified by Cox or 
Logistic regression analysis.
RESULTS: A total of 1528 patients were enrolled, and one-sixth of these patients 
received short-term systemic therapy of glucocorticoids during hospitalization. 
These conditions, including rapid heart rate, the presence of rheumatic disease, 
chronic pulmonary disease and septic shock, high lactate level, the requirements 
of mechanical ventilation and continuous renal replacement therapy, were 
associated with an increase in glucocorticoid administration (all P ≤ 0.024). 
During a follow-up of 90 days, the cumulative mortality rate in patients treated 
with glucocorticoids was significantly higher than that in these untreated with 
glucocorticoids (log-rank test, P < 0.001). Multivariable Cox regression 
analysis showed that glucocorticoid use (hazard ratio 1.48, 95% confidence 
interval [CI] 1.22-1.81; P < 0.001) was independently associated with an 
increased risk for 90-day all-cause mortality. This result was consistent 
irrespective of age, gender, the presence of myocardial infarction, acute 
decompensated heart failure and septic shock, and inotrope therapy, but was more 
evident in low-risk patients as assessed by ICU scoring systems. Additionally, 
multivariable Logistic regression analysis showed that glucocorticoid exposure 
was an independent predictor of hyperglycemia (odds ratio 2.14, 95% CI 
1.48-3.10; P < 0.001), but not infection (odds ratio 1.23, 95% CI 0.88-1.73; 
P = 0.221). After PSM, glucocorticoid therapy was also significantly related 
with increased risks of 90-day mortality and hyperglycemia.
CONCLUSIONS: Real-world data showed that short-term systemic use of 
glucocorticoids was common in CS patients. Importantly, these prescriptions were 
associated with increased risks of adverse events.

OBJECTIVE: Previous studies have shown inconsistent results in relation to the 
red cell distribution width (RDW), neutrophil to lymphocyte ratio (NLR), and 
platelet to lymphocyte ratio (PLR) of atrial fibrillation (AF). This 
retrospective study is aimed at detecting the association of RDW, NLR, and PLR 
with AF.
METHODS: A total of 4717 critical care patients were screened from the Medical 
Information Mart for Intensive Care- (MIMIC-) III database. The patients were 
separated into the non-AF and AF groups. The imbalances between the groups were 
reduced using propensity score matching (PSM). ROC curves were generated to 
detect the diagnostic value of RDW, NLR, and PLR. Logistic regression analysis 
was used to detect the risk factors for AF.
RESULTS: A total of 991 non-AF patients paired with 991 AF patients were 
included after PSM in this study. The RDW level in the AF group was 
significantly higher than that in the non-AF group (15.09 ± 1.93vs. 14.89 ± 
1.91, P = 0.017). Neither NLR nor PLR showed any significant difference between 
the two groups (P > 0.05 for each). According to ROC curve, RDW showed a very 
low diagnostic value of AF (AUC = 0.5341), and the best cutoff of RDW was 14.1 
(ACU = 0.5257, sensitivity = 0.658, specificity = 0.395). Logistic regression 
analysis showed that an elevated RDW level increased 1.308-fold (95%CI = 
1.077-1.588, P = 0.007) risk of AF. Neither elevated NLR nor elevated PLR was a 
significant risk factor for AF (OR = 0.993, 95%CI = 0.802-1.228, P = 0.945 for 
NLR; OR = 0.945, 95%CI = 0.763-1.170, P = 0.603 for PLR).
CONCLUSIONS: Elevated RDW level but not NLR or PLR levels is associated with AF. 
RDW > 14.1 is a risk factor for AF, but its diagnostic capacity for AF is not of 
great value.

BACKGROUND: The prognostic value of red blood cell distribution width (RDW) in 
critical illness remains controversial. The aim of this study was to investigate 
the prognostic value of on-admission RDW for in-hospital and 4-year mortality in 
adults with critical illness.
METHODS: This is a retrospective cohort study from the Medical Information Mart 
for Intensive Care III (MIMIC III) database (version 1.4). Patients admitted to 
the intensive care unit (ICU) for the first time were included. Their 
on-admission RDW and severity scores were extracted with the Structured Query 
Language (SQL). The patients were categorized into a training set and a 
validation set. The relation of RDW to in-hospital and 4-year all-cause 
mortality was analyzed using receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve, 
Kaplan-Meier curve, Cox model, net reclassification index (NRI), integrated 
discriminatory index (IDI) and nomogram.
RESULTS: A total of 36,532 patients (21,090 in training and 15,442 in validation 
set) were included in this study. Increased RDW was significantly associated 
with higher in-hospital and 4-year mortality. The prognostic value of RDW for 
4-year mortality was independent of conventional severity scores. Using 
conventional severity scores as covariates the continuous NRI and IDI of RDW for 
in-hospital mortality were around 0.3-0.5 and 0.01-0.03, respectively. For 
4-year mortality the NRI was around 0.2-0.3 and IDIs was around 0.03-0.08.
CONCLUSIONS: Admission RDW predicts both in-hospital and 4-year mortality in 
adult patients with critical illness admitted in the ICU, and can provide 
additional prognostic values beyond conventional clinical severity scores.

BACKGROUND: Serum phosphate levels have been reported to be linked to the 
prognosis in critically ill patients. The purpose of this study was to analyze 
the impact of the trajectory of changes in serum phosphate levels on the 
short-term mortality risk in patients with sepsis.
METHODS: This retrospective cohort study used data on patients with sepsis from 
the 2008-2019 Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care IV (MIMIC-IV) 
database. Serum phosphate level trajectories were constructed using a latent 
growth mixture modeling (LGMM) based on four measurements of serum phosphate at 
six-hour intervals within 24 h of admission to the intensive care unit (ICU). 
The relationship between serum phosphate levels at ICU admission and serum 
phosphate level trajectories and the risk of 28-day mortality in patients with 
sepsis was analyzed using Cox regression models, and hazard ratio (HR) and 95% 
confidence interval (CI) were calculated.
RESULTS: Of these 1,703 patients with sepsis included, 566 (33.24%) died within 
28 days. The median serum phosphate levels of the patients were 4.10 (3.00, 
5.50) mg/dL. Four serum phosphate level trajectories were classified: 
normal-level-steady trend (trajectory 1), high-level-steady trend (trajectory 
2), high-level-decreasing trend (trajectory 3), and high-level-increasing trend 
(trajectory 4). High serum phosphate levels at admission were associated with a 
higher risk of 28-day mortality (HR = 1.05, 95%CI: 1.01-1.09) in patients with 
sepsis. For trajectories, trajectory 2 (HR = 1.27, 95%CI: 1.05-1.54) related to 
an increased risk of 28-day mortality compared with trajectory 1, whereas 
trajectory 4 (HR = 1.69, 95%CI: 0.99-2.91, P = 0.056) may be related. There was 
no significant difference in 28-day mortality between patients on trajectory 3 
and trajectory 1 (P = 0.280). Subgroup analyses demonstrated that patients with 
trajectory 2 were linked to a higher risk of 28-day mortality in different 
population subgroups (P < 0.05).
CONCLUSION: Stable trajectories of high serum phosphate levels are an important 
risk factor for short-term mortality in patients with sepsis.

OBJECTIVES: Malnutrition is associated with adverse outcomes in acute or chronic 
diseases. However, the prediction value of the Geriatric Nutritional Risk Index 
(GNRI) in critically ill patients with acute kidney injury (AKI) has not been 
well studied.
METHODS: Data was extracted from the Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care 
III (MIMIC-III) and the electronic intensive care unit database. We used two 
nutritional indicators, the GNRI and the modified Nutrition Risk in Critically 
ill (NUTRIC) score, to evaluate the relationship between the nutritional status 
of patients with AKI and prognosis. The outcome is in-hospital mortality and 
90-day mortality. The prediction accuracy of GNRI was compared with the NUTRIC 
score.
RESULTS: A total of 4,575 participants with AKI were enrolled in this study. The 
median age of 68 (interquartile range, 56-79) years, and 1,142 (25.0%) patients 
experienced in-hospital mortality, and 1,238 (27.1%) patients experienced 90-day 
mortality. Kaplan-Meier survival analysis indicated that lower GNRI levels and 
high NUTRIC score are associated with lower in-hospital and 90-day survival of 
patients with AKI (P < .001 by log-rank test). After multivariate adjustment, 
Cox regression analysis demonstrated a 2-fold increased risk of in-hospital 
(hazard ratio = 2.019, 95% confidence interval: 1.699-2.400, P < .001) and 
90-day (hazard ratio = 2.023, 95% confidence interval: 1.715-2.387, P < .001) 
mortality in the low GNRI group. Moreover, the multivariate-adjusted Cox model 
containing GNRI had higher prediction accuracy for the prognosis of patients 
with AKI than that with NUTRIC score (AUCGNRI model vs. AUCNUTRIC model for 
in-hospital mortality = 0.738 vs. 0.726, AUCGNRI model vs. AUCNUTRIC model for 
90-day mortality = 0.748 vs. 0.726). In addition, the prediction value of GNRI 
was validated by the electronic intensive care unit database (7,881 patients 
with AKI) with satisfying performance (AUCGNRI model = 0.680).
CONCLUSIONS: Our results demonstrated that GNRI is strongly associated with 
survival in patients in the intensive care unit coexisting with AKI, and the 
GNRI has a superior predictive value than the NUTRIC score.

BACKGROUND: Patients admitted to the surgical intensive care unit (SICU) often 
suffer from multi-organ dysfunction and have a high mortality rate. Therefore, 
finding a simple but effective clinical indicator to predict the prognosis of 
patients is essential to improve their survival. The aim of this study was to 
investigate the relationship between blood urea nitrogen to serum albumin ratio 
(B/A) and short-term mortality among patients from the SICU.
METHODS: All eligible adult patients admitted to the SICU from the Medical 
Information Mart for Intensive Care IV (MIMIC-IV) database were recruited for 
this study. Participants were divided into a death group (n = 638) and a 
survival group (n = 2,048) based on the 90-day prognosis, and then grouped by 
B/A quartiles. We used restricted cubic splines (RCS) to visually analyze the 
correlation of B/A with 30- and 90-day risk of death. Cumulative survival rates 
were estimated using Kaplan-Meier survival curves according to B/A quartiles and 
evaluated using the log-rank test. Cox proportional risk models were developed 
and sensitivity analyses were performed to explore whether B/A was independently 
associated with short-term outcomes in SICU patients. Receiver operating 
characteristic (ROC) curves were analyzed to ascertain the value of B/A for 
prognosticating 90-day outcome.
RESULTS: A total of 2686 participants were included in the final study, and 
their 30-day and 90-day all-cause mortality rates were 17.61% and 23.75%, 
respectively. The differences in 30-day and 90-day mortality rates were 
statistically significant among the four groups of patients (all p < 0.001). RCS 
curves showed that B/A was linearly associated with the risk of 30-day and 
90-day all-cause mortality in SICU patients (χ2 = 0.960, p = 0.811; χ2 = 1.940, 
p = 0.584). Kaplan-Meier analysis showed that the 90-day cumulative survival 
rate gradually decreased as B/A increased, with patients in the highest quartile 
of B/A having the lowest survival rate (p < 0.001). Cox regression indicated 
that elevated B/A (> 9.69) was an independent risk factor for 30-day and 90-day 
all-cause mortality in SICU patients. The analysis of ROC curves demonstrated 
that B/A exhibited a significant predictive ability for 90-day mortality, with 
an optimal threshold of 6.587, a sensitivity of 56.9%, and a specificity of 
64.8%.
CONCLUSIONS: Elevated B/A (> 9.69) on admission was an independent risk factor 
for short-term mortality in SICU patients, and clinicians should pay more 
attention to this group of patients and intervene clinically at an early stage 
to reduce mortality.

INTRODUCTION: Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) is a hospital-acquired 
infection with high mortality, and remains a challenge for clinical treatment. 
Red blood cell distribution width (RDW) was associated with worse outcomes in 
several diseases. The purpose of this study was to investigate the relationship 
between mean RDW values, changes in RDW (delta RDW), and in-hospital mortality 
among patients with VAP.
METHODS: In the present study, we enrolled 1266 VAP patients from the Medical 
Information Mart for Intensive Care IV (MIMIC-IV) database. All patients were 
categorized into low group, medium group, and high group according to tertiles 
of mean RDW values. The primary outcome was all-cause in-hospital mortality. 
Univariate logistic regression analysis, multivariate logistic regression 
analysis, and restricted cubic spline (RCS) curve were performed to determine 
the association between mean RDW values and in-hospital mortality in VAP. 
Moreover, RCS curve was plotted to explore the dose-response relationship 
between delta RDW and in-hospital mortality in VAP.
RESULTS: Among the VAP patients included in the study, the in-hospital mortality 
was 20.85% with 264 non-survivors and 1002 survivors. The non-survivors 
exhibited significantly higher mean RDW values and delta RDW values compared to 
survivors. Multivariate logistic regression analysis indicated that mean RDW 
values were positively associated with in-hospital mortality in VAP after 
adjusting for relevant covariates. The RCS curve demonstrated a dose-response 
relationship between mean RDW and the mortality in VAP. Moreover, a linear 
relationship was observed between delta RDW and in-hospital mortality in VAP.
CONCLUSION: Higher mean RDW values were significantly associated with an 
increased risk of in-hospital mortality in VAP. Additionally, a linear 
relationship was found between delta RDW values and in-hospital mortality. These 
findings suggest that RDW can be used to identify high-risk patients with poorer 
outcomes in VAP.

BACKGROUND: To investigate the association between serum osmolality and 
deteriorating renal function in patients with acute myocardial infarction (AMI).
METHODS: Three thousand eight hundred eighty-five AMI patients from the Medical 
Information Mart for Intensive Care IV were enrolled for this study. The primary 
outcome was deteriorating renal function. Secondary outcomes included the 
new-onset of acute kidney injury (AKI) and progress of AKI. < 293.2725 mmol/L 
was defined as low serum osmolality, and ≥ 293.2725 mmol/L as high serum 
osmolality based on upper quartile. Univariate and multivariate logistic 
regression models were used to explore the associations between serum osmolality 
and the development of deteriorating renal function, the new-onset of AKI and 
progress of AKI among AMI patients. Subgroup analysis was also conducted.
RESULTS: One thousand three hundred ninety-three AMI patients developed 
deteriorating renal function. After adjusting all confounding factors, high 
serum osmolality was associated with increased risk of deteriorating renal 
function [odds ratio (OR) = 1.47, 95% confidence interval (CI): 1.22-1.78], 
new-onset of AKI (OR = 1.31, 95% CI: 1.01-1.69), and progress of AKI risk 
(OR = 1.26, 95% CI: 1.01-1.59) among AMI patients. In addition, when the 
stratified analysis was performed for age, AMI type, cardiogenic shock, and 
estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR), high serum osmolality was risk 
factor for the risk of deteriorating renal function among patients aged 65 years 
or older, without cardiogenic shock, and with an eGFR ≥ 60 mL/min/1.73m2.
CONCLUSION: Higher serum osmolality increased the risk of deteriorating renal 
function among AMI patients.

BACKGROUND: Glucose metabolism and systemic inflammation have been associated 
with prognosis in acute pancreatitis (AP) patients. However, the possible value 
as a prognostic marker of the glucose-to-lymphocyte ratio (GLR) has not been 
evaluated in critically ill patients with AP.
METHODS: This study included 1,133 critically ill patients with AP from the 
Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care-IV (MIMIC-IV) database, who were 
randomly divided into the training cohort (n=806) and the validation cohort 
(n=327) at a ratio of 7:3. X-tile software was used to determine the optimal 
cut-off values for GLR. Area under the curve (AUC) analysis was performed to 
compare the performance between GLR and other blood-based inflammatory 
biomarkers. Univariate and multivariate Cox regression analyses were applied to 
select prognostic factors associated with in-hospital mortality. A nomogram 
model was developed based on the identified prognostic factors and the 
validation cohort was used to further validate the nomogram.
RESULTS: The optimal cut-off value for GLR was 0.9. The ROC analyses showed that 
the discrimination abilities of GLR were better than other blood-based 
inflammatory biomarkers. Multivariate Cox regression analysis demonstrated that 
age, platelet, albumin, bilirubin, Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (SOFA) 
score, and GLR are independent predictors of poor overall survival in the 
training cohort and were incorporated into the nomogram for in-hospital 
mortality as independent factors. The nomogram exhibited better discrimination 
with C-indexes in the training cohort and the validation cohort of 0.886 (95% 
CI=0.849-0.922) and 0.841 (95% CI=0.767-0.915), respectively. The calibration 
plot revealed an adequate fit of the nomogram for predicting the risk of 
in-hospital mortality in both sets.
CONCLUSION: As an easily available biomarker, GLR can independently predict the 
in-hospital mortality of critically ill patients with AP. The nomogram combining 
GLR with other significant features exerted favorable predictive performance for 
in-hospital mortality.

BACKGROUND: Existing research suggests that using statins may reduce the 
incidence of enteritis caused by C. difficile and improve the prognosis of 
patients. This study aimed to explore the relation between Clostridium 
difficile-induced enteritis (CDE) and statin use.
METHODS: Data were collected from the Medical Information Mart for Intensive 
Care-IV (MIMIC-IV) database. Multivariate logistic regression analysis was 
employed to assess the impact of statin use on CDE incidence in patients in 
intensive care units (ICUs) and its effect on in-hospital mortality among them. 
The research findings were validated by performing propensity score matching 
(PSM), inverse probability of treatment weighting (IPTW), and subgroup analyses.
RESULTS: The study enrolled the data of 51,978 individuals to assess the effect 
of statin usage on the occurrence of CDE in patients admitted to the ICU. The 
results indicate that statins can decrease the prevalence of CDE in patients in 
ICU (odds ratio (OR): 0.758, 95% confidence interval (CI): 0.666-0.873, P < 
0.05), which was further confirmed through PSM (OR: 0.760, 95% CI: 0.661-0.873, 
P < 0.05) and IPTW (OR: 0.818, 95% CI: 0.754-0.888, P < 0.05) analyses. For most 
subgroups, statins' favorable effect in reducing CDE remained constant. A total 
of 1,208 patients were included in the study to evaluate whether statins could 
lower the risk of death in patients in ICU with enteritis caused by C. 
difficile. Statins did not reduce in-hospital mortality of patients in ICU with 
CDE (OR: 0.911, 95% CI: 0.667-1.235, P = 0.553). The results were validated 
following PSM (OR: 0.877, 95% CI: 0.599-1.282, P = 0.499) and IPTW (OR: 0.781, 
95% CI: 0.632-1.062, P = 0.071) analyses, and all subgroups demonstrated 
consistent results.
CONCLUSION: Statin administration can reduce the incidence of CDE in patients in 
the ICU; however, it does not decrease the in-hospital mortality rate for 
individuals with CDE.

BACKGROUND: Intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH) is associated with high mortality and 
morbidity rates. Although some studies have indicated a correlation between 
serum bilirubin levels and ICH severity, evidence of the relationship between 
serum total bilirubin (TBIL) and ICH outcomes remains lacking.
METHODS: A total of 914 patients from the Medical Information Mart for Intensive 
Care IV database met the eligibility criteria and were included in the study. 
The patients were categorized into two groups based on whether they survived for 
28 days following admission to hospital. The association between serum TBIL 
levels and 28-day survival in patients with ICH was investigated using 
Spearman's correlation analysis and restricted cubic splines. The effect of 
serum TBIL levels on survival time and rate in the 28-day period was analyzed 
using Kaplan-Meier curves and restricted mean survival times. Univariate Cox 
regression, least absolute shrinkage and selection operator regression, and 
multivariate Cox regression were used to identify risk factors associated with 
28-day all-cause mortality. Finally, subgroup analysis was performed to verify 
the stability of the association between serum TBIL levels and 28-day all-cause 
mortality in patients with ICH.
RESULTS: A negative relationship was revealed between TBIL levels and survival 
(p < 0.001, correlation = -0.174). Restricted cubic spline analysis revealed a 
nonlinear link between mean serum TBIL levels and 28-day all-cause mortality (p 
for nonlinear = 0.001). Patients with ICH and higher serum TBIL levels had 
significantly reduced survival times and rates compared with those with lower 
serum TBIL levels (p < 0.001). Serum TBIL level was identified as a significant 
risk factor for 28-day all-cause mortality in patients with ICH (hazard ratio 
[95% confidence interval] = 1.121 [1.063-1.182], p < 0.001). Subgroup analyses 
revealed that the assessed variables had no influence on the association between 
serum TBIL levels and 28-day all-cause mortality.
CONCLUSION: Higher serum TBIL levels are associated with a greater risk of 
mortality within 28 days in patients with ICH, whereas lower serum TBIL levels 
are associated with prolonged survival.

BACKGROUND: There are currently no specialized risk-scoring systems for 
critically ill patients with coronary heart disease (CHD). Arterial stiffness, 
as measured by estimated pulse wave velocity (ePWV), has emerged as a potential 
indicator of mortality or adverse cardiovascular events in individuals with CHD. 
This study aimed to evaluate the association between ePWV and all-cause 
mortality among critically ill patients with CHD beyond traditional risk scores.
METHODS: This study included 11 001 participants with CHD from the Medical 
Information Mart for Intensive Care IV, with a one-year follow-up. The primary 
endpoint was one-year all-cause mortality, and the secondary endpoint was 
in-hospital mortality.
RESULTS: Elevated ePWV was significantly associated with higher risks of 
in-hospital (OR 1.15, 95% CI 1.12-1.17, p < 0.001) and one-year (HR 1.21, 95% CI 
1.20-1.23, p < 0.001) mortality. These associations remained consistent when 
adjusted for traditional risk scores and potential confounders. When ePWV was 
integrated into traditional risk scoring models (OASIS, SOFA score, APSIII, SIRS 
score, SAPS II, and LODS score), the predictive accuracy (area under the curve: 
64.55 to 70.56, 64.32 to 72.51, 72.35 to 75.80, 55.58 to 67.68, 71.27 to 73.53, 
67.24 to 73.40, p < 0.001) and reclassification (net reclassification index: 
0.230, 0.268, 0.257, 0.255, 0.221, 0.254; integrated discrimination improvement: 
0.049, 0.072, 0.054, 0.068, 0.037, 0.061, p < 0.001) of these models 
significantly improved for one-year mortality. Similar results were also found 
for in-hospital mortality.
CONCLUSIONS: ePWV is a strong independent predictor of both short- and long-term 
mortality in critically ill patients with CHD. Importantly, integrating ePWV 
into traditional risk scores significantly boosts the predictive accuracy for 
one-year and in-hospital all-cause mortality.

BACKGROUND: It's recognized that stress hyperglycemia ratio (SHR) is considered 
a significant indicator of poor prognosis in many diseases. However, its role in 
critically ill patients with acute heart failure (acute HF) remains 
underexplored.
METHODS: We conducted a retrospective cohort study on patients with acute HF 
included in the Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care IV (MIMIC-IV) 
version 2.2 database. A restricted cubic spline (RCS) regression analysis was 
used to explore the relationship between SHR and the risk of all-cause mortality 
in these patients. Subsequently, a Cox regression model was used to evaluate the 
relationship between SHR and mortality in acute HF patients.
RESULTS: A total of 1,644 acute HF patients were included in the study and 
divided into two groups: the low SHR group (SHR < 1.06, N = 823) and the high 
SHR group (SHR ≥ 1.06, N = 821). In our study, the 30-day, 90-day, 180-day, and 
365-day mortality rates for acute HF were 7.0%, 12%, 15%, and 19%, respectively, 
with higher mortality rates observed in the high SHR group compared to the low 
SHR group. SHR levels showed a linear relationship with all-cause mortality. 
Furthermore, SHR as a continuous variable shows a significant positive 
correlation with 30-day (HR = 2.31, 95% CI: 1.58-3.39), 90-day (HR = 1.81, 95% 
CI: 1.31-2.52), 180-day (HR = 1.57, 95% CI: 1.16-2.12), and 365-day (HR = 1.41, 
95% CI: 1.07-1.85) all-cause mortality. After categorization, high SHR remains 
associated with increased 30-day (HR = 2.4, 95% CI: 1.59-3.61), 90-day 
(HR = 1.76, 95% CI: 1.31-2.36), 180-day (HR = 1.51, 95% CI: 1.16-1.95), and 
365-day (HR = 1.38, 95% CI: 1.09-1.73) all-cause mortality.
CONCLUSION: Our findings indicate that high SHR is an independent predictor of 
poor short- and long-term prognosis in acute HF patients. Understanding the 
impact of SHR on mortality in acute HF is crucial as it can assist clinicians in 
identifying high-risk patients and adjusting treatment strategies accordingly.

BACKGROUND: Acute kidney disease (AKD) affects more than half of critically ill 
elderly patients with acute kidney injury (AKI), which leads to worse short-term 
outcomes.
OBJECTIVE: We aimed to establish 2 machine learning models to predict the risk 
and prognosis of AKD in the elderly and to deploy the models as online apps.
METHODS: Data on elderly patients with AKI (n=3542) and AKD (n=2661) from the 
Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care IV (MIMIC-IV) database were used to 
develop 2 models for predicting the AKD risk and in-hospital mortality, 
respectively. Data collected from Xiangya Hospital of Central South University 
were for external validation. A bootstrap method was used for internal 
validation to obtain relatively stable results. We extracted the indicators 
within 24 hours of the first diagnosis of AKI and the fluctuation range of some 
indicators, namely delta (day 3 after AKI minus day 1), as features. Six machine 
learning algorithms were used for modeling; the area under the receiver 
operating characteristic curve (AUROC), decision curve analysis, and calibration 
curve for evaluating; Shapley additive explanation (SHAP) analysis for visually 
interpreting; and the Heroku platform for deploying the best-performing models 
as web-based apps.
RESULTS: For the model of predicting the risk of AKD in elderly patients with 
AKI during hospitalization, the Light Gradient Boosting Machine (LightGBM) 
showed the best overall performance in the training (AUROC=0.844, 95% CI 
0.831-0.857), internal validation (AUROC=0.853, 95% CI 0.841-0.865), and 
external (AUROC=0.755, 95% CI 0.699-0.811) cohorts. In addition, LightGBM 
performed well for the AKD prognostic prediction in the training (AUROC=0.861, 
95% CI 0.843-0.878), internal validation (AUROC=0.868, 95% CI 0.851-0.885), and 
external (AUROC=0.746, 95% CI 0.673-0.820) cohorts. The models deployed as 
online prediction apps allowed users to predict and provide feedback to submit 
new data for model iteration. In the importance ranking and correlation 
visualization of the model's top 10 influencing factors conducted based on the 
SHAP value, partial dependence plots revealed the optimal cutoff of some 
interventionable indicators. The top 5 factors predicting the risk of AKD were 
creatinine on day 3, sepsis, delta blood urea nitrogen (BUN), diastolic blood 
pressure (DBP), and heart rate, while the top 5 factors determining in-hospital 
mortality were age, BUN on day 1, vasopressor use, BUN on day 3, and partial 
pressure of carbon dioxide (PaCO2).
CONCLUSIONS: We developed and validated 2 online apps for predicting the risk of 
AKD and its prognostic mortality in elderly patients, respectively. The top 10 
factors that influenced the AKD risk and mortality during hospitalization were 
identified and explained visually, which might provide useful applications for 
intelligent management and suggestions for future prospective research.

BACKGROUND: The frailty index based on laboratory tests (FI-lab) can identify 
individuals at increased risk for adverse health outcomes. The association 
between the FI-lab and all-cause mortality in patients with heart failure (HF) 
in the intensive care unit (ICU) remains unknown. This study aimed to determine 
the correlation between FI-lab and all-cause mortality to evaluate the impact of 
FI-lab on the prognosis of critically ill patients with HF.
METHODS: This retrospective observational study utilized data extracted from the 
Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care IV database. The FI-lab, which 
consists of 33 laboratory tests, was constructed. Patients were then grouped 
into quartiles (Q1-Q4) based on their FI-lab scores. Kaplan-Meier analysis was 
used to compare all-cause mortality among the four groups. A Cox proportional 
hazard analysis was conducted to examine the association between the FI-lab 
score and all-cause mortality. The incremental predictive value of adding FI-lab 
to classical disease severity scores was assessed using Harrell's C statistic, 
integrated discrimination improvement (IDI) and net reclassification improvement 
(NRI).
RESULTS: Among 3021 patients, 838 (27.74%) died within 28 days, and 1400 
(46.34%) died within a 360 day follow-up period. Kaplan-Meier analysis indicated 
that patients with higher FI-lab scores had significantly higher risks of 
all-cause mortality (log-rank P < 0.001). Multivariable Cox regression suggested 
that FI-lab, evaluated as a continuous variable (for each 0.01 increase), was 
associated with increased 28 day mortality [hazard ratio (HR) 1.02, 95% 
confidence interval (CI) (1.01-1.03), P < 0.001] and 360 day mortality [HR 1.02, 
95% CI (1.01-1.02), P < 0.001]. When assessed in quartiles, the 28 day mortality 
risk [HR 1.66, 95% CI (1.28-2.15), P < 0.001] and 360 day mortality risk [HR 
1.48, 95% CI (1.23-1.8), P < 0.001] were significantly higher for FI-lab Q4 
compared with FI-lab Q1. FI-lab significantly improved the predictive capability 
of classical disease severity scores for 28 and 360 day mortality.
CONCLUSIONS: In ICU patients diagnosed with HF, the FI-lab is a potent predictor 
of short-term and long-term mortality in critically ill patients with HF. The 
active use of FI-lab to identify high-risk groups among critically ill HF 
patients and initiate timely interventions may have significant value in 
improving the prognosis of critically ill patients with HF.

BACKGROUND: Scalable and accurate health outcome prediction using electronic 
health record (EHR) data has gained much attention in research recently. 
Previous machine learning models mostly ignore relations between different types 
of clinical data (ie, laboratory components, International Classification of 
Diseases codes, and medications).
OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to model such relations and build predictive models 
using the EHR data from intensive care units. We developed innovative neural 
network models and compared them with the widely used logistic regression model 
and other state-of-the-art neural network models to predict the patient's 
mortality using their longitudinal EHR data.
METHODS: We built a set of neural network models that we collectively called as 
long short-term memory (LSTM) outcome prediction using comprehensive feature 
relations or in short, CLOUT. Our CLOUT models use a correlational neural 
network model to identify a latent space representation between different types 
of discrete clinical features during a patient's encounter and integrate the 
latent representation into an LSTM-based predictive model framework. In 
addition, we designed an ablation experiment to identify risk factors from our 
CLOUT models. Using physicians' input as the gold standard, we compared the risk 
factors identified by both CLOUT and logistic regression models.
RESULTS: Experiments on the Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care-III 
dataset (selected patient population: 7537) show that CLOUT (area under the 
receiver operating characteristic curve=0.89) has surpassed logistic regression 
(0.82) and other baseline NN models (<0.86). In addition, physicians' agreement 
with the CLOUT-derived risk factor rankings was statistically significantly 
higher than the agreement with the logistic regression model.
CONCLUSIONS: Our results support the applicability of CLOUT for real-world 
clinical use in identifying patients at high risk of mortality.

BACKGROUND: Studies involving the association of blood albumin with prognosis in 
patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD) during intensive care unit (ICU) were 
scarce.
AIM: We investigated whether reduced blood albumin level independently 
associated with an increased risk of cardiovascular (CV) complications and 
1-year mortality risk in ICU patients with CKD.
METHODS: The Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care III (MIMIC-III) 
database was used. Disease diagnosis and death information among a number of 925 
ICU patients with CKD, who have been measured for blood biochemistry, were 
recorded. Here, multivariable logistic regression Models were structured to 
evaluate the associations between blood albumin levels (first value on 
admission, maximum and minimum value during ICU) and risks for CV complications 
and 1-year mortality among these CKD patients.
RESULTS: In 925 CKD patients, the number of CV complication with heart failure 
(HF), myocardial infarction (MI) or stroke was 470 (50.8%). 406 (43.9%) patients 
were dead during the follow-up of 1 year after patients were discharged. Our 
smooth curve results suggested a curvilinear relation on association between 
blood albumin level and risk of CV complications. The "inflection point" of 
blood albumin level that patients were at highest risk of CV complications was 
3.4 g/dL. The almost linear relationship with a downward trend was observed on 
the association between blood albumin level and 1-year mortality risk. We found 
that reduced blood albumin level contributed to lower risk for CV complications 
and higher risk for 1-year mortality respectively when blood albumin levels in 
CKD patients were below 3.4 g/dL. Additionally, albumin therapy had an obvious 
modifying effect on the independent association, suggesting a possible improved 
effect of albumin therapy on risk of CV complications and 1-year mortality risk 
in these CKD patients.
CONCLUSIONS: Our study reported that reduced blood albumin levels in CKD 
patients during ICU were related to lower risk for CV complications and 
increased risk of 1-year mortality.

BACKGROUND Acute exacerbation of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (AECOPD) 
is significantly associated with increased mortality. The current study aimed to 
investigate the predictive ability of the prognostic nutritional index (PNI) in 
30-day mortality among AECOPD patients admitted to the ICU. MATERIAL AND METHODS 
Clinical data were extracted from the Medical Information Mart for Intensive 
Care-III (MIMIC-III) database. Patients were divided into 3 groups according to 
the tertiles of PNI. Cox proportional hazard regressions were performed to 
assess the association between PNI and 30-day mortality. Subgroup analyses were 
performed to identify the consistency of the association. Receiver operator 
characteristic (ROC) curve analysis was performed to evaluate the predictive 
accuracy among PNI, serum albumin, neutrophil-to-lymphocyte (NLR), and 
platelet-to-lymphocyte ratio (PLR). RESULTS A total of 494 AECOPD patients were 
included in this study. The mean age was 70.8±10.4 years old. Kaplan-Meier 
analysis showed ongoing divergence in rates of mortality among tertiles 
(p<0.001). After adjusting for confounders, high PNI tertile was an independent 
favorable predictor of 30-day mortality (HR=0.39; 95% CI, 0.19-0.80; p=0.011) 
compared to low tertile reference. Subgroup analysis showed that the predictive 
ability of PNI was especially suitable for patients aged >70 years and with 
mechanical ventilation. The cut-off value of PNI was 31.8 with sensitivity 62.3% 
and specificity 64.1%. The area under the ROC of PNI (0.642, 95% CI, 0.560 to 
0.717) was better than that of serum albumin, NLR, and PLR. CONCLUSIONS PNI 
could serve as a simple and reliable prognostic biomarker for AECOPD patients in 
the ICU.

BACKGROUND: The association between the serum anion gap (AG) and prognosis of 
patients with spontaneous subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH) remains unknown. Thus, 
this study aimed to explore the association between AG levels and mortality in 
patients with SAH in the intensive care unit (ICU).
METHODS: This was a retrospective analysis of data stored in the Medical 
Information Mart for Intensive Care-IV and eICU Collaborative Research 
databases. Critically ill patients diagnosed with spontaneous SAH were included. 
The primary outcome measure was in-hospital all-cause mortality. A multivariate 
Cox proportional hazards regression model and a restricted cubic spline were 
used to evaluate the relationship between AG concentration and outcomes. 
Kaplan-Meier curves were used to compare cumulative survival among patients with 
AG levels.
RESULTS: A total of 1,114 patients were enrolled. AG concentration was 
significantly associated with in-hospital all-cause mortality [hazard ratio 
([HR], 1.076 (95% confidence interval (CI), 1.021-1.292; p = 0.006)]. The risk 
of mortality was higher in the Category 2 group (AG ≥10 mmol/L and <13 mmol/L; 
HR, 1.961; 95% CI, 1.157-3.324; p = 0.0) and the Category 3 group (AG ≥13 
mmol/L; HR, 2.151; 95% CI, 1.198-3.864; p = 0.010) than in the Category 1 group 
(AG < 10 mmol/L). Cumulative survival rates were significantly lower in patients 
with higher AG levels (log-rank p < 0.001).
CONCLUSIONS: In-hospital and ICU mortalities increase with increasing AG 
concentration in patients with SAH. An increased serum AG level is an 
independent, significant, and robust predictor of all-cause mortality. Thus, 
serum AG levels may be used in the risk stratification of SAH.

BACKGROUND: Septic shock is associated with increased mortality. Predicting 
mortality, including early prediction for septic shock patients in intensive 
care units (ICUs), remains an important challenge.
METHOD: We searched the Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care IV database. 
Odds ratios (ORs) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) of the relationships 
between shock index (SI), modified SI (MSI), and diastolic SI (DSI) of patients 
with septic shock requiring vasopressors and 3-day/in-hospital mortality were 
calculated using logistic regression models. The time-course changes of these 
parameters were compared between survivors and non-survivors. The performance of 
the different parameters was described by the area under the receiver operating 
characteristic (ROC) curve (AUC) and compared with DeLong analysis.
RESULTS: A total of 1266 patients with septic shock requiring vasopressors were 
identified. The 3-day mortality rate and in-hospital mortality rate were 8.7% 
and 23.5%, respectively. Multivariable logistic regression analysis showed 
significant associations between pre-vasopressor SI/MSI/DSI and 3-day mortality 
in patients with septic shock requiring vasopressors in fully adjusted models 
(Ps for trend < 0.01). The AUCs of pre-vasopressor SI, MSI, and DSI were 0.746, 
0.710, and 0.732 for 3-day mortality, respectively. There were significant 
differences in the time-course of SI, MSI, and DSI between survivors and 
non-survivors at 3-day/in-hospital mortality among patients with septic shock 
requiring vasopressors (repeated-measures ANOVA, inter-subjects difference 
P < 0.001).
CONCLUSION: Pre-vasopressor SI, MSI, and DSI values identified patients with 
septic shock requiring vasopressors who are at increased risk of early death. Of 
these easy-to-acquire values, SI and MSI show a comparatively better 
performance.

The association between lactate dehydrogenase to serum albumin ratio and 
in-hospital mortality in patients with pulmonary embolism: a retrospective 
analysis of the MIMIC-IV database.

China.

BACKGROUND: Lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) and albumin (ALB) were found to be 
significantly correlated with mortality in pulmonary embolism (PE) patients. 
However, data regarding the LDH/ALB ratio (LAR) in patients with acute PE are 
scanty. Therefore, the aim of this study was to investigate the association 
between LAR and the risk of mortality in patients with acute PE.
METHODS: A retrospective cohort study was conducted on patients with acute PE 
represented in the Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care IV (MIMIC-IV). A 
receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis and calibration curve 
were used to assess the accuracy of the LAR for predicting mortality in patients 
with acute PE. We utilized Cox regression analysis to determine adjusted hazard 
ratios (HR) and 95% confidence interval (CI). Survival curves were used to 
evaluate a connection between the LAR and prognosis in patients with acute PE.
RESULTS: The study comprised 581 patients, and the 30-day all-cause mortality 
rate was 7.7%. We observed a higher LAR in the non-survival group compared to 
the surviving group (21.24 ± 21.22 vs. 8.99 ± 7.86, p < 0.0001). The 
Kaplan-Meier analysis showed that patients with an elevated LAR had a 
significantly lower likelihood of surviving the 30-day mortality compared to 
those with a low LAR. Cox regression analysis showed that LAR (HR = 1.04, 95% 
CI: 1.03-1.05) might have associations with 30-day mortality in patients with 
acute PE. This result was supported by sensitivity analyses. According to the 
results of the ROC curve analysis, the LAR's prediction of 30-day mortality in 
patients with acute PE yielded an area under the ROC curve of 0.73. A 
calibration curve showed LAR is well calibrated.
CONCLUSION: Our research suggests LAR monitoring may be promising as a 
prognostic marker among patients with acute PE.

BACKGROUND: Malnutrition is associated with poor outcomes for geriatric patients 
in intensive care unit (ICU). It is important to identify patients at risk of 
malnutrition and provide individual nutrition support. The assessment of 
malnutrition risk is not easy for these patients due to their cognitive 
impairment. Geriatric nutrition risk index (GNRI) is a simple and objective 
scoring tool to evaluate the risk of malnutrition in elderly patients. In this 
study, we aimed to see whether GNRI score was appropriate to predict clinical 
outcomes among geriatric patients in the setting of ICU.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: Elderly patients with age ≥ 65 years were extracted from 
Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care IV (MIMIC-IV) database. Categories 
based on GNRI were classified as major risk (GNRI <82), moderate risk (GNRI 82 
to <92), low risk (GNRI 92 to ≤98), and no risk (GNRI >98). The primary outcome 
was all-cause hospital mortality. Multivariable Cox proportional hazards 
regression models and restricted cubic spline were used to investigate 
associations of GNRI with hospital mortality, respectively. A two-piecewise 
linear regression model was applied to examine the inflection point of GNRI on 
hospital mortality. To reduce selection bias, propensity score matching (PSM) 
was used in a 1:1 ratio.
RESULTS: A total of 3,696 geriatric patients were finally included with median 
age 75 (69, 81) years. The prevalence of major risk was 28.6%. In the fully 
adjusted model, GNRI categories featured a negative trend with hospital 
mortality (p for trend = 0.037). Restricted cubic spline analysis demonstrated 
an L-shaped relationship between GNRI and hospital mortality before and after 
matching. The inflection point was 78.7. At the left side of inflection point, 
GNRI levels were significantly negatively associated with hospital mortality 
(HR = 0.96, 95% CI: 0.94-0.98; p < 0.001) and featured no significant relations 
at the right side. Multiple linear regression also showed that GNRI was 
negatively associated with length of stay in hospital.
CONCLUSION: The major risk of malnutrition defined by GNRI was able to predict 
poor prognosis for geriatric patients admitted to ICU.

BACKGROUND: It is not uncommon that atrial fibrillation (AF) coexists with left 
bundle branch block (LBBB). Whether LBBB is an independent predictor of poor 
prognosis in AF patients remains undetermined. This study aims to investigate 
the impact of LBBB on the AF-related outcomes in non-valvular AF patients.
METHODS: The clinical data of AF patients were collected from the Medical 
Information Mart for Intensive Care-III (MIMIC-III) database. The frequencies of 
acute arterial embolism events (AEE) and in-hospital cardiac death were compared 
between the non-LBBB and LBBB groups. And, their 1-year mortality was assessed 
through a survival analysis model. Additionally, the two groups were matched in 
a 1:2 ratio by a propensity score matching (PSM) method according to the 
CHA2DS2VASc score and AF type.
RESULTS: 5051 patients diagnosed with non-valvular AF without apparent 
structural heart disease were enrolled in this study, among them, there were 65 
with LBBB which had more AEE (13.8% vs 6.8%, p = 0.04). After PSM, with balanced 
CHA2DS2VASc score and AF type, LBBB was still related with AEE (13.8% vs 3.8%, p 
= 0.02) significantly, and it was also independent of heart failure (HF) (odds 
ratios (OR) 6.38, 95% confidence intervals (CI) [1.10, 36.93], p = 0.04). LBBB 
was also correlated with in-hospital cardiac death (OR 5.33, 95% CI [1.01, 
28.28], p = 0.04). And, the LBBB patients had a lower 1-year survival rate in 
the subgroup of HF (67.6% vs 83.0%, p = 0.06).
CONCLUSIONS: The LBBB was an independent risk factor of AEE and related to 
in-hospital cardiac death and 1-year all-cause mortality in this non-valvular AF 
cohort from MIMIC-III.

OBJECTIVES: Sepsis is an evolving process and proposed subtypes may change over 
time. We hypothesized that previously established sepsis subtypes are dynamic, 
prognostic of outcome, and trajectories are associated with host response 
alterations.
DESIGN: A secondary analysis of two observational critically ill sepsis cohorts: 
the Molecular diAgnosis and Risk stratification of Sepsis (MARS) and the Medical 
Information Mart for Intensive Care-IV (MIMIC-IV).
SETTING: ICUs in the Netherlands and United States between 2011-2014 and 
2008-2019, respectively.
PARTICIPANTS: Patient admission fulfilling the Sepsis-3 criteria upon ICU 
admission adjudicated to one of four previously identified subtypes, comprising 
2,416 admissions in MARS and 10,745 in MIMIC-IV.
MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Subtype stability and the changes per subtype on 
days 2, 4 and 7 of ICU admission were assessed. Next, the associated between 
change in clinical subtype and outcome and host response alterations.
RESULTS: In MARS, upon ICU admission, 6% (n = 150) of the patient admissions 
were α-type, 3% (n = 70) β-type, 55% (n = 1317) γ-type, and 36% (n = 879) 
δ-type; in MIMIC-IV, this was α = 22% (n = 2398), β = 22% (n = 2365), γ = 31% (n 
= 3296), and δ = 25% (2686). Overall, prevalence of subtypes was stable over 
days 2, 4, and 7. However, 28-56% (MARS/MIMIC-IV) changed from α on ICU 
admission to any of the other subtypes on day 2, 33-71% from β, 57-32% from γ, 
and 50-48% from δ. On day 4, overall subtype persistence was 33-36%. γ or δ 
admissions remaining in, or transitioning to, subtype γ on days 2, 4, and 7 
exhibited lower mortality rates compared with those remaining in, or 
transitioning to, subtype δ. Longitudinal host response biomarkers reflecting 
inflammation, coagulation, and endothelial dysfunction were most altered in the 
δ-δ group, followed by the γ-δ group, independent of the day or biomarker 
domain.
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: In two large cohorts, subtype change to δ was 
associated with worse clinical outcome and more aberrant biomarkers reflecting 
inflammation, coagulation, and endothelial dysfunction. These findings 
underscore the importance of monitoring sepsis subtypes and their linked host 
responses for improved prognostication and personalized treatment strategies.

OBJECTIVES: The study aimed to investigate the relationship between blood 
pressure (BP) levels and mortality among critically ill older adults in the 
intensive care unit (ICU), establish optimal BP target for this population, and 
assess the mediating effect of severe malnutrition on BP-related mortality.
METHODS: Data were extracted from the Medical Information Mart for Intensive 
Care IV version 2.2 database, focusing on critically ill patients aged 80 years 
and older. The analysis included various BP parameters, such as systolic BP 
(SBP), diastolic BP (DBP), and mean arterial pressure (MAP).
RESULTS: The study cohort comprised 14,660 critically ill patients, of whom 1558 
(10.6 %) experienced ICU mortality and 2493 (17.0 %) experienced in-hospital 
mortality. Lower BP levels (SBP ≤ 112 mmHg; DBP ≤ 53 mmHg; MAP ≤65 mmHg), were 
associated with an increased risk of both ICU and in-hospital mortality. 
Notably, only reduced SBP levels were linked to a higher risk of 1-year 
mortality, with an adjusted hazard ratio 1.13 (95 % confidence interval 1.05 to 
1.23). Additionally, severe malnutrition was identified as a mediator in the 
relationship between low BP levels and ICU mortality, with BP levels positively 
correlated with prognostic nutritional indexes.
CONCLUSION: Among critically ill older adults, lower BP levels are significantly 
associated with higher risks of ICU and in-hospital mortality, while reduced SBP 
levels are linked to 1-year mortality. These findings emphasize the importance 
of assessing nutritional status in older ICU patients with low BP levels to 
potentially mitigate mortality risk.

BACKGROUND: This study aims to assess the influence of early serum phosphate 
fluctuation on the short-term prognosis of sepsis patients.
METHODS: This retrospective study used the Medical Information Mart for 
Intensive Care IV database to analyze serum phosphate levels in sepsis patients 
within 3 days of ICU admission. According to the absolute value of delta serum 
phosphate (the maximum value minus the minimum value of serum phosphorus 
measured within three days), the patients were divided into four groups, 0-1.3, 
1.4-2.0, 2.1-3.1, and ≥ 3.2 mg/dl. Meanwhile, the direction of delta serum 
phosphate was compared. With the serum phosphate change group of 0-1.3 mg/dl as 
the reference group, the relationship between delta serum phosphate and 
in-hospital mortality and 28-day mortality was analyzed by multivariate 
Logistics regression analysis.
RESULTS: The study involved 1375 sepsis patients. Serum phosphate changes 
(0-1.3, 1.4-2.0, 2.1-3.1, and ≥ 3.2 mg/dl) correlated with in-hospital and 
28-day mortality variations (p = 0.005, p = 0.008). Much higher serum phosphate 
fluctuation elevated in-hospital and 28-day mortality. Compared to the 
0-1.3 mg/dl change group, adjusted odds ratios (OR) in other groups for 
in-hospital mortality were 1.25 (0.86-1.81), 1.28 (0.88-1.86), and 1.63 
(1.10-2.43), and for 28-day mortality were 1.21 (0.86-1.72), 1.10 (0.77-1.57), 
and 1.49 (1.03-2.19). Under the trend of increasing serum phosphate, the ORs of 
in-hospital mortality and 28-day mortality in ≥ 3.2 mg/dl group were 2.52 and 
2.01, respectively.
CONCLUSION: In conclude, the delta serum phosphate ≥ 3.2 mg/dl was associated 
with in-hospital mortality and 28-day mortality in patients with sepsis.

BACKGROUND: Studies have proven that the risk of acute kidney injury (AKI) 
increased in patients with malnutrition. Prognostic nutritional index (PNI) and 
geriatric nutritional risk index (GNRI) were general tools to predict the risk 
of mortality, but the prognostic value of them for in-hospital mortality among 
patients with AKI have not been validated yet. Herein, this study aims to 
explore the association between PNI and GNRI and 30-day mortality in patients 
with AKI.
METHODS: Demographic and clinical data of 863 adult patients with AKI were 
extracted from the Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care III (MIMIC-III) 
database in 2001-2012 in this retrospective cohort study. Univariate and 
multivariate Cox proportional regression analyses were used to explore the 
association between PNI and GNRI and 30-day mortality. The evaluation indexes 
were hazard ratios (HRs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs). Subgroup analyses 
of age, Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (SOFA) score and Simplified Acute 
Physiology (SAPS-II) score were also performed.
RESULTS: Totally, 222 (26.71%) patients died within 30 days. After adjusting for 
covariates, PNI ≥ 28.5 [HR = 0.71, 95%CI: (0.51-0.98)] and GNRI ≥ 83.25 
[HR = 0.63, 95%CI: (0.47-0.86)] were both associated with low risk of 30-day 
mortality. These relationships were also found in patients who aged ≥ 65 years 
old. Differently, high PNI level was associated with low risk of 30-day 
mortality among patients with SOFA score < 6 or SAPS-II score < 43, while high 
GNRI was associated with low risk of 30-day mortality among those who with SOFA 
score ≥ 6 or SAPS-II score ≥ 43 (all P < 0.05).
CONCLUSION: PNI and GNRI may be potential predictors of 30-day mortality in 
patients with AKI. Whether the PNI is more recommended for patients with mild 
AKI, while GNRI for those with severe AKI is needed further exploration.

PURPOSE: Coagulation disorder in congestive heart failure (CHF) has been 
well-documented. The prognostic value of a composite coagulation disorder score, 
which combines the absolute platelet count, international normalized ratio 
(INR), and activated partial thromboplastin time (APTT), has not been assessed 
in CHF. The present study endeavored to explore the association between the 
coagulation disorder score and adverse outcomes of critically ill patients with 
CHF.
METHODS: Patients diagnosed with CHF in the Medical Information Mart for 
Intensive Care III (MIMIC-III) database were included in the present 
retrospective cohort study. The coagulation disorder score was calculated 
according to the abnormalities of the absolute platelet count, INR, and APTT 
within 24 h after intensive care unit admission. The primary outcomes were the 
short-term all-cause mortality, including 30-, 90-day and in-hospital 
mortalities. The Kaplan-Meier (K-M) survival curve and the Cox proportional 
hazard model were performed to assess the correlation between coagulation 
disorder score and outcome events.
RESULTS: A total of 6,895 patients were enrolled in this study and divided into 
four groups according to the coagulation disorder score. K-M survival curve 
preliminarily indicated that subjects with higher coagulation disorder score 
presented lower survival rate and shorter survival time. After adjustment for 
potential confounders, the multivariate Cox analysis further illustrated that 
elevated coagulation disorder score as a quartile variable was significantly 
associated with increased all-cause mortality (quartile 4 vs. quartile 1, 
30-day: HR [95% CI], 1.98 [1.50, 2.62], 90-day: HR [95% CI], 1.88 [1.49, 2.37], 
in-hospital: HR [95%CI], 1.93 [1.42, 2.61]).
CONCLUSION: In critically ill patients with CHF, ones with high coagulation 
disorder score tend to be worse clinical prognosis, which would be a promising 
biomarker and helpful for the management of CHF patients.

OBJECTIVE: To investigate the association between the glucose-to-lymphocyte 
ratio (GLR) and prognosis of patients with sepsis-associated acute kidney injury 
(SA-AKI).
METHODS: Based on the Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care-IV (MIMIC-IV), 
SA-AKI patients aged ≥ 18 years were selected. According to the tertiles of GLR, 
the patients were divided into GLR1 group (GLR ≤ 4.97×10-9 mmol), GLR2 group 
(4.97×10-9 mmol < GLR < 9.75×10-9 mmol) and GLR3 group (GLR ≥ 9.75×10-9 mmol). 
Patients with SA-AKI were divided into survival group and death group according 
to whether they survived 28 days after admission. The patient's gender, age, 
vital signs, laboratory test results, comorbidities, sequential organ failure 
assessment (SOFA), acute physiology score III (APS III) score and treatment 
measures were extracted from the database. Kaplan-Meier survival analysis was 
used to make the survival curves of patients with SA-AKI at 28 days, 90 days, 
180 days and 1 year. Multivariate Logistic regression analysis model was used to 
explore the independent risk factors of 28-day mortality in patients with 
SA-AKI. Receiver operator characteristic curve (ROC curve) was used to analyze 
the predictive efficacy of GLR for the prognosis of patients with SA-AKI.
RESULTS: A total of 1 524 patients with SA-AKI were included, with a median age 
of 68.28 (58.96, 77.24) years old, including 612 females (40.16%) and 912 males 
(59.84%). There were 507 patients in the GLR1 group, 509 patients in the GLR2 
group and 508 patients in the GLR3 group. There were 1 181 patients in the 
28-day survival group and 343 patients in the death group. Grouping according to 
GLR tertiles showed that with the increase of GLR, the 28-day, 90-day, 180-day 
and 1-year mortality of SA-AKI patients gradually increased (28-day mortality 
were 11.64%, 22.00%, 33.86%, respectively; 90-day mortality were 15.98%, 26.72%, 
40.55%, respectively; 180-day mortality were 17.16%, 28.29% and 41.73%, and the 
1-year mortality were 17.95%, 29.27% and 42.72%, respectively, all P < 0.01). 
According to 28-day survival status, the GLR of the death group was 
significantly higher than that of the survival group [×10-9 mmol: 9.81 (5.75, 
20.01) vs. 6.44 (3.64, 10.78), P < 0.01]. Multivariate Logistic regression 
analysis showed that GLR was an independent risk factor for 28-day mortality in 
patients with SA-AKI [when GLR was used as a continuous variable: odds ratio 
(OR) = 1.065, 95% confidence interval (95%CI) was 1.045-1.085, P < 0.001; when 
GLR was used as a categorical variable, compared with GLR1 group: GLR2 group OR 
= 1.782, 95%CI was 1.200-2.647, P = 0.004; GLR3 group OR = 2.727, 95%CI was 
1.857-4.005, P < 0.001]. ROC curve analysis showed that the area under the ROC 
curve (AUC) of GLR for predicting 28-day mortality in patients with SA-AKI was 
0.674, when the optimal cut-off value was 8.769×10-9 mmol, the sensitivity was 
57.1% and the specificity was 67.1%. The predictive performance was improved 
when GLR was combined with APS III score and SOFA score, and the AUC was 0.806, 
the sensitivity was 74.6% and the specificity was 71.4%.
CONCLUSIONS: GLR is an independent risk factor of 28-day mortality in patients 
with SA-AKI, and high GLR is associated with poor prognosis in patients with 
SA-AKI.

BACKGROUND: Hemodynamic management is of paramount importance in patients with 
septic shock. Echocardiography has been increasingly used in assessing volume 
status and cardiac function. However, whether the utilization of 
echocardiography has an impact on prognosis is unknown. Thus, we intended to 
explore its effect on the outcomes of patients with septic shock.
METHODS: The study was based on the Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care 
(MIMIC) III database. Septic shock patients were divided into two groups 
according to the usage of echocardiography during the onset of septic shock. The 
primary outcome was 28-day mortality. Secondary outcomes included the usage of 
inotropes, ventilation-free and norepinephrine-free time, and fluids input. 
Propensity-score matching was used to reduce the imbalance.
RESULTS: Among 3,291 eligible patients, 1,289 patients who underwent 
echocardiography (Echo), and 1,289 who did not receive the Echo, had similar 
propensity scores and were included in the analyses. After matching, the Echo 
group had a significantly lower 28-day mortality (33.2% vs. 37.7%, P=0.019). 
More patients in the Echo group received pulmonary artery catheter (PAC) (4.2% 
vs. 0.2%, P<0.001) and inotropes (17.8% vs. 7.1%, P<0.001). In the survival 
analysis, Echo utilization was associated with improved 28-day mortality [hazard 
ratio (HR): 0.83; 95% confidence interval (CI), 0.73-0.95, P=0.005]. A reduced 
likelihood of 28-day mortality in patients with Echo vs. those without Echo was 
maintained either when excluding patients receiving multiple echocardiography 
scans (HR, 0.82; 95% CI, 0.72-0.94; P=0.004) or when excluding patients 
undergoing PAC or pulse index continuous cardiac output (PiCCO) (HR, 0.87; 95% 
CI, 0.76-0.99; P=0.034).
CONCLUSIONS: Utilization of echocardiography was associated with improved 28-day 
outcomes in patients with septic shock.

BACKGROUND: Lung infection is a common cause of sepsis, and patients with sepsis 
and lung infection are more ill and have a higher mortality rate than sepsis 
patients without lung infection. We constructed a nomogram prediction model to 
accurately evaluate the prognosis of and provide treatment advice for patients 
with sepsis and lung infection.
METHODS: Data were retrospectively extracted from the Medical Information Mart 
for Intensive Care (MIMIC-III) open-source clinical database. The definition of 
Sepsis 3.0 [10] was used, which includes patients with life-threatening organ 
dysfunction caused by an uncontrolled host response to infection, and SOFA 
score ≥ 2. The nomogram prediction model was constructed from the training set 
using logistic regression analysis, and was then internally validated and 
underwent sensitivity analysis.
RESULTS: The risk factors of age, lactate, temperature, oxygenation index, BUN, 
lactate, Glasgow Coma Score (GCS), liver disease, cancer, organ transplantation, 
Troponin T(TnT), neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio (NLR), and CRRT, MV, and 
vasopressor use were included in the nomogram. We compared our nomogram with the 
Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (SOFA) score and Simplified Acute Physiology 
Score II (SAPSII), the nomogram had better discrimination ability, with areas 
under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUROC) of 0.743 (95% C.I.: 
0.713-0.773) and 0.746 (95% C.I.: 0.699-0.790) in the training and validation 
sets, respectively. The calibration plot indicated that the nomogram was 
adequate for predicting the in-hospital mortality risk in both sets. The 
decision-curve analysis (DCA) of the nomogram revealed that it provided net 
benefits for clinical use over using the SOFA score and SAPSII in both sets.
CONCLUSION: Our new nomogram is a convenient tool for accurate predictions of 
in-hospital mortality among ICU patients with sepsis and lung infection. 
Treatment strategies that improve the factors considered relevant in the model 
could increase in-hospital survival for these ICU patients.

Thyroid dysfunction is common in critical illness and may influence prognosis. 
However, the value of TSH in patients with severe diseases remains unclear. The 
aim of this study was to investigate the association between TSH and the 
clinical prognosis of critically ill patients. Methods: This retrospective study 
identified patients who were admitted to the ICU in the Medical Information Mart 
for Intensive Care (MIMIC-IV) database (version 2.2). A total of 6432 patients 
were divided into four groups based on TSH quartiles (Q1, <0.92 mIU/L; Q2, 
0.92-1.07 mIU/L; Q3, 1.07-3.10 mIU/L; Q4, >3.10 mIU/L). The clinical outcomes 
were defined as all-cause 7-, 30-, and 90-year mortality after ICU admission. 
Restricted cubic splines (RCSs) for nonlinear associations were generated to 
visualize the relationship between TSH levels and clinical outcomes. The 
survival differences among the four groups were also analyzed using Kaplan‒Meier 
curves and log rank tests. Univariable and multivariable Cox proportional 
hazards regression were further used to assess the association between TSH 
levels and clinical outcomes. Results: After multivariate adjustment, a U-shaped 
relationship was observed between TSH levels and all-cause 7-, 30-, and 90- 
mortality among patients with severe disease (all P < 0.05 for nonlinearity). 
The plot showed a risk reduction in the low range of TSH, which reached the 
lowest risk at approximately 2.9 μIU/mL and then increased thereafter. Compared 
with patients with Q3 TSH levels, those with Q1, Q2, and Q4 TSH levels had a 
significantly higher risk of all-cause 30-day mortality (Q1: hazard ratio, 1.28; 
95% CI, 1.06-1.54; Q2: hazard ratio, 1.22; 95% CI, 1.01-1.48; Q4: hazard ratio, 
1.25; 95% CI, 1.04-1.50). For all-cause 90-day mortality, only the Q4 group had 
a significantly higher mortality risk than the Q3 group (hazard ratio, 1.24; 95% 
CI, 1.07-1.44). In subgroup analyses, we found that Q1 TSH levels were 
associated with higher mortality risk in men and older (≥65 years) patients, 
while Q4 TSH had a greater risk in men and younger (<65 years) patients. 
Conclusions: TSH was significantly associated with all-cause 7-, 30-, and 90-day 
mortality in critically ill patients after admission to the ICU. TSH may serve 
as a valuable biomarker for risk stratification in critically ill patients.

BACKGROUND: The triglyceride glucose-body mass (TyG-BMI) index is acknowledged 
as both a reliable indicator of the risk of cardiovascular disease and an 
accurate surrogate biomarker for evaluating insulin resistance (IR). The 
importance of the TyG-BMI index among people with heart failure (HF), however, 
requires more investigation. The objective of this study was to inquire about 
the relationship between HF patients' TyG-BMI index and their risk of 360-day 
mortality.
METHODS: The Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care (MIMIC-IV) database 
provided the study's patient data, which were divided into quartiles according 
to their TyG-BMI index. The endpoint was mortality from all causes within 360 
days. Kaplan-Meier analysis was used to compare this primary endpoint amongst 
the four groups indicated above. The association between the TyG-BMI index and 
the endpoint was investigated using restricted cubic splines and Cox 
proportional hazards analysis.
RESULTS: The study enrolled a total of 423 patients with HF (59.2% male), of 
whom 70 patients (16.9%) died within 360 days. Patients with higher TyG-BMI 
indexes had significantly lower mortality risks, according to the Kaplan-Meier 
analysis (log-rank P = 0.003). Furthermore, the restricted cubic spline analysis 
illustrated a decrease in the risk of all-cause mortality with an increasing 
TyG-BMI index. Additionally, multivariable Cox proportional hazards analyses 
showed that the risk of 360-day death from all causes was considerably higher in 
the lowest quartile of TyG-BMI. In comparison to the lowest TyG-BMI group, the 
fully adjusted Cox model yielded a hazard ratio (HR) of 0.24 (95% CI: 0.10, 
0.59; p = 0.002) for 360-day mortality.
CONCLUSIONS: In patients diagnosed with HF, a lower TyG-BMI index is strongly 
related to a higher risk of 360-day mortality. This index can be employed to 
categorize the risk levels of patients with HF and predict their one-year 
all-cause mortality .

BACKGROUND: Sepsis is a leading cause of morbidity and mortality in hospitalized 
patients. Up to now, there are no well-established longitudinal networks from 
molecular mechanisms to clinical phenotypes in sepsis. Adding to the problem, 
about one of the five patients presented with diabetes. For this subgroup, 
management is difficult, and prognosis is difficult to evaluate.
METHODS: From the three databases, a total of 7,001 patients were enrolled on 
the basis of sepsis-3 standard and diabetes diagnosis. Input variable selection 
is based on the result of correlation analysis in a handpicking way, and 53 
variables were left. A total of 5,727 records were collected from Medical 
Information Mart for Intensive Care database and randomly split into a training 
set and an internal validation set at a ratio of 7:3. Then, logistic regression 
with lasso regularization, Bayes logistic regression, decision tree, random 
forest, and XGBoost were conducted to build the predictive model by using 
training set. Then, the models were tested by the internal validation set. The 
data from eICU Collaborative Research Database (n = 815) and dtChina critical 
care database (n = 459) were used to test the model performance as the external 
validation set.
RESULTS: In the internal validation set, the accuracy values of logistic 
regression with lasso regularization, Bayes logistic regression, decision tree, 
random forest, and XGBoost were 0.878, 0.883, 0.865, 0.883, and 0.882, 
respectively. Likewise, in the external validation set 1, lasso regularization = 
0.879, Bayes logistic regression = 0.877, decision tree = 0.865, random forest = 
0.886, and XGBoost = 0.875. In the external validation set 2, lasso 
regularization = 0.715, Bayes logistic regression = 0.745, decision tree = 
0.763, random forest = 0.760, and XGBoost = 0.699.
CONCLUSION: The top three models for internal validation set were Bayes logistic 
regression, random forest, and XGBoost, whereas the top three models for 
external validation set 1 were random forest, logistic regression, and Bayes 
logistic regression. In addition, the top three models for the external 
validation set 2 were decision tree, random forest, and Bayes logistic 
regression. Random forest model performed well with the training and three 
validation sets. The most important features are age, albumin, and lactate.

BACKGROUND: Patients with rheumatic diseases have an increased likelihood of 
being admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU), highlighting the importance of 
promptly identifying high-risk individuals to enhance prognosis. This study 
aimed to assess the correlation of red blood cell distribution width to albumin 
ratio (RAR) with the 90-days and 360-days survival rates among critically ill 
rheumatic patients.
METHODS: Adult rheumatic patients admitted to the ICU from the Medical 
Information Mart for Intensive Care IV (MIMIC-IV) database were included. The 
participants were categorized into two groups, survivors (n = 436) and 
non-survivors (n = 192), based on their 90-days survival outcome. The population 
was further classified into tertiles using RAR values, with RAR < 4.63 
(n = 208), 4.63-6.07 (n = 211), and > 6.07 (n = 209). Kaplan-Meier curves were 
utilized to evaluate the cumulative survival rates at 90-days and 360-days. The 
association between RAR and mortality was assessed using restricted cubic 
splines (RCS) and multivariate Cox regression analysis. Additional subgroup 
analyses and sensitivity analyses were conducted to further explore the 
findings. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves were generated to 
evaluate the predictive performance of RAR.
RESULTS: This study involved 628 critically ill patients with rheumatic 
diseases, and they had an all-cause mortality of 30.57% at 90-days and 38.69% at 
360-days. Kaplan-Meier analysis showed a gradual decrease in both 90-days and 
360-days cumulative survival with increasing RAR (χ2 = 24.400, p < 0.001; 
χ2 = 35.360, p < 0.001). RCS revealed that RAR was linearly related to 90-days 
and 360-days all-cause mortality risk for critically ill patients with rheumatic 
diseases (χ2 = 4.360, p = 0.225; χ2 = 1.900, p = 0.594). Cox regression analysis 
indicated that elevated RAR (> 6.07) was significantly correlated with 
mortality. The ROC curves demonstrated that an optimal cut-off value of RAR for 
predicting 90-days mortality was determined to be 5.453, yielding a sensitivity 
of 61.5% and specificity of 60.3%.
CONCLUSION: Elevated RAR (> 6.07) was associated with all-cause mortality at 
90-days and 360-days among critically ill patients with rheumatic diseases, 
serving as an independent risk factor for unfavorable prognosis.

BACKGROUND: The CHA2DS2-VASc score has been associated with the prognosis of 
cardiovascular diseases. This study aimed to explore the association between the 
CHA2DS2-VASc score and all-cause mortality in coronary care unit (CCU) patients.
METHODS: The study was based on the Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care 
(MIMIC) III database. CCU patients were divided into two groups according to 
CHA2DS2-VASc score: 0-3 (low risk)，4-9 (intermediate and high risk). The primary 
outcome was 30-day mortality, and the secondary endpoints included in-hospital, 
1-year, and 5-year mortality. Propensity score matching (PSM) and sensitivity 
analyzes for the confounders were also performed. The restricted cubic splines 
flexibility model was used to demonstrate the relation between red blood cell 
volume distribution width (RDW), blood urea nitrogen (BUN), platelet, white 
blood cell (WBC), hemoglobin, phosphorus, glucose, potassium, sodium and 30-day 
mortality in the 0-3 score versus the 4-9 score groups after PSM.
RESULTS: Among 4491 eligible patients, 988 patients with low CHA2DS2-VASc scores 
and 988 patients with intermediate and high CHA2DS2-VASc scores had similar 
propensity scores and were included in the analyzes. In the survival analysis, 
the patients with intermediate and high CHA2DS2-VASc scores were associated with 
higher 30-day mortality [hazard ratio (HR): 1.11; 95% confidence interval (CI), 
1.02-1.20, P = .014], 1-year mortality [HR: 1.13; 95%CI, 1.06-1.19, P < .001], 
and 5-year mortality [HR: 1.13; 95%CI, 1.07-1.18, P < .001]. The interaction for 
30-day mortality among subgroups was not significant between the 0-3 score 
versus the 4-9 score groups. The restricted cubic splines for 30-day mortality 
demonstrated an L-shaped trajectory for platelets and hemoglobin, a J-shaped 
trajectory for WBC, glucose and potassium, and a U-shaped trajectory for sodium, 
respectively (all nonlinear P <.001).
CONCLUSIONS: A high CHA2DS2-VASc score was an independent risk for 30-day, 
1-year, and 5-year mortality for CCU patients.

This study investigated stress hyperglycemia ratio (SHR) for acute kidney injury 
(AKI) and clinical outcomes in intensive care unit (ICU). Key outcomes were AKI 
within 48 h after ICU admission, acute kidney disease (AKD), ICU mortality, 
28-day mortality, 90-day mortality and 1-year mortality. The associations 
between SHR and outcomes was estimated via logistic regression, Cox proportional 
hazards regression, and restricted cubic spline (RCS) analyses. Subgroup 
analyses assessed the consistency of these associations. Totally 3,714 patients 
were included from the Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care IV. SHR was 
associated with an increased risk of AKI (ORadjusted 1.29 95%CI 1.05-1.59). 
Among AKI patients, SHR was associated with increased risks of AKD (ORadjusted 
1.94 95%CI 1.57-2.39), ICU mortality (ORadjusted 2.31 95%CI 1.60-3.32), 28-day 
mortality (HRadjusted 1.39 95%CI 1.29-1.50), 90-day mortality (HRadjusted 1.37 
95%CI 1.26-1.48), and 1-year mortality (HRadjusted 1.37 95%CI 1.27-1.47). RCS 
analysis revealed a linear relationship with AKI, a J-shaped relationship with 
AKD, and a U-shaped relationship with mortality. Subgroup analysis confirmed the 
consistency of relationship between SHR and AKI. SHR demonstrates significant 
associations with AKI incidence, and correlates with AKD progression/mortality 
in critically ill adult ICU patients, suggesting its potential as a risk 
stratification and prognostic tool for AKI management, though further 
prospective validation is required.

BACKGROUND: Inflammation plays a key role in the initiation and progression of 
atrial fibrillation (AF). Lymphocyte-to-monocyte ratio (LMR) has been proved to 
be a reliable predictor of many inflammation-associated diseases, but little 
data are available on the relationship between LMR and AF. We aimed to evaluate 
the predictive value of LMR in predicting all-cause mortality among AF patients.
METHODS: Data of patients diagnosed with AF were retrieved from the Medical 
Information Mart for Intensive Care-III (MIMIC-III) database. X-tile analysis 
was used to calculate the optimal cutoff value for LMR. The Cox regression model 
was used to assess the association of LMR and 28-day, 90-day, and 1-year 
mortality. Additionally, a propensity score matching (PSM) method was performed 
to minimize the impact of potential confounders.
RESULTS: A total of 3567 patients hospitalized with AF were enrolled in this 
study. The X-tile software indicated that the optimal cutoff value of LMR was 
2.67. A total of 1127 pairs were generated, and all the covariates were well 
balanced after PSM. The Cox proportional-hazards model showed that patients with 
the low LMR (≤2.67) had a higher 1-year all-cause mortality than those with the 
high LMR (>2.67) in the study cohort before PSM (HR = 1.640, 95% CI: 
1.437-1.872, p < 0.001) and after PSM (HR = 1.279, 95% CI: 1.094-1.495, 
p = 0.002). The multivariable Cox regression analysis for 28-day and 90-day 
mortality yielded similar results.
CONCLUSIONS: The lower LMR (≤2.67) was associated with a higher risk of 28-day, 
90-day, and 1-year all-cause mortality, which might serve as an independent 
predictor in AF patients.

BACKGROUND: The association between the stress hyperglycemia ratio (SHR), which 
represents the degree of acute stress hyperglycemic status, and the risk of 
mortality in cerebrovascular disease patients in the intensive care unit (ICU) 
remains unclear. This study aims to investigate the predictive ability of SHR 
for in-hospital mortality in critically ill cerebrovascular disease patients and 
to assess its potential to enhance existing predictive models.
METHODS: We extracted data from the Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care 
(MIMIC-IV) database for patients diagnosed with cerebrovascular disease and used 
Cox regression to assess the association between SHR and mortality. To 
investigate the nature of this association, we applied restricted cubic spline 
analysis to determine if it is linear. The predictive ability of SHR for 
mortality risk was evaluated using receiver operating characteristic (ROC) 
curves and the C-index.
RESULTS: We included a total of 2,461 patients, with a mean age of 70.55 ± 14.59 
years, and 1,221 (49.61%) being female. Cox regression analysis revealed that 
SHR was independently associated with both in-hospital mortality (per standard 
deviation (SD) increase: hazard ratio (HR) 1.35, 95% confidence interval (CI) 
1.23-1.48) and ICU mortality (per SD increase: HR 1.37, 95% CI 1.21-1.54). The 
risk of death increased in an approximately linear fashion when SHR exceeded 
0.77-0.79. Subgroup analysis indicated the association was more pronounced in 
non-diabetic individuals. Additionally, incorporating SHR into existing models 
improved both discrimination and reclassification performance.
CONCLUSION: SHR serves as an independent risk factor for in-hospital mortality 
in cerebrovascular disease patients in the ICU. Adding SHR to existing models 
enhances their predictive performance, offering clinical value in the 
identification of high-risk patients.

BACKGROUND: The stress hyperglycemia ratio (SHR) was developed to mitigate the 
influence of long-term chronic glycemic factors on stress hyperglycemia levels, 
which are associated with adverse clinical events, particularly cardiovascular 
events. However, studies examining the SHR index and its prognostic significance 
in patients with atrial fibrillation (AF) are lacking. This study aims to 
evaluate the relationship between the SHR index and all-cause mortality in 
critically ill patients with AF upon Intensive Care Unit admission.
METHODS: The patients' data were extracted from the Medical Information Mart for 
Intensive Care IV (MIMIC-IV) database. All patients were categorized into four 
groups based on the SHR index. The outcomes include both primary and secondary 
endpoints, with the primary endpoints being 30-day and 365-day all-cause 
mortality, and the secondary endpoints being 90-day and 180-day all-cause 
mortality. The SHR index was analyzed using quartiles, and the Kaplan-Meier 
curve was employed to compare the outcomes across groups. Cox 
proportional-hazards regression and restricted cubic splines (RCS) were used to 
assess the relationship between the SHR index and the outcomes.
RESULTS: Out of a total of 1,685 participants, the average age was 63.12 years 
(range: 40.17 to 101.49), with 1,004 (59.58%) being male. Higher levels of the 
SHR index were associated with an increased risk of all-cause mortality at 30 
days, 90 days, 180 days, and 365 days, as indicated by the Kaplan-Meier curves 
(log-rank P < 0.01). Additionally, Cox proportional-hazards regression analysis 
revealed that the risk of mortality at these time points was significantly 
higher in the highest quartile of the SHR index. Restricted cubic splines (RCS) 
analysis demonstrated U-shaped relationships between the SHR index and all-cause 
mortality, with inflection points at 0.73 for 30-day mortality and 0.76 for 
365-day mortality. Compared to patients with SHR levels below these inflection 
points, those with higher levels had a 69.9% increased risk for 30-day all-cause 
mortality (hazard ratio [HR] 1.699; 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.336 to 2.159) 
and a 61.6% increased risk for 365-day all-cause mortality (HR 1.616; 95% CI 
1.345 to 1.942).
CONCLUSION: In critically ill patients with AF, higher levels of the SHR index 
are significantly associated with an increased risk of all-cause mortality at 30 
days, 90 days, 180 days, and 365 days. The SHR index may serve as a valid 
indicator for assessing the severity and guiding the treatment of AF patients in 
the ICU.

PURPOSE: To investigate the effect of first 24-hour (24-h) urine output (UO) on 
in-hospital and 1-year mortality in patients admitted to intensive care units 
due to acute myocardial infarction.
METHODS: This was a retrospective cohort study based on the medical information 
mart for intensive care IV database involving patients admitted to intensive 
care units due to acute myocardial infarction. Patients were classified as low 
UO (LUO), high UO (HUO), and middle UO with a first 24-h UO below 800 ml, over 
2500 ml, or in between, respectively. The primary outcome was in-hospital 
mortality and the secondary outcome was 1-year mortality.
RESULTS: A total of 4337 patients were involved. Taking middle UO group as 
reference, after adjusting for confounders including age, gender, height, 
weight, comorbidity, occurrence of cardiogenic shock, revascularization, blood 
pressure, creatinine, N-terminal pro-brain natriuretic peptide, and use of loop 
diuretics, LUO was independently associated with higher in-hospital mortality 
[odds ratio 4.05, 95% confidence interval (CI): 3.12-5.26], while HUO was an 
independent protective factor (odds ratio 0.52, 95% CI: 0.35-0.77). In the 
multivariant Cox regression model, LUO was an independent risk factor for 1-year 
mortality (hazard ratio 2.65, 95% CI: 2.16-3.26), while HUO did not show 
significant association.
CONCLUSION: In patients admitted to intensive care units due to acute myocardial 
infarction, first 24-h UO <800 ml was a strong predictor for higher in-hospital 
and 1-year mortality, while first 24-h UO over 2500 ml was associated with lower 
in-hospital mortality but not long-term mortality.

BACKGROUND: Base excess (BE) represents an increase or decrease of alkali 
reserves in plasma to diagnose acid-base disorders, independent of respiratory 
factors. Current findings about the prognostic value of BE on mortality of 
patients with acute myocardial infarction (AMI) are still unclear. The purpose 
of this study was to explore the prognostic significance of BE for short-term 
all-cause mortality in patients with AMI.
METHODS: A total of 2,465 patients diagnosed with AMI in the intensive care unit 
from the Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care III (MIMIC-III) database 
were included in our study, and we explored the association of BE with 28-day 
and 90-day all-cause mortality using Cox regression analysis. We also used 
restricted cubic splines (RCS) to evaluate the relationship between BE and 
hazard ratio (HR). The primary outcomes were 28-day and 90-day all-cause 
mortality.
RESULTS: When stratified according to quantiles, low BE levels at admission were 
strongly associated with higher 28-day and 90-day all-cause mortality. 
Multivariable Cox proportional hazard models revealed that low BE was an 
independent risk factor of 28-day all-cause mortality [HR 4.158, 95% CI 
3.203-5.398 (low vs. normal BE) and HR 1.354, 95% CI 0.896-2.049 (high vs. 
normal BE)] and 90-day all-cause mortality [HR 4.078, 95% CI 3.160-5.263 (low 
vs. normal BE) and HR 1.369, 95% CI 0.917-2.045 (high vs. normal BE)], even 
after adjustment for significant prognostic covariates. The results were also 
consistent in subgroup analysis. RCS revealed an "L-type" relationship between 
BE and 28-day and 90-day all-cause mortality, as well as adjusting for 
confounding variables. Meanwhile, Kaplan-Meier survival curves were stratified 
by combining BE with carbon dioxide partial pressure (PaCO2), and patients had 
the highest mortality in the group which had low BE (< 3.5 mEq/L) and high PaCO2 
(> 45 mmHg) compared with other groups.
CONCLUSION: Our study revealed that low BE was significantly associated with 
28-day and 90-day mortality in patients with AMI and indicated the value of 
stratifying the mortality risk of patients with AMI by BE.

AIM: Acute kidney injury (AKI) and coagulation disorders are two common 
complications of traumatic brain injury (TBI) that are associated with poor 
prognosis. However, the relationship between early coagulation disorders and the 
risk of severe AKI in TBI patients remains unclear. This study aimed to explore 
the association between early coagulation disorders and the risk of severe AKI 
in TBI patients admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU).
METHODS: In this retrospective cohort study, adults diagnosed with TBI were 
selected from the Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care (MIMIC)-IV 
database. The outcome was the risk of severe AKI within 7 days of ICU admission 
in TBI patients. Covariates including sociodemographic information, vital signs, 
scoring systems, and laboratory parameters were extracted from the database. 
Univariable and multivariable Cox proportional hazard regression models were 
used to assess the association between early coagulation disorders and the risk 
of severe AKI within 7 days of admission to the ICU in TBI patients. Subgroup 
analyses based on age and the Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) score were further 
conducted to assess the association.
RESULTS: A total of 846 patients were finally included, of whom 187 (22.10%) had 
severe AKI. After adjusting for all covariates, the TBI patients with early 
coagulation disorders had a higher risk of developing severe AKI within 7 days 
of ICU admission compared to the TBI patients without early coagulation 
disorders (hazard ratio (HR) = 1.40, 95% confidence interval (CI): 1.04-1.89), 
particularly among those aged ≥65 years (HR = 1.46, 95%CI: 1.01-2.04) and those 
with a GCS score ≤ 13 (HR = 1.91, 95%CI: 1.16-3.15).
CONCLUSION: TBI patients with early coagulation disorders had a higher risk of 
developing severe AKI within 7 days of ICU admission. This may serve as a 
promising biomarker and could be helpful for managing kidney health in TBI 
patients.

BACKGROUND: The triglyceride-glucose (TyG) index is increasingly recognized for 
its ability to predict cardiovascular and metabolic risks. This study 
investigated the correlation between the TyG index and the risk of acute kidney 
injury(AKI) in critical ill patients with acute pancreatitis(AP).
METHODS: The Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care IV database was 
retrospectively searched to identify AP patients hospitalized in the intensive 
care unit. The primary outcome measure was the incidence of AKI. The secondary 
endpoint was in-hospital mortality and the rate of renal replacement 
therapy(RRT) use. Cox regression analysis and restricted cubic spline were used 
to analyze TyG index association with AKI risk. Kaplan-Meier survival analysis 
was performed to assess the incidence of endpoints in the different groups.
RESULTS: A total of 848 patients were enrolled. The incidence of AKI was 
61.56%.The in-hospital mortality was 11.69%. Kaplan-Meier analysis showed that 
the TyG index ≥ 8.78 group has a high incidence of AKI and high risk of 
requiring RRT (P < 0.001). Multivariable Cox regression analysis showed whether 
TyG index was a continuous variable (HR, 1.65 [95% CI 1.10-2.48], P = 0.015) or 
a categorical variable (HR, 1.72 [95% CI 1.09-2.79], P = 0.028), and the TyG 
index was independently associated with the risk of AKI in AP patients. The 
restricted cubic splines model illustrated the linear relationship between 
higher TyG index and increased risk of AKI in this specific patient population.
CONCLUSIONS: High TyG index is an independent risk factor for AKI in critical 
ill patients with AP. Assessing the TyG index may be beneficial for early 
stratification and interventions to improve prognosis.

BACKGROUND: This study aimed to develop and validate an interpretable 
machine-learning model that utilizes clinical features and inflammatory 
biomarkers to predict the risk of in-hospital mortality in critically ill 
patients suffering from sepsis.
METHODS: We enrolled all patients diagnosed with sepsis in the Medical 
Information Mart for Intensive Care IV (MIMIC-IV, v.2.0), eICU Collaborative 
Research Care (eICU-CRD 2.0), and the Amsterdam University Medical Centers 
databases (AmsterdamUMCdb 1.0.2). LASSO regression was employed for feature 
selection. Seven machine-learning methods were applied to develop prognostic 
models. The optimal model was chosen based on its accuracy, F1 score and area 
under curve (AUC) in the validation cohort. Moreover, we utilized the SHapley 
Additive exPlanations (SHAP) method to elucidate the effects of the features 
attributed to the model and analyze how individual features affect the model's 
output. Finally, Spearman correlation analysis examined the associations among 
continuous predictor variables. Restricted cubic splines (RCS) explored 
potential non-linear relationships between continuous risk factors and 
in-hospital mortality.
RESULTS: 3535 patients with sepsis were eligible for participation in this 
study. The median age of the participants was 66 years (IQR, 55-77 years), and 
56% were male. After selection, 12 of the 45 clinical parameters collected on 
the first day after ICU admission remained associated with prognosis and were 
used to develop machine-learning models. Among seven constructed models, the 
eXtreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost) model achieved the best performance, with an 
AUC of 0.94 and an F1 score of 0.937 in the validation cohort. Feature 
importance analysis revealed that Age, AST, invasive ventilation treatment, and 
serum urea nitrogen (BUN) were the top four features of the XGBoost model with 
the most significant impact. Inflammatory biomarkers may have prognostic value. 
Furthermore, SHAP force analysis illustrated how the constructed model 
visualized the prediction of the model.
CONCLUSIONS: This study demonstrated the potential of machine-learning 
approaches for early prediction of outcomes in patients with sepsis. The SHAP 
method could improve the interoperability of machine-learning models and help 
clinicians better understand the reasoning behind the outcome.

PURPOSE: This study was to investigate the association between albumin-corrected 
anion gap (AG) (ACAG) levels and the risk of acute kidney injury (AKI) in 
intensive care unit (ICU) patients.
METHODS: The ICU patients of this retrospective cohort study were collected from 
the Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care IV (MIMIC-IV) database between 
2008 and 2019. ACAG = AG + {4.4 - [albumin (g/dl)]} × 2.5. The incidence of AKI 
was determined using the Kidney Disease: Improving Global Outcomes (KDIGO) 
definition. The logistic regression model was used to evaluate the association 
between ACAG levels and the risk of AKI. Subgroup analyses were applied based on 
age, gender, mechanical ventilation, vasopressors, the Charlson comorbidity 
index (CCI), and the Simplified Acute Physiology Score II (SAPS II).
RESULTS: Totally, 5586 patients were enrolled, of which 1929 patients (34.53%) 
occurred AKI. The higher levels of ACAG were associated with the risk of AKI in 
ICU patients, with the odds ratio (OR) value being 1.23 [95% confidence interval 
(CI): 1.22-1.24, P = 0.005] in ACAG level between 16.5 and 19.5, and OR value 
being 1.20 (95% CI 1.16-1.24, P = 0.016) in ACAG level > 19.5. A higher ACAG 
level was associated with a higher risk of AKI in ICU patients aged < 65 years, 
in ICU patients of female gender, in ICU patients who used mechanical 
ventilation, in ICU patients who did not use vasopressors, in patients without 
cardiogenic shock, and in ICU patients with CCI ≥ 2, and SAPS II > 31 (all 
P < 0.05).
CONCLUSION: There is an association between ACAG level and the risk of AKI in 
ICU patients. A higher ACAG value in ICU patients should therefore receive more 
attention.

OBJECTIVE: To investigate the correlation between early-stage blood pressure 
indexes and prognosis in sepsis patients.
METHODS: A retrospective cohort study was conducted on the medical records of 
patients diagnosed with sepsis from 2001 to 2012 in the Medical Information Mart 
for Intensive Care-III (MIMIC-III) database. Patients were divided into survival 
group and death group according to the 28-day prognosis. General data of 
patients and heart rate (HR) and blood pressure at admission to ICU and within 
24 hours after admission were collected. The blood pressure indexes including 
the maximum, median and mean value of systolic index, diastolic index and mean 
arterial pressure (MAP) index were calculated. The data were randomly divided 
into training set and validation set (4 : 1). Univariate Logistic regression 
analysis was used to screen covariates, and multivariate Logistic stepwise 
regression models were further developed. Model 1 (including HR, blood pressure, 
and blood pressure index related variables with P < 0.1 and other variables with 
P < 0.05) and Model 2 (including HR, blood pressure, and blood pressure index 
related variables with P < 0.1) were developed respectively. The receiver 
operator characteristic curve (ROC curve), precision recall curve (PRC) and 
decision curve analysis (DCA) curve were used to evaluate the quality of the two 
models, and the influencing factors of the prognosis of sepsis patients were 
analyzed. Finally, nomogram model was developed according to the better model 
and effectiveness of it was evaluated.
RESULTS: A total of 11 559 sepsis patients were included in the study, with 10 
012 patients in the survival group and 1 547 patients in the death group. There 
were significant differences in age, survival time, Elixhauser comorbidity score 
and other 46 variables between the two groups (all P < 0.05). Thirty-seven 
variables were preliminarily screened by univariate Logistic regression 
analysis. After multivariate Logistic stepwise regression model screening, among 
the indicators related to HR, blood pressure and blood pressure index, the HR at 
admission to ICU [odds ratio (OR) = 0.992, 95% confidence interval (95%CI) was 
0.988-0.997] and the maximum HR (OR = 1.006, 95%CI was 1.001-1.011), maximum MAP 
index (OR = 1.620, 95%CI was 1.244-2.126), mean diastolic index (OR = 0.283, 
95%CI was 0.091-0.856), median systolic index (OR = 2.149, 95%CI was 
0.805-4.461), median diastolic index (OR = 3.986, 95%CI was 1.376-11.758) were 
selected (all P < 0.1). There were 14 other variables with P < 0.05, including 
age, Elixhauser comorbidity score, continuous renal replacement therapy (CRRT), 
use of ventilator, sedation and analgesia, norepinephrine, norepinephrine, 
highest serum creatinine (SCr), maximum blood urea nitrogen (BUN), highest 
prothrombin time (PT), highest activated partial thromboplastin time (APTT), 
lowest platelet count (PLT), highest white blood cell count (WBC), minimum 
hemoglobin (Hb). The ROC curve showed that the area under the curve (AUC) of 
Model 1 and Model 2 were 0.769 and 0.637, respectively, indicating that model 1 
had higher prediction accuracy. The PRC curve showed that the AUC of Model 1 and 
Model 2 were 0.381 and 0.240, respectively, indicating that Model 1 had a better 
effect. The DCA curve showed that when the threshold was 0-0.8 (the probability 
of death was 0-80%), the net benefit rate of Model 1 was higher than that of 
Model 2. The calibration curve showed that the prediction effect of the nomogram 
model developed according to Model 1 was in good agreement with the actual 
outcome. The Bootstrap verification results showed that the nomogram model was 
consistent with the above results and had good prediction effects.
CONCLUSIONS: The nomogram model constructed has good prediction effects on the 
28-day prognosis in sepsis patients, and the blood pressure indexes are 
important predictors in the model.

INTRODUCTION: The red blood cell distribution width-to-platelet ratio (RPR), a 
novel inflammatory index, has already been proven as a prognostic factor in some 
other diseases, but its prognostic effect on critically ill patients with acute 
ischemic stroke (AIS) has been rarely investigated. This study aimed to 
investigate the association between RPR and in-hospital mortality in these 
patients.
METHODS: We extracted clinical data from the Medical Information Mart for 
Intensive Care IV 1.0 database. The primary outcome was in-hospital all-cause 
mortality of patients with critical AIS. The main independent variable was RPR. 
To investigate the association between RPR and in-hospital all-cause mortality 
in patients with critical AIS, multivariable logistic analyses, smooth curve 
fitting, and stratified analyses were conducted.
RESULTS: In total, 2,673 patients with AIS who were admitted to the intensive 
care unit were included in the study. In the multivariable analysis, in-hospital 
mortality was positively related to RPR (odds ratio [OR] 1.28, 95% confidence 
interval [CI] 1.02-1.59). According to the two-piecewise logistic regression 
model, we found that the inflection point of RPR was 1.89%. To the left of the 
inflection point (RPR ≤1.89%), we did not detect any relationship between RPR 
and in-hospital all-cause mortality (OR [95% CI]: 0.73 [0.41, 1.31], p = 
0.2884). In contrast, to the right of the inflection point (RPR &gt;1.89%), RPR 
was positively related to in-hospital all-cause mortality (OR [95% CI]: 1.61 
[1.18, 2.19], p = 0.0027).
CONCLUSIONS: RPR showed a nonlinear relationship with in-hospital all-cause 
mortality in patients with critical AIS.

OBJECTIVES: To identify the clinical risk factors that influence in-hospital 
mortality in elderly patients with persistent sepsis-associated acute kidney 
injury (S-AKI) and to establish and validate a nomogram to predict in-hospital 
mortality.
DESIGN: Retrospective cohort analysis.
SETTING: Data from critically ill patients at a US centre between 2008 and 2021 
were extracted from the Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care (MIMIC)-IV 
database (V.1.0).
PARTICIPANTS: Data from 1519 patients with persistent S-AKI were extracted from 
the MIMIC-IV database.
PRIMARY OUTCOME: All-cause in-hospital death from persistent S-AKI.
RESULTS: Multiple logistic regression revealed that gender (OR 0.63, 95% CI 
0.45-0.88), cancer (2.5, 1.69-3.71), respiratory rate (1.06, 1.01-1.12), AKI 
stage (2.01, 1.24-3.24), blood urea nitrogen (1.01, 1.01-1.02), Glasgow Coma 
Scale score (0.75, 0.70-0.81), mechanical ventilation (1.57, 1.01-2.46) and 
continuous renal replacement therapy within 48 hours (9.97, 3.39-33.9) were 
independent risk factors for mortality from persistent S-AKI. The consistency 
indices of the prediction and the validation cohorts were 0.780 (95% CI: 
0.75-0.82) and 0.80 (95% CI: 0.75-0.85), respectively. The model's calibration 
plot suggested excellent consistency between the predicted and actual 
probabilities.
CONCLUSIONS: This study's prediction model demonstrated good discrimination and 
calibration abilities to predict in-hospital mortality of elderly patients with 
persistent S-AKI, although it warrants further external validation to verify its 
accuracy and applicability.

Background: Sepsis-induced coagulopathy (SIC) denotes an increased mortality 
rate and poorer prognosis in septic patients. Objectives: Our study aimed to 
develop and validate machine-learning models to dynamically predict the risk of 
SIC in critically ill patients with sepsis. Methods: Machine-learning models 
were developed and validated based on two public databases named Medical 
Information Mart for Intensive Care (MIMIC)-IV and the eICU Collaborative 
Research Database (eICU-CRD). Dynamic prediction of SIC involved an evaluation 
of the risk of SIC each day after the diagnosis of sepsis using 15 predictive 
models. The best model was selected based on its accuracy and area under the 
receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC), followed by fine-grained 
hyperparameter adjustment using the Bayesian Optimization Algorithm. A compact 
model was developed, based on 15 features selected according to their importance 
and clinical availability. These two models were compared with Logistic 
Regression and SIC scores in terms of SIC prediction. Results: Of 11,362 
patients in MIMIC-IV included in the final cohort, a total of 6,744 (59%) 
patients developed SIC during sepsis. The model named Categorical Boosting 
(CatBoost) had the greatest AUC in our study (0.869; 95% CI: 0.850-0.886). 
Coagulation profile and renal function indicators were the most important 
features for predicting SIC. A compact model was developed with an AUC of 0.854 
(95% CI: 0.832-0.872), while the AUCs of Logistic Regression and SIC scores were 
0.746 (95% CI: 0.735-0.755) and 0.709 (95% CI: 0.687-0.733), respectively. A 
cohort of 35,252 septic patients in eICU-CRD was analyzed. The AUCs of the full 
and the compact models in the external validation were 0.842 (95% CI: 
0.837-0.846) and 0.803 (95% CI: 0.798-0.809), respectively, which were still 
larger than those of Logistic Regression (0.660; 95% CI: 0.653-0.667) and SIC 
scores (0.752; 95% CI: 0.747-0.757). Prediction results were illustrated by 
SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) values, which made our models clinically 
interpretable. Conclusions: We developed two models which were able to 
dynamically predict the risk of SIC in septic patients better than conventional 
Logistic Regression and SIC scores.

OBJECTIVE: Chronic kidney disease (CKD) patients with coronary artery disease 
(CAD) in the intensive care unit (ICU) have higher in-hospital mortality and 
poorer prognosis than patients with either single condition. The objective of 
this study is to develop a novel model that can predict the in-hospital 
mortality of that kind of patient in the ICU using machine learning methods.
METHODS: Data of CKD patients with CAD were extracted from the Medical 
Information Mart for Intensive Care IV (MIMIC-IV) database. Boruta algorithm was 
conducted for the feature selection process. Eight machine learning algorithms, 
such as logistic regression (LR), random forest (RF), Decision Tree, K-nearest 
neighbors (KNN), Gradient Boosting Decision Tree Machine (GBDT), Support Vector 
Machine (SVM), Neural Network (NN), and Extreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost), 
were conducted to construct the predictive model for in-hospital mortality and 
performance was evaluated by average precision (AP) and area under the receiver 
operating characteristic curve (AUC). Shapley Additive Explanations (SHAP) 
algorithm was applied to explain the model visually. Moreover, data from the 
Telehealth Intensive Care Unit Collaborative Research Database (eICU-CRD) were 
acquired as an external validation set.
RESULTS: 3590 and 1657 CKD patients with CAD were acquired from MIMIC-IV and 
eICU-CRD databases, respectively. A total of 78 variables were selected for the 
machine learning model development process. Comparatively, GBDT had the highest 
predictive performance according to the results of AUC (0.946) and AP (0.778). 
The SHAP method reveals the top 20 factors based on the importance ranking. In 
addition, GBDT had good predictive value and a certain degree of clinical value 
in the external validation according to the AUC (0.865), AP (0.672), decision 
curve analysis, and calibration curve.
CONCLUSION: Machine learning algorithms, especially GBDT, can be reliable tools 
for accurately predicting the in-hospital mortality risk for CKD patients with 
CAD in the ICU. This contributed to providing optimal resource allocation and 
reducing in-hospital mortality by tailoring precise management and 
implementation of early interventions.

Background/Objectives: Critically ill patients with liver cirrhosis impose a 
substantial health burden on the world. Rifaximin is a potential treatment 
option for such patients. Methods: We extracted critically ill patients with 
liver cirrhosis from the Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care (MIMIC) IV 
database. Based on study outcomes, the current study included prevention and 
treatment cohorts. A 1:1 propensity score matching (PSM) analysis was performed 
to match the characteristics of patients. The risk of ICU admission and 
intensive care unit (ICU), in-hospital, 90-day, and 180-day death were explored. 
Cox regression analyses were conducted, and hazard ratios (HRs) and 95% 
confidence intervals (CIs) were calculated. Kaplan-Meier curves were further 
drawn to demonstrate the cumulative 90-day and 180-day survival rate. Results: 
Overall, 5381 critically ill patients with liver cirrhosis were included. In the 
prevention cohort, rifaximin could decrease the risk of ICU admission (HR = 
0.427, 95%CI: 0.338-0.539, p < 0.001). In the treatment cohort, rifaximin could 
decrease the risk of ICU (HR = 0.530, 95%CI: 0.311-0.902, p = 0.019) and 
in-hospital death (HR = 0.119, 95%CI: 0.033-0.429, p = 0.001) in critically ill 
patients with liver cirrhosis. However, rifaximin could not decrease the risk of 
90-day (HR = 0.905, 95%CI: 0.658-1.245, p = 0.541) and 180-day (HR = 1.043, 
95%CI: 0.804-1.353, p = 0.751) death in critically ill patients with liver 
cirrhosis. Kaplan-Meier curve analyses also showed that rifaximin could not 
significantly decrease the 90-day (p = 0.570) and 180-day (p = 0.800) cumulative 
mortality. Conclusions: This study suggests that rifaximin can significantly 
decrease the risk of ICU admission and improve short-term survival but does not 
impact long-term survival in critically ill patients with liver cirrhosis.

BACKGROUND: Coronary care unit (CCU) patients surviving to discharge still face 
significant mortality. Delirium is common in CCU patients and has been 
associated with poorer CCU and in-hospital outcomes.
AIM: To assess the association between delirium and mortality after hospital 
discharge in CCU survivors.
STUDY DESIGN: This was a retrospective observational study that included 
patients admitted to CCU. All data were extracted from the Medical Information 
Mart for Intensive Care IV database. The exposure was delirium during CCU stay. 
The primary outcome was mortality 180 days after hospital discharge. Secondary 
outcomes included post-hospital discharge mortality at 90 days, length of CCU 
and hospital stays, and hospital discharge disposition.
RESULTS: Of the 3609 CCU patients included, 891 were considered 
delirium-positive during their CCU stay. Delirium was associated with an 
increased risk of mortality at 180 days after hospital discharge (adjusted 
hazard ratio [HR], 1.33; 95% confidence interval (CI), 1.08-1.64). Similar 
results were observed for 90-day post-discharge mortality (adjusted HR,1.43; 95% 
CI, 1.13-1.83). CCU patients who experienced delirium had longer stays in both 
the CCU and hospital (adjusted β, 2.11; 95% CI, 1.79-2.43 and 3.87; 95% CI, 
3.06-4.69, respectively). They were also more likely to require nursing care 
after hospital discharge (adjusted odds ratio [OR], 1.65; 95% CI, 1.22-2.22).
CONCLUSION: Delirium during CCU stay was associated with an increased risk of 
all-cause mortality up to 180 days in CCU patients who survived hospital 
discharge.
RELEVANCE TO CLINICAL PRACTICE: Delirium places CCU patients at a higher risk of 
post-discharge mortality and increased health care resource requirements. Given 
the high prevalence of delirium in CCU patients and its significantly 
deleterious impact on both short-term and long-term post-discharge mortality, 
nurses and physicians should enhance the post-discharge management of patients 
who experience delirium in order to improve prognosis. This also highlights the 
importance of preventing and managing delirium during hospitalization.

BACKGROUND: The triglyceride-glucose (TyG) index was significantly associated 
with insulin resistance (IR). Several studies have validated the effect of TyG 
index on cerebrovascular disease. However, the value of TyG index in patients 
with severe stroke requiring ICU admission remains unclear. The aim of this 
study was to investigate the association between the TyG index and clinical 
prognosis of critically ill patients with ischemic stroke (IS).
METHODS: This study identified patients with severe IS requiring ICU admission 
from the Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care (MIMIC-IV) database, and 
divided them into quartiles based on TyG index level. The outcomes included 
in-hospital mortality and ICU mortality. The association between the TyG index 
and clinical outcomes in critically ill patients with IS was elucidated using 
Cox proportional hazards regression analysis and restricted cubic splines.
RESULTS: A total of 733 patients (55.8% male) were enrolled. The hospital 
mortality and intensive care unit (ICU) mortality reached 19.0% and 14.9%, 
respectively. Multivariate Cox proportional hazards analysis showed that the 
elevated TyG index was significantly related to all-cause death. After 
confounders adjusting, patients with an elevated TyG index had a significant 
association with hospital mortality (adjusted hazard ratio, 1.371; 95% 
confidence interval, 1.053-1.784; P = 0.013) and ICU mortality (adjusted hazard 
ratio, 1.653; 95% confidence interval, 1.244-2.197; P = 0.001). Restricted cubic 
splines revealed that a progressively increasing risk of all-cause mortality was 
related to an elevated TyG index.
CONCLUSION: The TyG index has a significant association with hospital and ICU 
all-cause death in critically ill patients with IS. This finding demonstrates 
that the TyG index might be useful in identifying patients with IS at high risk 
of all-cause death.

OBJECTIVE: To compare the characteristics and outcomes of culture-positive 
sepsis (CPS) with culture-negative sepsis (CNS) patients in order to understand 
the impact of CNS on prognosis and explore the possible risk factors for 
mortality.
METHODS: A retrospective cohort study was conducted. Patients with sepsis were 
identified from the Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care database-IV v0.4 
(MIMIC-IV v0.4). Patients were divided into CPS and CNS groups according to the 
culture results within 24 hours before and after the diagnosis of sepsis. 
General information, baseline characteristics, and medical operation data 
between CNS and CPS groups were compared. Logistic regression analysis was used 
to calculate the relationship between CNS and in-hospital mortality under three 
regression models. Chi-square analysis and mediation analysis were used to 
analyze the effect of initial antibiotic and prior antibiotic use within 90 days 
on the in-hospital mortality of CNS.
RESULTS: A total of 8 587 patients with sepsis were enrolled in the final 
analysis, including 5 483 patients in the CPS group and 3 104 patients in the 
CNS group. Compared with the CPS group, the patients in the CNS group were 
younger [years old: 68 (56, 79) vs. 70 (58, 81)], had higher sequential organ 
failure assessment (SOFA) score and higher proportion of using mechanical 
ventilation, renal replacement therapy and vasopressin within 24 hours after 
intensive care unit (ICU) admission [SOFA score: 3 (2, 5) vs. 3 (2, 4), 
mechanical ventilation: 48.61% (1 509/3 104) vs. 39.25% (2 152/5 483), renal 
replacement therapy: 13.69% (425/3 104) vs. 9.68% (531/5 483), vasopressin: 
15.79% (490/3 104) vs. 13.44% (737/5 483)], longer length of ICU stay [days: 5 
(3, 10) vs. 3 (2, 6)] and higher in-hospital mortality [25.00% (776/3 104) vs. 
18.53% (1 016/5 483)], with significant differences (all P < 0.01). However, 
there was no significant difference in gender, ICU type, simplified acute 
physiology score II (SAPS II), and Charlson comorbidity index (CCI) score 
between the two groups. After adjustment for multiple confounding factors, CNS 
was still a risk factor for in-hospital mortality [odds ratio (OR) = 1.441, 95% 
confidence interval (95%CI) was 1.273-1.630, P < 0.001]. The results of 
Chi-square analysis and mediation analysis showed that the initial antibiotic 
had no significant effect on the higher in-hospital mortality of CNS, while the 
prior use of antibiotics within 90 days was related to higher in-hospital 
mortality of CNS (OR = 1.683, 95%CI was 1.328-2.134, P < 0.05). The mediating 
effect of CNS in prior antibiotic use within 90 days and in-hospital death was 
significant (Z = 5.302, P < 0.001), accounting for 7.58%.
CONCLUSIONS: Compared with CPS, CNS was more severe and had a worse prognosis. 
Prior use of antibiotics within 90 days may be related to the higher in-hospital 
mortality of CNS patients, but it could not fully explain the high mortality of 
CNS.

BACKGROUND: Sepsis is a common cause of mortality in critically ill patients, 
and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is one of the most common 
comorbidities in septic patients. However, the impact of COPD on patients with 
sepsis remained unclear. Therefore, the purpose of this study aimed to assess 
the effect of COPD on the prognosis of septic patients based on Medical 
Information Mart for Intensive Care (MIMIC-III) database.
METHODS: In this retrospective study based on the (MIMIC)-III database version 
1.4 (v1.4), we collected clinical data and 28-day all-cause mortality from 
patients with sepsis in intensive care unit (ICU) and these patients met the 
diagnostic criteria of Sepsis 3 on ICU admission between 2008 and 2012. 
International Classification of Diseases (ICD-9) (4660, 490, 4910, 4911, 49120, 
49121, 4918, 4919, 4920, 4928, 494, 4940, 4941, 496) was used to identified 
COPD. We applied Kaplan-Meier analysis to compare difference of 28-day all-cause 
mortality between septic patients with and without COPD. Cox 
proportional-hazards model was applied to explore the risk factor associated 
with 28-day all-cause mortality in patients with sepsis.
RESULTS: Six thousand two hundred fifty seven patients with sepsis were included 
in this study, including 955 (15.3%) patients with COPD and 5302 patients 
without COPD (84.7%). Compared with patients without COPD, patients with COPD 
were older (median: 73.5 [64.4, 82.0] vs 65.8 [52.9, 79.1], P < 0.001), had 
higher simplified acute physiology score II (SAPSII) (median: 40.0 [33.0, 49.0] 
vs 38.0 [29.0,47.0], P < 0.001) and greater proportion of mechanical ventilatory 
support (MV) (55.0% vs 48.9%, P = 0.001). In our study, septic patients with 
COPD had higher 28-day all-cause mortality (23.6% vs 16.4%, P < 0.001) than 
patients without COPD. After adjusting for covariates, the results showed that 
COPD was an independent risk factor for the 28-day all-cause mortality of 
patients with sepsis (HR 1.30, 95%CI: 1.12-1.50, P = 0.001).
CONCLUSIONS: COPD was an independent risk factor of 28-day all-cause mortality 
in septic patients. Clinically, septic patients with COPD should be given 
additional care.

To investigate the association between blood pressure variability (BPV) and 
mortality (in-hospital and 30-day) among heart failure (HF) patients, and to 
examine these associations across patient subgroups. This multicenter 
retrospective cohort study analyzed 25,591 heart failure patients from two 
intensive care databases (eICU Collaborative Research Database [eICU-CRD] and 
the Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care IV [MIMIC-IV]). BPV was assessed 
using coefficient of variation of systolic (SBPV), diastolic (DBPV), and mean 
(MBPV) blood pressure measurements. Multivariable logistic regression and Cox 
proportional hazards models evaluated mortality associations, adjusting for 
clinical parameters. The observed mortality rates were 14.7% (in-hospital) and 
17.3% (30-day). Higher BPV demonstrated significant associations with increased 
mortality risk, with SBPV showing the strongest relationship. For in-hospital 
mortality, each standard deviation increase in SBPV, DBPV, and MBPV corresponded 
to adjusted odds ratios of 1.56 (95% CI 1.51-1.62), 1.21 (95% CI 1.16-1.25), and 
1.42 (95% CI 1.37-1.48), respectively. For 30-day mortality, adjusted hazard 
ratios were 1.37 (95% CI 1.33-1.41) for SBPV, 1.15 (95% CI 1.12-1.19) for DBPV, 
and 1.30 (95% CI 1.27-1.34) for MBPV. These associations remained robust across 
all patient subgroups. Increased blood pressure variability during 
hospitalization independently predicts higher in-hospital (14.7%) and 30-day 
mortality (17.3%) in HF patients, with SBPV showing the strongest association 
(OR: 1.56, 95% CI 1.51-1.62). BPV may serve as a valuable prognostic marker for 
risk stratification in hospitalized heart failure patients.

BACKGROUND: Acute kidney injury (AKI) can make cases of acute respiratory 
distress syndrome (ARDS) more complex, and the combination of the two can 
significantly worsen the prognosis. Our objective is to utilize machine learning 
(ML) techniques to construct models that can promptly identify the risk of AKI 
in ARDS patients.
METHOD: We obtained data regarding ARDS patients from the Medical Information 
Mart for Intensive Care III (MIMIC-III) and MIMIC-IV databases. Within the 
MIMIC-III dataset, we developed 11 ML prediction models. By evaluating various 
metrics, we visualized the importance of its features using Shapley additive 
explanations (SHAP). We then created a more concise model using fewer variables, 
and optimized it using hyperparameter optimization (HPO). The model was 
validated using the MIMIC-IV dataset.
RESULT: A total of 928 ARDS patients without AKI were included in the analysis 
from the MIMIC-III dataset, and among them, 179 (19.3%) developed AKI after 
admission to the intensive care unit (ICU). In the MIMIC-IV dataset, there were 
653 ARDS patients included in the analysis, and among them, 237 (36.3%) 
developed AKI. A total of 43 features were used to build the model. Among all 
models, eXtreme gradient boosting (XGBoost) performed the best. We used the top 
10 features to build a compact model with an area under the curve (AUC) of 
0.850, which improved to an AUC of 0.865 after the HPO. In extra validation set, 
XGBoost_HPO achieved an AUC of 0.854. The accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, 
positive prediction value (PPV), negative prediction value (NPV), and F1 score 
of the XGBoost_HPO model on the test set are 0.865, 0.813, 0.877, 0.578, 0.957 
and 0.675, respectively. On extra validation set, they are 0.724, 0.789, 0.688, 
0.590, 0.851, and 0.675, respectively.
CONCLUSION: ML algorithms, especially XGBoost, are reliable for predicting AKI 
in ARDS patients. The compact model maintains excellent predictive ability, and 
the web-based calculator improves clinical convenience. This provides valuable 
guidance in identifying AKI in ARDS, leading to improved patient outcomes.

BACKGROUND: The triglyceride glucose (TyG) index, a metric computed from the 
levels of fasting triglyceride (TG) and fasting plasma glucose (FPG), has 
emerged as a simple surrogate measure for insulin resistance (IR) in recent 
years. In multiple critical care scenarios, such as contrast-induced acute 
kidney injury (AKI) and cardiorenal syndrome, a high TyG index levels shows a 
notable correlation with AKI incidence. However, its predictive value for AKI in 
critically ill hypertensive patients remains uncertain.
METHODS: Participants were selected from the Medical Information Mart for 
Intensive Care IV (MIMIC-IV) database and divided into quartiles based on the 
TyG index. The primary focus of the study was to investigate the risk of acute 
kidney injury (AKI), with in-hospital mortality as a secondary endpoint, 
assessed among all study subjects as well as specifically among AKI patients. 
The use of renal replacement therapy (RRT), indicative of AKI progression, was 
also considered a secondary endpoint reflecting renal outcomes. To explore the 
correlation between the TyG index and AKI risk in critically ill hypertensive 
patients, the study employed a restricted cubic splines model and Cox 
proportional hazards (CPH) models. Additionally, Kaplan-Meier survival analysis 
was utilized to assess differences in primary and secondary outcomes across 
groups categorized by their TyG index. Analyses were conducted to ensure the 
consistency of the predictive capability of TyG index across various subgroups.
RESULTS: Our study included 4,418 participants, with 57% being male patients. 
AKI occurred in 56.1% of cases. Through the CPH analysis, we identified a 
significant association between the TyG index and AKI occurrence in critically 
ill hypertensive patients. With the help of a restricted cubic splines model, we 
observed a direct relationship between an elevated TyG index and an increased 
AKI. Subgroup examinations consistently proved the predictive value of the TyG 
index across categories. Furthermore, Kaplan-Meier survival analysis revealed 
notable differences in RRT among AKI patients.
CONCLUSION: The findings underscore the importance of the TyG index as a 
reliable predictor for the occurrence of AKI and adverse renal outcomes among 
hypertensive patients in critical ill states. Nevertheless, validating causality 
mandates extensive prospective investigations.

OBJECTIVE: The association between red blood cell distribution width-to-albumin 
(RDW/ALB) ratio (RAR) and all-cause mortality in patients with acute 
pancreatitis has not been fully delineated. The purpose of this study was to 
investigate the impact of RAR at admission on 28-day all-cause mortality in 
patients with acute pancreatitis.
DESIGN: This investigation was conducted as a retrospective analysis utilizing 
data from the Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care (MIMIC)-III database.
PARTICIPANTS: Patients with acute pancreatitis were selected from the MIMIC-III 
database according to predefined eligibility criteria.
OUTCOME: The outcome was the all-cause mortality rates within 28 days.
RESULTS: Upon screening and excluding ineligible participants, a total of 931 
patients with acute pancreatitis who met the inclusion criteria were analyzed. 
The overall mortality at 28 days was 11.71%. The receiver operating 
characteristic (ROC) analysis indicated that RAR had a moderate predictive value 
for all-cause mortality at 28 days, with an area under the curve (AUC) of 0.669 
(95%CI, 0.617-0.720; p<0.05), and the cutoff value was 4.39. Divide the patients 
into a high RAR group and a low RAR group based on the cutoff value. 
Kaplan-Meier survival analysis demonstrated a statistically significant increase 
in 28-day mortality among patients in the high RAR group compared to those in 
the low RAR group. Multivariate analysis indicated that potassium levels, total 
bilirubin, blood urea nitrogen, lactate, partial thromboplastin time, neutrophil 
and RAR were independently associated with the 28-day mortality. Multivariate 
Cox regression analysis confirmed that an elevated RAR was independently 
associated with increased mortality at 28 day (HR, 2.72; 95% CI, 1.64-4.52; p < 
0.001).
CONCLUSIONS: This study demonstrated that RAR at admission functioned as a 
significant prognostic indicator for mortality in patients with acute 
pancreatitis.

BACKGROUND: The anion gap (AG) has been linked to the prognosis of many 
cardiovascular disorders. However, the correlation between albumin-corrected 
anion gap (ACAG) and 30 d all-cause mortality of intensive care patients with 
acute myocardial infarction (AMI) is unclear. Furthermore, owing to the lack of 
studies, it is also unknown whether ACAG is more accurate than AG in 
predicting the mortality of AMI.
METHODS: The Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care IV (MIMIC IV) 
dataset was used to provide patient data in this retrospective cohort study. 
ACAG is computed using the formulae: [4.4-{albumin (g/dl)}] × 2.5 + AG. The 
primary outcome was 30 d all-cause mortality intensive care patients with AMI. 
To explore the prognostic worthiness of ACAG, the receiver operating 
characteristic curve, smooth curve fitting, Cox regression model, and 
Kaplan survival analysis was performed.
RESULTS: We enrolled 2,160 patients in this study. ACAG had a better predictive 
value for 30 d all-cause mortality than AG, with an area under the curve of 
0.66. The association between ACAG levels and overall mortality was nonlinear. 
In our model, after correcting for confounding factors, the ACAG was the 
independent predictor for 30 d all-cause mortality (HR 1.75, 95%CI 1.24, 2.47). 
ACAG K-M estimator curve analyses revealed that the group with 
ACAG ≥ 21.75 mmol/l had poor survival rate than the other group.
CONCLUSIONS: High serum ACAG levels were a significant risk factor for 30 d 
all-cause mortality in critically ill patients with AMI. ACAG concentration and 
30 d all-cause mortality had a nonlinear relationship. ACAG had better 
predictive value in identifying 30 d all-cause mortality of patients with AMI in 
ICU than the AG.

BACKGROUND: This study aims to investigate the clinical outcome between 
high-flow nasal cannula (HFNC) and non-invasive ventilation (NIV) therapy in 
mild to moderate hypoxemic patients on the first ICU day and to develop a 
predictive model of 48-h intubation.
METHODS: The study included adult patients from the MIMIC III and IV databases 
who first initiated HFNC or NIV therapy due to mild to moderate hypoxemia 
(100 < PaO2/FiO2 ≤ 300). The 48-h and 30-day intubation rates were compared 
using cross-sectional and survival analysis. Nine machine learning and six 
ensemble algorithms were deployed to construct the 48-h intubation predictive 
models, of which the optimal model was determined by its prediction accuracy. 
The top 10 risk and protective factors were identified using the Shapley 
interpretation algorithm.
RESULT: A total of 123,042 patients were screened, of which, 673 were from the 
MIMIC IV database for ventilation therapy comparison (HFNC n = 363, NIV n = 310) 
and 48-h intubation predictive model construction (training dataset n = 471, 
internal validation set n = 202) and 408 were from the MIMIC III database for 
external validation. The NIV group had a lower intubation rate (23.1% vs. 16.1%, 
p = 0.001), ICU 28-day mortality (18.5% vs. 11.6%, p = 0.014), and in-hospital 
mortality (19.6% vs. 11.9%, p = 0.007) compared to the HFNC group. Survival 
analysis showed that the total and 48-h intubation rates were not significantly 
different. The ensemble AdaBoost decision tree model (internal and external 
validation set AUROC 0.878, 0.726) had the best predictive accuracy performance. 
The model Shapley algorithm showed Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (SOFA), 
acute physiology scores (APSIII), the minimum and maximum lactate value as risk 
factors for early failure and age, the maximum PaCO2 and PH value, Glasgow Coma 
Scale (GCS), the minimum PaO2/FiO2 ratio, and PaO2 value as protective factors.
CONCLUSION: NIV was associated with lower intubation rate and ICU 28-day and 
in-hospital mortality. Further survival analysis reinforced that the effect of 
NIV on the intubation rate might partly be attributed to the other impact 
factors. The ensemble AdaBoost decision tree model may assist clinicians in 
making clinical decisions, and early organ function support to improve patients' 
SOFA, APSIII, GCS, PaCO2, PaO2, PH, PaO2/FiO2 ratio, and lactate values can 
reduce the early failure rate and improve patient prognosis.

OBJECTIVE: The lactate/albumin ratio (LAR) has been used as a novel prognostic 
indicator for aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage, traumatic brain injury, 
sepsis, heart failure, and acute respiratory failure. However, its potential in 
predicting all-cause mortality in patients with ischemic stroke (IS) has not 
been evaluated. Therefore, this study aimed to elucidate the correlation between 
LAR and 28-day all-cause mortality in IS patients without reperfusion therapy.
METHODS: This retrospective cohort study used data from the Medical Information 
Mart for Intensive Care (MIMIC-IV) (v2.0) database. It included 568 IS adult 
patients admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU). The correlation between LAR 
and ICU 28-day all-cause mortality rate was analyzed using multiple COX 
regression analysis and Kaplan-Meier survival analysis. Restricted cubic spline 
(RCS) curves were used to assess the relationship between LAR and 28-day 
mortality. In addition, a subgroup analysis was performed to investigate the 
impact of other influencing factors on outcomes. The primary outcome was the 
ability of LAR to predict 28-day mortality in IS patients.
RESULTS: Among the 568 patients with IS, 370 survived (survival group) and 198 
died (non-survival group) within 28 days of admission (mortality rate: 34.9%). A 
multivariate COX regression analysis indicated that LAR was an independent 
predictor of all-cause mortality within 28 days after admission for patients 
with IS (hazard ratio: 1.32; 95% confidence interval: 1.03-1.68; P = 0.025). We 
constructed a model that included LAR, age, race, sex, white blood cell count, 
Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (SOFA) score, and anion gap (AG) and 
established a prediction model with an area under the curve (AUC) value of 71.5% 
(95% confidence interval: 67.1%-75.8%). The optimal cutoff value of LAR that 
separated the survival group and the non-survival group based on the Youden 
index was 0.55. The Kaplan-Meier survival curves plotted using this critical 
value showed that patients with LAR ≥ 0.55 had a significantly higher 28-day 
all-cause mortality rate than patients with LAR < 0.55 (P = 0.0083).
CONCLUSION: LAR can serve as an independent predictor of all-cause mortality 
within 28 days after admission for patients with IS.

BACKGROUND: The prognostic value of in-hospital hemoglobin drop in non-overt 
bleeding patients with acute myocardial infarction (AMI) admitted to the 
intensive care unit (ICU) remains insufficiently investigated.
METHODS: A retrospective analysis was performed based on the Medical Information 
Mart for Intensive Care (MIMIC)-IV database. 2,334 ICU-admitted non-overt 
bleeders diagnosed with AMI were included. In-hospital hemoglobin values 
(baseline value on admission and nadir value during hospitalization) were 
available. Hemoglobin drop was defined as a positive difference between 
admission and in-hospital nadir hemoglobin. The primary endpoint was 180-day 
all-cause mortality. The time-dependent Cox proportional hazard models were 
structured to analyze the connection between hemoglobin drop and mortality.
RESULTS: 2,063 patients (88.39%) experienced hemoglobin drop during 
hospitalization. We categorized patients based on the degree of hemoglobin drop: 
no hemoglobin drop (n = 271), minimal hemoglobin drop (< 3 g/dl; n = 1661), 
minor hemoglobin drop (≥ 3 g/dl & < 5 g/dl, n = 284) and major hemoglobin drop 
(≥ 5 g/dl; n = 118). Minor (adjusted hazard ratio [HR] = 12.68; 95% confidence 
interval [CI]: 5.13-31.33; P < 0.001) and major (adjusted HR = 13.87; 95% CI: 
4.50-42.76; P < 0.001) hemoglobin drops were independently associated with 
increased 180-day mortality. After adjusting the baseline hemoglobin level, a 
robust nonlinear relationship was observed in the association between hemoglobin 
drop and 180-day mortality, with 1.34 g/dl as the lowest value (HR = 1.04; 95% 
CI: 1.00-1.08).
CONCLUSION: In non-overt bleeding ICU-admitted patients with AMI, in-hospital 
hemoglobin drop is independently associated with higher 180-day all-cause 
mortality.

Background: Sepsis-associated encephalopathy (SAE) is a dysfunction of the 
central nervous system experienced during sepsis with variable clinical and 
pathophysiologic features. We sought to identify distinct SAE phenotypes in 
relation to clinical outcomes. Methods: The Medical Information Mart for 
Intensive Care IV (MIMIC-IV) database and the eICU database were used to conduct 
a retrospective cohort study. Adult sepsis patients were included and SAE was 
defined as having a Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) score ˂15 or delirium. The 
following our clinical phenotypes were defined as: ischemic-hypoxic, metabolic, 
mixed (ischemic-hypoxic and metabolic), and unclassified. The primary outcome 
was in-hospital mortality. Results: The study enrolled 4,120 sepsis patients, 
2,239 from MIMIC-IV (including 1,489 patients with SAE, 67%), and 1,881 from 
eICU (1,291, 69%). For the SAE cohort, 2,780 patients in total were enrolled 
(median age, 67 years; interquartile range, 56-76.8; 1,589 (57%) were male; 
median GCS score was 12 [8-14]; median Sequential Organ Failure Assessment score 
was 6 [4-9]). The SAE phenotype distributions between the MIMIC-IV and eICU 
cohorts were as follows (39% vs. 35% ischemic-hypoxic, P = 0.043; 38% vs. 40% 
metabolic, P = 0.239; 15% vs. 15% mixed, P = 0.972; 38% vs. 40% unclassified, P 
= 0.471). For the overall cohort, the in-hospital mortality for patients with 
ischemic-hypoxic, metabolic, mixed, or unclassified phenotypes was 33.9% (95% 
confidence interval, 0.3-0.37), 28.4% (0.26-0.31), 41.5% (0.37-0.46), and 14.2% 
(0.12-0.16), respectively. In the multivariable logistic analysis, the mixed 
phenotype was associated with the highest risk of in-hospital mortality after 
adjusting for age, sex, GCS, and modified Sequential Organ Failure Assessment 
score (adjusted odds ratio, 2.11; 95% confidence interval, 1.67-2.67; P < 
0.001). Conclusions: Four SAE phenotypes had different clinical outcomes. The 
mixed phenotype had the worst outcomes. Further understanding of these 
phenotypes in sepsis may improve trial design and targeted SAE management.

BACKGROUND: Dialysis or non-dialysis end-stage renal disease (ESRD) patients are 
accompanied by cardiovascular disease (CVD) or hypertension. We aimed to study 
the effect of a common treatment for CVD, β-blockers, on the survival of ESRD 
patients, improving their prognosis from the perspective of drug therapy.
METHODS: It was a retrospective cohort study using the Medical Information Mart 
for Intensive Care dataset. ESRD patients in the intensive care unit from June 
2001 to October 2012 were included. We examined the effect of using versus not 
using β-blockers in the overall population and subgroups with the risk of 28-day 
and 3-year mortality through Cox proportional hazards models and Kaplan-Meier 
curves.
RESULTS: A total of 1639 participants were included with 371 (22.64%) β-blockers 
users. There were 315 (19.22%) 28-day and 970 (59.18%) 3-year mortality events 
during follow-up. Using β-blockers in overall ESRD patients could reduce 
all-cause 28-day mortality [adjusted hazard ratio (HR) 0.450, 95% confidence 
interval (CI) 0.325-0.624] and 3-year mortality (adjusted HR 0.695, 95% CI 
0.589-0.821). This result was consistent among subgroups (ESRD without 
hypertension: adjusted HR 0.412, 95% CI 0.289-0.588; with CVD: adjusted HR 
0.478, 95% CI 0.321-0.711; without CVD: adjusted HR 0.448, 95% CI 0.248-0.810; 
with dialysis: adjusted HR 0.471, 95% CI 0.320-0.694) in 28-day mortality, and 
the 3-year mortality was consistent. In ESRD patients with hypertension and 
without dialysis subgroups, β-blockers had no effect on survival.
CONCLUSION: Using β-blockers could reduce the risk of 28-day and 3-year 
mortality in ESRD patients, including those with CVD. This study provided a 
reference for the treatment of β-blockers in patients with ESRD.

BACKGROUND: Inflammation plays a critical role in acute myocardial infarction 
(AMI). Recent studies have shown the value of hematologic indicators in MI risk 
stratification and prognostic assessment. However, the association between 
lymphocyte-to-monocyte ratio (LMR) and the long-term mortality of critically ill 
MI patients remains unclear.
METHODS: Clinical data were extracted from the Medical Information Mart for 
Intensive Care III database. Patients diagnosed with AMI on admission in the 
intensive care units were include. The optimal cutoff value of LMR was 
determined by X-tile software. The Cox proportional hazard model was applied for 
the identification of independent prognostic factors of 1-year mortality and 
survival curves were estimated using the Kaplan-Meier method. In order to reduce 
selection bias, a 1:1 propensity score matching (PSM) method was performed.
RESULTS: A total of 1517 AMI patients were included in this study. The cutoff 
value for 1-year mortality of LMR determined by X-Tile software was 3.00. A 
total of 534 pairs of patients were matched after PSM. Multivariate analysis 
(HR = 1.369, 95%CI 1.110-1.687, P = 0.003) and PSM subgroups (HR = 1.299, 95%CI 
1.032-1.634, P = 0.026) showed that 1-year mortality was significantly higher in 
patients with LMR < 3.00 than patients with LMR ≥ 3.00 in Cox proportional 
hazard models. The survival curves showed that patients with LMR < 3.00 had a 
significantly lower 1-year survival rate before (63.83 vs. 81.03%, Log rank 
P < 0.001) and after PSM (68.13 vs. 74.22%, Log rank P = 0.041).
CONCLUSION: In this retrospective cohort analysis, we demonstrated that a low 
admission LMR (< 3.00) was associated with a higher risk of 1-year mortality in 
critically ill patients with AMI.

Mortality and differential predictive factors of transient and persistent 
sepsis-associated acute kidney injury.

Xia W, Yi F, Wang Q.

BACKGROUND: The clinical outcomes and differential predictive factors for 
transient and persistent sepsis-associated AKI (SA-AKI) currently remain 
unclear. Therefore, using a large international database, this study aimed to 
compare the in-hospital mortality outcomes and determine the clinical factors 
for differentiating transient and persistent SA-AKI.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: Patients with SA-AKI were identified from the Medical 
Information Mart for Intensive Care IV (MIMIC IV) database and divided into a 
persistent SA-AKI group and a transient SA-AKI group. In-hospital mortality 
rates between the two groups were compared. Logistic regression was performed to 
explore the risk factors, with the establishment of a clinical predictive model 
for transient or persistent SA-AKI.
RESULTS: Mortality rate of the persistent SA-AKI group was higher than of the 
transient SA-AKI group (p < 0.001). Persistent SA-AKI was an independent risk 
factor for in-hospital mortality. Factors including creatinine level at 
inclusion (OR 1.49, 95% CI 1.43 - 1.56, p < 0.001), changes of creatinine level 
(mg/dL) within 24 hours (OR 4.25, 95% CI 3.74 - 4.86, p < 0.001), continuous 
renal replacement therapy (CRRT) performed within 48 hours (OR 4.20, 95% CI 
2.87 - 6.17), lactate level (mmol/L) (OR 1.18, 95% CI 1.05 - 1.12, p < 0.001) 
were independent risk factors for persistent SA-AKI. When incorporating these 
factors, the predictive model for persistent SA-AKI demonstrated good C-indexes 
of 0.80 (95% CI: 0.80 - 0.82) and 0.81 (95% CI: 0.79 - 0.83) in the training and 
validation cohorts, respectively, though the goodness-of-fit was poor.
CONCLUSION: Persistent SA-AKI has a higher risk of in-hospital mortality than 
transient SA-AKI, whereby persistent SA-AKI is also an independent predictor of 
in-hospital mortality. The nomogram established by predictive factors can be 
applied in clinical practice to predict persistent SA-AKI.

OBJECTIVE: The management of cardiogenic shock (CS) in the elderly remains a 
major clinical challenge. Existing clinical prediction models have not performed 
well in assessing the prognosis of elderly patients with CS. This study aims to 
build a predictive model, which could better predict the 30-day mortality of 
elderly patients with CS.
METHODS: We extracted data from the Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care 
III version 1.4 (MIMIC-III) as the training set and the data of validation sets 
were collected from the Second Affiliated Hospital and Yuying Children's 
Hospital of Wenzhou Medical University. Three models, including the cox 
regression model, the Least Absolute Shrinkage and Selection Operator (LASSO) 
regression model, and the CoxBoost model, were established using the training 
set. Through the comparison of area under the receiver operating characteristic 
(ROC) curve (AUC), C index, net reclassification improvement (NRI), integrated 
discrimination improvement (IDI), and median improvement in risk score, the best 
model was selected. Then for external validation, compared the best model with 
the simplified acute physiology score II (SAPSII) and the CardShock risk score.
RESULTS: A total of 919 patients were included in the study, of which 804 
patients were in the training set and 115 patients were in the verification set. 
Using the training set, we built three models: the cox regression model 
including 6 predictors, the LASSO regression model including 4 predictors, and 
the CoxBoost model including 16 predictors. Among them, the CoxBoost model had 
good discrimination [AUC: 0.730; C index: 0.6958 (0.6657, 0.7259)]. Compared 
with the CoxBoost model, the NRI, IDI, and median improvement in risk score of 
other models were all<0. In the validation set, the CoxBoost model was also 
well-discriminated [AUC: 0.770; C index: 0.7713 (0.6751, 0.8675)]. Compared with 
the CoxBoost model, the NRI, IDI, and median improvement in risk score of SAPS 
II and the CardShock risk score were all < 0. And we constructed a dynamic 
nomogram to visually display the model.
CONCLUSION: In conclusion, this study showed that in predicting the 30-day 
mortality of elderly CS patients, the CoxBoost model was superior to the Cox 
regression model, LASSO regression model, SAPS II, and the CardShock risk score.

AIM: Sepsis-associated encephalopathy (SAE) is a common and serious complication 
of sepsis with poor prognosis. Statin was used in SAE patients, whereas its 
effects on these patients remain unknown. This study is aimed at investigating 
the impact of statins on the 30-day mortality of patients with SAE.
METHODS: In this retrospective cohort study, data from SAE patients were 
extracted from the Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care IV (MIMIC-IV). 
Statins include atorvastatin, pravastatin, rosuvastatin, and simvastatin. The 
outcome was 30-day mortality of SAE patients starting 24 h after the first 
intensive care unit (ICU) admission and at the first time after hospitalization. 
Potential covariates (sociodemographic characteristics, vital signs, score 
indexes, laboratory parameters, comorbidities, and treatment intervention 
methods) were selected using univariate Cox proportional hazard analysis. 
Associations between statin use and statin type and 30-day mortality were 
explored using univariate and multivariate Cox proportional hazard models with 
hazard ratios (HRs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs). Associations were 
further explored in different age groups, sex, sequential organ failure 
assessment (SOFA), simplified acute physiology score II (SAPS II), and systemic 
inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS) populations.
RESULTS: A total of 2,729 SAE patients were included in the study, and 786 
(28.8%) died within 30 days. Statin use was associated with lower odds of 30-day 
mortality (HR = 0.77, 95%CI: 0.66-0.90) in all SAE patients. Patients who took 
simvastatin treatments were associated with lower odds of 30-day mortality 
(HR = 0.58, 95%CI: 0.43-0.78). Rosuvastatin treatments had a higher 30-day 
mortality risk (HR = 1.88, 95%CI: 1.29-2.75). Statin use was also associated 
with lower 30-day mortality among patients of different ages, sex, sequential 
organ failure assessment (SOFA), SAPS II, and SIRS.
CONCLUSION: Patients who were treated with simvastatin were associated with 
lower odds of 30-day mortality in SAE patients. Caution should be paid to statin 
use in SAE patients, particularly in patients treated with rosuvastatin or 
pravastatin.

BACKGROUND: New-onset atrial fibrillation (NOAF) is associated with worse 
short-term prognosis among critically ill patients, and the benefit of 
anticoagulation is uncertain.
OBJECTIVE: We aimed to evaluate whether anticoagulation at hospital discharge 
for critically ill patients presenting with NOAF is associated with improved 
survival.
METHODS: Retrospective Cohort Study using the Medical Information Mart for 
Intensive Care (MIMIC)-IV database, which comprises data from patients admitted 
to the intensive care units (ICUs) at Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center, 
Boston, Massachusetts, USA. We included patients diagnosed with NOAF during 
admission to ICUs between 2008 and 2019 and excluded patients with pre-existing 
atrial fibrillation (AF), admission related to cardiac surgery and previous 
anticoagulant use. We did a propensity-score matched (PSM) 1:1 to compare 
survival between patients discharged on anticoagulation (ACO) vs no 
anticoagulation and a Cox regression model to assess the primary outcome of 
long-term survival post-hospital discharge. We censored the patients at 3 
different time points and performed another 3-sensitivity analysis to assess the 
robustness of the results.
RESULTS: A total of 495 patients received ACO therapy, and 2021 patients did 
not. Matching demonstrated adequate covariate balance, with both groups 
comprising 495 patients postmatching. Out of hospital mortality rate after PSM 
was 30.9% vs 38.4% in the ACO and non-ACO groups, respectively. Patients in the 
ACO group exhibited greater long-term survival (hazard ratio [HR] 0.72, 95% CI 
0.58-0.89, P = .003). The benefit was present in the PSM analysis censored at 90 
days (HR 0.63, 95% CI 0.43-0.94, P = .02), 1 year (HR 0.55, 95% CI 0.41-0.793, P 
< .001), and 5 years (HR 0.7, 95% CI 0.56-0.88, P = .002).These findings also 
remained consistent across the 3 other sensitivity analyses performed.
CONCLUSION: Anticoagulant prescription at hospital discharge for patients with 
NOAF during ICU stay was associated with longer survival.

OBJECTIVE: To develop and evaluate a nomogram prediction model for the 3-month 
mortality risk of patients with sepsis-associated acute kidney injury (S-AKI).
METHODS: Based on the American Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care- IV 
(MIMIC- IV), clinical data of S-AKI patients from 2008 to 2021 were collected. 
Initially, 58 relevant predictive factors were included, with all-cause 
mortality within 3 months as the outcome event. The data were divided into 
training and testing sets at a 7 : 3 ratio. In the training set, univariate 
Logistic regression analysis was used for preliminary variable screening. 
Multicollinearity analysis, Lasso regression, and random forest algorithm were 
employed for variable selection, combined with the clinical application value of 
variables, to establish a multivariable Logistic regression model, visualized 
using a nomogram. In the testing set, the predictive value of the model was 
evaluated through internal validation. The receiver operator characteristic 
curve (ROC curve) was drawn, and the area under the curve (AUC) was calculated 
to evaluate the discrimination of nomogram model and Oxford acute severity of 
illness score (OASIS), sequential organ failure assessment (SOFA), and systemic 
inflammatory response syndrome score (SIRS). The calibration curve was used to 
evaluate the calibration, and decision curve analysis (DCA) was performed to 
assess the net benefit at different probability thresholds.
RESULTS: Based on the survival status at 3 months after diagnosis, patients were 
divided into 7 768 (68.54%) survivors and 3 566 (31.46%) death. In the training 
set, after multiple screenings, 7 variables were finally included in the 
nomogram model: Logistic organ dysfunction system (LODS), Charlson comorbidity 
index, urine output, international normalized ratio (INR), respiratory support 
mode, blood urea nitrogen, and age. Internal validation in the testing set 
showed that the AUC of nomogram model was 0.81 [95% confidence interval (95%CI) 
was 0.80-0.82], higher than the OASIS score's 0.70 (95%CI was 0.69-0.71) and 
significantly higher than the SOFA score's 0.57 (95%CI was 0.56-0.58) and SIRS 
score's 0.56 (95%CI was 0.55-0.57), indicating good discrimination. The 
calibration curve demonstrated that the nomogram model's calibration was better 
than the OASIS, SOFA, and SIRS scores. The DCA curve suggested that the nomogram 
model's clinical net benefit was better than the OASIS, SOFA, and SIRS scores at 
different probability thresholds.
CONCLUSIONS: A nomogram prediction model for the 3-month mortality risk of S-AKI 
patients, based on clinical big data from MIMIC- IV and including seven 
variables, demonstrates good discriminative ability and calibration, providing 
an effective new tool for assessing the prognosis of S-AKI patients.

BACKGROUND: Acetaminophen (APAP) is widely used in the treatment of patients 
after surgery, but the prognosis of patients with coronary artery bypass 
grafting (CABG)-related acute respiratory distress syndrome (CABG-ARDS) is still 
unclear. This study aims to explore the role of APAP in the management of CABG 
related ARDS.
METHODS: We collected clinical data on patients with CABG-ARDS from the Medical 
Information Mart for Intensive Care-IV (MIMIC-IV) database. The primary outcome 
was early mortality after ARDS, and the secondary outcomes were length of 
hospital stay and duration of mechanical ventilation (MV). Multivariate logistic 
regression and Cox regression models were used for statistical analysis, and 
inverse probability processing weighting (IPTW), overlap weighting (OW) and 
propensity score matching (PSM) were used to explore the robustness of the 
outcomes.
RESULTS: A total of 5459 patients were enrolled in the analysis. Multivariate 
logistic regression analysis revealed that the 14-day mortality in APAP group 
was significantly lower than that in non-APAP group (0.5% vs. 2.7%, OR = 0.301; 
95% CI, 0.170-0.531; P < 0.001). The APAP group also showed a significant 
advantage in Cox regression analysis (0.5% vs. 2.7%, HR = 0.329; 95% CI, 
0.187-0.577; P < 0.001). IPTW, OW, and PSM analyses were conducted between the 
two groups, and the differences remained significant. These results were 
consistent in 30-, 60-, and 90-day mortality analyses. Meanwhile, exposure to 
APAP was associated with a shorter length of hospital stay and a reduced 
duration of MV (P < 0.001).
CONCLUSION: The administration of APAP was associated with reduced early 
mortality in patients with CABG-ARDS, as well as shorter length of hospital stay 
and duration of MV.

BACKGROUND: The triglyceride-glucose (TyG) index, renowned for its efficacy and 
convenience in assessing insulin resistance, has been validated as a reliable 
indicator for various cardiovascular conditions. The current study aims for 
clarifying the link of TyG with the incidences and prognoses of cardiac arrest 
(CA) following acute myocardial infarction (AMI).
METHODS: Our analysis is a multicenter, retrospective study utilizing data from 
the Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care IV and the eICU Collaborative 
Research Database. Patients with AMI for whom TyG could be calculated within the 
first 24 h after admission were included. The main endpoints were in-hospital 
and ICU mortalities. Correlations between TyG and outcomes were evaluated using 
logistic regression models, restricted cubic splines (RCS), as well as 
correlation and linear analyses. Overlap weighting (OW), inverse probability of 
treatment weighting (IPTW), and propensity score matching (PSM) methodologies 
were utilized to balance the cohorts, thereby minimizing potential biases. 
Subgroup analyses were performed in accordance with identified modifiers.
RESULTS: In total, 5208 individuals diagnosed with AMI, among whom 371 developed 
CA, were ultimately included. Higher TyG levels were observed among AMI 
populations with CA compared to those without [9.2 (8.7-9.7) vs. 9.0 (8.5-9.4)], 
and TyG demonstrated a moderate discriminatory capacity for identifying CA 
occurrences within entire AMI populations. Multivariate logistic regressions 
revealed TyG serves a significant risk indicator for both in-hospital (OR 1.711) 
and ICU mortalities (OR 1.520) in AMI-CA patients, and it is also associated 
with prolonged LOSs. RCS analyses confirmed linear relationships of ascending 
TyG with increased mortality risks for AMI-CA (P for nonlinearity: 0.592 and 
0.816, respectively), which persisted following PSM, OW, and IPTW adjustments. 
Subgroup analyses further identified a strong link of the TyG with mortality 
rates among elders, females, individuals with BMI < 28 kg/m2, and those with 
hypertension.
CONCLUSIONS: Elevated TyG levels were found to apparently correlate with higher 
prevalence and adverse outcomes regarding CA in patients with AMI. Our findings 
point a fresh insight into the significance of the TyG in critically ill 
coronary conditions.

BACKGROUND: The pathophysiological characteristics of the respiratory system of 
obese patients differ from those of non-obese patients. Few studies have 
evaluated the effects of high-flow nasal cannula (HFNC) and non-invasive 
ventilation (NIV) on the prognosis of obese patients. We here compared the 
effects of these two techniques on the prevention of reintubation after 
extubation for obese patients.
METHODS: Data were extracted from the Medical Information Mart for Intensive 
Care database. Patients who underwent HFNC or NIV treatment after extubation 
were assigned to the HFNC or NIV group, respectively. The reintubation risk 
within 96 hours postextubation was compared between the two groups using a 
doubly robust estimation method. Propensity score matching was performed for 
both groups.
RESULTS: This study included 757 patients (HFNC group: n=282; NIV group: n=475). 
There was no significant difference in the risk of reintubation within 96 hours 
after extubation for the HFNC group compared with the NIV group (OR 1.50, 
p=0.127). Among patients with body mass index ≥40 kg/m2, the HFNC group had a 
significantly lower risk of reintubation within 96 hours after extubation (OR 
0.06, p=0.016). No significant differences were found in reintubation rates 
within 48 hours (15.6% vs 11.0%, p=0.314) and 72 hours (16.9% vs 13.0%, 
p=0.424), as well as in hospital mortality (3.2% vs 5.2%, p=0.571) and intensive 
care unit (ICU) mortality (1.3% vs 5.2%, p=0.108) between the two groups. 
However, the HFNC group had significantly longer hospital stays (14 days vs 
9 days, p=0.005) and ICU (7 days vs 5 days, p=0.001) stays.
CONCLUSIONS: This study suggests that HFNC therapy is not inferior to NIV in 
preventing reintubation in obese patients and appears to be advantageous in 
severely obese patients. However, HFNC is associated with significantly longer 
hospital stays and ICU stays.

BACKGROUND/AIMS: Acute kidney injury (AKI) in critically ill patients is common, 
and continuous renal replacement therapy (CRRT) is a preferred mode of renal 
replacement therapy (RRT) in hemodynamically unstable patients. Prediction of 
clinical outcomes in patients on CRRT is challenging. We utilized several 
approaches to predict RRT-free survival (RRTFS) in critically ill patients with 
AKI requiring CRRT.
METHODS: We used the Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care (MIMIC-III) 
database to identify patients ≥18 years old with AKI on CRRT, after excluding 
patients who had ESRD on chronic dialysis, and kidney transplantation. We 
defined RRTFS as patients who were discharged alive and did not require RRT ≥7 
days prior to hospital discharge. We utilized all available biomedical data up 
to CRRT initiation. We evaluated 7 approaches, including logistic regression 
(LR), random forest (RF), support vector machine (SVM), adaptive boosting 
(AdaBoost), extreme gradient boosting (XGBoost), multilayer perceptron (MLP), 
and MLP with long short-term memory (MLP + LSTM). We evaluated model performance 
by using area under the receiver operating characteristic (AUROC) curves.
RESULTS: Out of 684 patients with AKI on CRRT, 205 (30%) patients had RRTFS. The 
median age of patients was 63 years and their median Simplified Acute Physiology 
Score (SAPS) II was 67 (interquartile range 52-84). The MLP + LSTM showed the 
highest AUROC (95% CI) of 0.70 (0.67-0.73), followed by MLP 0.59 (0.54-0.64), LR 
0.57 (0.52-0.62), SVM 0.51 (0.46-0.56), AdaBoost 0.51 (0.46-0.55), RF 0.44 
(0.39-0.48), and XGBoost 0.43 (CI 0.38-0.47).
CONCLUSIONS: A MLP + LSTM model outperformed other approaches for predicting 
RRTFS. Performance could be further improved by incorporating other data types.

BACKGROUND: The TyG-BMI index, which is a reliable indicator of insulin 
resistance (IR), has been found to have a significant correlation with the 
occurrence of cardiovascular events. However, there still lacks study on the 
TyG-BMI index and prognosis in patients with atrial fibrillation (AF). The 
objective of the present study was to evaluate the relationship between TyG-BMI 
index at admission to ICU and all-cause mortality in critically ill patients 
with AF.
METHODS: The patient's data were extracted from Medical Information Mart for 
Intensive Care IV(MIMIC-IV) database. All patients were divided into four groups 
according to TyG-BMI index. Outcomes include primary and secondary endpoints, 
with the primary endpoint being the 30-day and 365-day all-cause mortality and 
the secondary endpoint being the 90-day and 180-day all-cause mortality. TyG-BMI 
index was quartile and Kaplan-Meier curve was used to compare the outcome of 
each group. Cox proportional-hazards regression model and restricted cubic 
splines (RCS) were conducted to assess the relationship between TyG-BMI index 
and outcomes.
RESULTS: Out of a total of 2509 participants, the average age was 73.26 ± 11.87 
years, with 1555 (62.0%) being males. Patients with lower level of TyG-BMI had 
higher risk of 30-day, 90-day, 180-day and 365-day all-cause mortality, 
according to the Kaplan-Meier curves (log-rank P < 0.001). In addition, cox 
proportional-hazards regression analysis revealed that the risk of 30-day, 
90-day, 180-day and 365-day all-cause mortality was significantly higher in the 
lowest quartile of TyG-BMI. Meanwhile, the RCS analysis indicated that L-typed 
relationships between TyG-BMI index and all-cause mortality, with inflection 
points at 223.60 for 30-day and 255.02 for 365-day all-cause mortality, 
respectively. Compared to patients with TyG-BMI levels below the inflection 
points, those with higher levels had a 1.8% lower risk for 30-day all-cause 
mortality (hazard ratio [HR] 0.982, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.9676-0.988) 
and 1.1% lower risk for 365-day all-cause mortality (HR 0.989, 95% CI 
0.986-0.991).
CONCLUSION: In critically ill patients with AF, a lower TyG-BMI level is 
significantly associated with a higher risk of 30-day, 90-day, 180-day and 
365-day all-cause mortality. TyG-BMI index could be used as a valid indicator 
for grading and treating patients with AF in the ICU.

BACKGROUND: Inflammation plays a critical role in the development of acute 
kidney injury (AKI). Neutrophil-lymphocyte ratio (NLR) is a biomarker of 
systemic inflammation used to predict the prognostic outcome of several 
diseases. We conducted a retrospective cohort study to investigate if NLR can be 
used as a biomarker to predict the mortality of AKI.
METHODS AND RESULTS: Records of critically ill patients with AKI were extracted 
from the Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care Database III version 1.3 
(MIMIC-III v1.3). The primary outcome was 30-day mortality and the two secondary 
outcomes were in hospital and 90-day mortality. We used the Cox proportional 
hazards models to assess the association between different categories of NLR and 
outcomes. This analysis included data for 13,678 eligible subjects, with a total 
of 2,588 30-day, 2,224 in-hospital and 3,545 90-day deaths during the follow-up 
period. For 30-day mortality, an increased risk of mortality was associated with 
a higher level of NLR. The HR (95% confidence interval [CI]) of upper tertile 
(NLR > 12.14) was 1.37 (1.17-1.60) in a multivariate model when compared with 
that of the lower tertile (NLR < 5.55). In the quintile analysis, we confirmed 
the upward trend with HR (95% CI) of the fifth quintile (NLR > 17.4) of 1.35 
(1.08, 1.69) in a multivariate model compared to the first quintile 
(NLR < 3.82). A similar tendency was observed for 90-day mortality. In the 
analysis of in-hospital mortality, the HR of fifth quintile (NLR > 17.4) showed 
a slight decrease.
CONCLUSIONS: Our analysis indicates that a higher level of NLR is associated 
with increased risk of 30-day and 90-day mortality in AKI patients. The similar 
upward trend is not detected in analysis of in-hospital mortality.

BACKGROUND: The role of the triglyceride-glucose (TyG) index in critically ill 
patients with congestive heart failure (CHF) and atrial fibrillation (AF), 
requiring intensive care unit (ICU) admission, remains unclear. This study aimed 
to investigate the association between the TyG index and the clinical prognosis 
of critically ill patients with CHF and AF.
METHODS: This retrospective observational cohort study utilized data from the 
Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care-IV (MIMIC IV2.2) database. 
Participants were categorized into four groups based on TyG index level. The 
primary outcome was hospital all-cause mortality. Multivariable logistic 
proportional regression analysis and restricted cubic spline regression were 
employed to assess the TyG index's association with hospital mortality in 
patients with CHF and AF. Sensitivity analysis included determining the TyG 
index's feature importance through subgroup analysis in different subgroups.
RESULTS: A total of 787 patients were included in the study, with hospital and 
ICU mortalities of 14.2% and 8.3%, respectively. Multivariate logistic 
regression analysis demonstrated that the TyG index was independently associated 
with an increased risk of hospital mortality (odds ratio (OR), 1.59 [95% 
confidence interval (CI) 1.15-2.19], P = 0.005) and ICU mortality [OR 1.9; (95% 
CI 1.28-2.83), P = 0.001] after adjusting for confounders. The restricted cubic 
spline regression model indicated a linear increase in the risks of in-hospital 
and ICU mortality with a higher TyG index. Sensitivity analysis revealed 
consistent effect sizes and directions in different subgroups, ensuring result 
stability.
CONCLUSIONS: The results of our study suggest a significant association between 
the TyG index and hospital and ICU all-cause mortality in critically ill 
patients with CHF and AF. This finding implies that the TyG index could 
potentially serve as a valuable tool for identifying patients with CHF and AF at 
an elevated risk of all-cause mortality.

BACKGROUNDS: Decreased urine output (UO) is associated with adverse outcomes in 
certain patients, but this effect in patients admitted for cardiovascular 
diseases is still unproven. Moreover, the relationship between increased UO and 
prognosis is also unclear.
OBJECTIVE: To investigate the relationship between decreased or increased UO and 
outcomes in patients with the cardiovascular intensive care unit (CICU).
METHODS: This study was a retrospective cohort analysis based on the medical 
information mart for intensive care III (MIMIC-III) database. The patients' data 
were extracted from the Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center (Boston, MA) 
between 2001 and 2012. With the initial 24-h UO range from 0.5 to 1.0 ml/kg/h as 
the reference, participants were divided into the several groups. The primary 
outcome was 30-day mortality. The secondary outcomes were 90-day mortality, ICU 
mortality, hospital mortality, use of mechanical ventilation (MV), and 
vasopressor agents in the first 24-h of ICU. The association between UO and 
mortality was assessed by multivariable logistic regression.
RESULTS: A total of 13,279 patients admitted to CICU were included. Low UO (< 
0.5 ml/kg/h) was strongly associated with 30-day mortality (unadjusted OR = 
3.993, 95% CI: 3.447-4.625, p < 0.001), and very high UO (≥ 2.0 ml/kg/h) was 
also a significantly risk factor for 30-day mortality (Unadjusted OR = 2.069, 
95% CI: 1.701-2.516, p < 0.001) compared with the reference. The same effects 
also were shown in the multivariable logistic regression, adjusted by age, 
gender, vital signs, common comorbidities, and use of diuretics, with an 
adjusted OR of 2.023 (95% CI: 1.693-2.417, p < 0.001) for low UO and 1.771 (95% 
CI: 1.389-2.256, p < 0.001) for very high UO. Moreover, both decreased UO and 
increased UO were risk factors for 90-day mortality, ICU mortality, hospital 
mortality, use of MV and vasopressor agents.
CONCLUSION: The decreased and increased UO both were significantly associated 
with short-term mortality, the relationship between UO and mortality was U-shape 
rather than linear.

BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Sepsis-associated AKI is a heterogeneous clinical 
entity. We aimed to agnostically identify sepsis-associated AKI subphenotypes 
using deep learning on routinely collected data in electronic health records.
DESIGN, SETTING, PARTICIPANTS, & MEASUREMENTS: We used the Medical Information 
Mart for Intensive Care III database, which consists of electronic health record 
data from intensive care units in a tertiary care hospital in the United States. 
We included patients ≥18 years with sepsis who developed AKI within 48 hours of 
intensive care unit admission. We then used deep learning to utilize all 
available vital signs, laboratory measurements, and comorbidities to identify 
subphenotypes. Outcomes were mortality 28 days after AKI and dialysis 
requirement.
RESULTS: We identified 4001 patients with sepsis-associated AKI. We utilized 
2546 combined features for K-means clustering, identifying three subphenotypes. 
Subphenotype 1 had 1443 patients, and subphenotype 2 had 1898 patients, whereas 
subphenotype 3 had 660 patients. Subphenotype 1 had the lowest proportion of 
liver disease and lowest Simplified Acute Physiology Score II scores compared 
with subphenotypes 2 and 3. The proportions of patients with CKD were similar 
between subphenotypes 1 and 3 (15%) but highest in subphenotype 2 (21%). 
Subphenotype 1 had lower median bilirubin levels, aspartate aminotransferase, 
and alanine aminotransferase compared with subphenotypes 2 and 3. Patients in 
subphenotype 1 also had lower median lactate, lactate dehydrogenase, and white 
blood cell count than patients in subphenotypes 2 and 3. Subphenotype 1 also had 
lower creatinine and BUN than subphenotypes 2 and 3. Dialysis requirement was 
lowest in subphenotype 1 (4% versus 7% [subphenotype 2] versus 26% [subphenotype 
3]). The mortality 28 days after AKI was lowest in subphenotype 1 (23% versus 
35% [subphenotype 2] versus 49% [subphenotype 3]). After adjustment, the 
adjusted odds ratio for mortality for subphenotype 3, with subphenotype 1 as a 
reference, was 1.9 (95% confidence interval, 1.5 to 2.4).
CONCLUSIONS: Utilizing routinely collected laboratory variables, vital signs, 
and comorbidities, we were able to identify three distinct subphenotypes of 
sepsis-associated AKI with differing outcomes.

BACKGROUND: The atherogenic index of plasma (AIP) is considered an important 
marker of atherosclerosis and cardiovascular risk. However, its potential role 
in predicting length of stay (LOS), especially in patients with atherosclerotic 
cardiovascular disease (ASCVD), remains to be explored. We investigated the 
effect of AIP on hospital LOS in critically ill ASCVD patients and explored the 
risk factors affecting LOS in conjunction with machine learning.
METHODS: Using data from the Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care 
(MIMIC)-IV. AIP was calculated as the logarithmic ratio of TG to HDL-C, and 
patients were stratified into four groups based on AIP values. We investigated 
the association between AIP and two key clinical outcomes: ICU LOS and total 
hospital LOS. Multivariate logistic regression models were used to evaluate 
these associations, while restricted cubic spline (RCS) regressions assessed 
potential nonlinear relationships. Additionally, machine learning (ML) 
techniques, including logistic regression (LR), decision tree (DT), random 
forest (RF), extreme gradient boosting (XGB), and light gradient boosting 
machine (LGB), were applied, with the Shapley additive explanation (SHAP) method 
used to determine feature importance.
RESULTS: The study enrolled a total of 2423 patients with critically ill ASCVD, 
predominantly male (54.91%), and revealed that higher AIP values were 
independently associated with longer ICU and hospital stays. Specifically, for 
each unit increase in AIP, the odds of prolonged ICU and hospital stays were 
significantly higher, with adjusted odds ratios (OR) of 1.42 (95% CI, 1.11-1.81; 
P = 0.006) and 1.73 (95% CI, 1.34-2.24; P < 0.001), respectively. The RCS 
regression demonstrated a linear relationship between increasing AIP and both 
ICU LOS and hospital LOS. ML models, specifically LGB (ROC:0.740) and LR 
(ROC:0.832) demonstrated superior predictive accuracy for these endpoints, 
identifying AIP as a vital component of hospitalization duration.
CONCLUSION: AIP is a significant predictor of ICU and hospital LOS in patients 
with critically ill ASCVD. AIP could serve as an early prognostic tool for 
guiding clinical decision-making and managing patient outcomes.

BACKGROUND: Sepsis-associated encephalopathy (SAE) is related to increased 
short-term mortality in patients with sepsis. We aim to establish a 
user-friendly nomogram for individual prediction of 30-day risk of mortality in 
patients with SAE.
METHODS: Data were retrospectively retrieved from the Medical Information Mart 
for Intensive Care (MIMIC III) open source clinical database. SAE was defined by 
Glasgow Coma Score (GCS) < 15 or delirium at the presence of sepsis. Prediction 
model with a nomogram was constructed in the training set by logistic regression 
analysis and then undergone internal validation and sensitivity analysis.
RESULTS: SAE accounted for about 50% in patients with sepsis and was 
independently associated with the 30-day mortality of sepsis. Variables eligible 
for the nomogram included patient's age and clinical parameters on the first day 
of ICU admission including the GCS score, lactate, bilirubin, red blood cell 
distribution width (RDW), mean value of respiratory rate and temperature, and 
the use of vasopressor. Compared with Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (SOFA) 
and Logistic Organ Dysfunction System (LODS), the nomogram exhibited better 
discrimination with an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve 
(AUROC) of 0.763 (95%CI 0.736-0.791, p < 0.001) and 0.753 (95%CI 0.713-0.794, p 
< 0.001) in the training and validation sets, respectively. The calibration plot 
revealed an adequate fit of the nomogram for predicting the risk of 30-day 
mortality in both sets. Regarding to clinical usefulness, the DCA of the 
nomogram exhibited greater net benefit than SOFA and LODS in both of the 
training and validation sets. Besides, the nomogram exhibited acceptable 
discrimination, calibration, and clinical usefulness in sensitivity analysis.
CONCLUSIONS: SAE is related to increased 30-day mortality of patients with 
sepsis. The nomogram presents excellent performance in predicting 30-day risk of 
mortality in SAE patients, which can be used to evaluate the prognosis of 
patients with SAE and may be more beneficial once specific treatments towards 
SAE are developed.

BACKGROUND: Serum anion gap (AG) has been proven to be associated with prognosis 
in critically ill patients. However, few studies have investigated the 
association between AG and all-cause mortality in critically ill patients with 
chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD).
OBJECTIVE: We hypothesized that the initial AG level would predict the mortality 
risk in critically ill patients with COPD.
METHODS: This retrospective cohort study was based on the Medical Information 
Mart for Intensive Care (MIMIC) IV database. We extracted demographics, vital 
signs, laboratory tests, comorbidity, and scoring systems from the first 24 
hours after patient ICU admission. Multivariable logistic regression analysis 
models were used to explore the association between serum AG levels and 
mortality. Interaction and stratified analyses were conducted including age, 
gender and comorbidity.
RESULTS: A total of 5531 critically ill patients with COPD were enrolled, 
composed of 53.6% male and 46.4% female with a median age of 73 years. The 
all-cause mortality of these patients during ICU hospitalization was 13.7%. The 
risk of all-cause mortality increased as the AG level increased in the 
univariate logistic regression analysis (OR=1.13, 95% CI: 1.11-1.15, p<0.01). 
After adjusting for all the covariates in multivariate logistic regression 
analysis, the odds ratio was 1.06 (95% CI: 1.04-1.09, p<0.01). Compared with the 
lowest AG group Q1 (≤11mmol/L), the adjusted OR value for AG and mortality in Q2 
(12-13mmol/L) was 0.89 (95% CI: 0.63-1.25, p=0.502), Q3 (14-15mmol/L) was 0.95 
(95% CI: 0.68-1.34, p=0.788), and Q4 (≥16mmol/L) was 1.49 (95% CI: 1.10-2.02, 
p=0.009) respectively. In addition, the results of the subgroup and stratified 
analyses were robust.
CONCLUSION: AG is positively related to all-cause mortality in critically ill 
patients with COPD.

In critically ill patients with acute myocardial infarction (AMI), the 
relationship between the early administration of β-blockers and the risks of 
in-hospital and long-term mortality remains controversial. Furthermore, there 
are conflicting evidences for the efficacy of the early administration of 
intravenous followed by oral β-blockers in AMI. We conducted a retrospective 
analysis of critically ill patients with AMI who received the early 
administration of β-blockers within 24 hours of admission. The data were 
extracted from the Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care IV database. We 
enrolled 2467 critically ill patients with AMI in the study, with 1355 patients 
who received the early administration of β-blockers and 1112 patients who were 
non-users. Kaplan-Meier survival analysis and Cox proportional hazards models 
showed that the early administration of β-blockers was associated with a lower 
risk of in-hospital mortality (adjusted hazard ratio [aHR] 0.52; 95% confidence 
interval [95%CI] 0.42-0.64), 1-year mortality (aHR 0.54, 95%CI 0.47-0.63), and 
5-year mortality (aHR 0.60, 95%CI 0.52-0.69). Furthermore, the early 
administration of both oral β-blockers and intravenous β-blockers followed by 
oral β-blockers may reduce the mortality risk, compared with non-users. The 
risks of in-hospital and long-term mortality were significantly decreased in 
patients who underwent revascularization with the early administration of 
β-blockers. We found that the early administration of β-blockers could lower the 
risks of in-hospital and long-term mortality. Furthermore, the early 
administration of both oral β-blockers and intravenous β-blockers followed by 
oral β-blockers may reduce the mortality risk, compared with non-users. Notably, 
patients who underwent revascularization with the early administration of 
β-blockers showed the lowest risks of in-hospital and long-term mortality.

BACKGROUND: Acute respiratory failure (ARF) is a common disease in the intensive 
care units (ICUs) with high risk of mortality. The red cell distribution width 
(RDW) is one of baseline ICU indicators which can be easily available, and has 
been used in the long-term prognostic analyses of diseases. However, no studies 
have explored the role of baseline RDW and its change during hospitalization in 
in-hospital mortality in ARF. Herein, this study aims to explore the association 
between RDW and its changes and the 30-day mortality in ARF patients.
METHODS: Demographic and clinical data of 7,497 patients with ARF were extracted 
from the Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care IV (MIMIC-IV) database in 
2012-2019 in this retrospective cohort study. Univariable and multivariable Cox 
regression analyses were used to explore the association between RDW and its 
changes and 30-day mortality with hazard ratios (HRs) and 95% confidence 
intervals (CIs). Subgroup analyses of different baseline RDW levels were also 
performed. We then assessed the predictive performance of RDW changes combined 
with the Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (SOFA) score on 30-day mortality 
using receiver operator characteristic curves (ROCs) with areas under curve 
(AUCs).
RESULTS: Totally, 2,254 (30.07%) patients died in 30 days. After adjusting for 
covariates, we found that high baseline RDW [HR = 1.25, 95%CI: (1.15-1.37)] and 
RDW changes ≥0.3% [HR = 1.12, 95%CI: (1.01-1.24)] were both related to an 
increased risk of 30-day mortality. In patients whose baseline RDW level ≥14.9%, 
RDW changes ≥0.3% was also associated with an increased risk of 30-day mortality 
[HR = 1.19, 95%CI: (1.05-1.35)]. Moreover, the predictive value of RDW changes 
combined with SOFA on 30-day mortality was a little better than that of single 
SOFA score, with AUCs of 0.624 vs. 0.620.
CONCLUSION: High baseline RDW level and its changes during hospitalization was 
relate to the increased risk of 30-day mortality in ARF, and the predictive 
value of RDW changes for ARF short-term mortality is still needed exploration.

Background: Two previous studies have shown that increased neutrophil to 
lymphocyte ratio (NLR) is associated with short-term prognosis in patients with 
acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), but it is usually assessed as a 
single threshold value at baseline. We investigated the relationship between the 
baseline and the early change in NLR and 30-day mortality in patients with ARDS 
to evaluate the prognostic value of NLR baseline and NLR changes during the 
first 7 days after ICU admission. Methods: This is a retrospective cohort study, 
with all ARDS patients diagnosed according to the Berlin definition from the 
Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care III (MIMIC-III) database. We 
calculated the NLR by dividing the neutrophil count by the lymphocyte count. The 
multivariable logistic regression analysis was used to investigate the 
relationship between the baseline NLR and short-term mortality. Then the 
generalized additive mixed model was used to compare trends in NLR over time 
among survivors and non-survivors after adjusting for potential confounders. 
Results: A total of 1164 patients were enrolled in our study. Multivariable 
logistic regression analysis showed that after adjusting for confounders, 
elevated baseline NLR was a significant risk factor predicting 30-day mortality 
(OR 1.02, 95%CI 1.01, 1.03, P = 0.0046) and hospital mortality (OR 1.02, 95%CI 
1.01, 1.03, P = 0.0003). The result of the generalized additive mixed model 
showed that the NLR decreased in the survival group and increased in the 
non-survival group gradually within 7 days after ICU admission. The difference 
between the two groups showed a trend of increase gradually and the difference 
increased by an average of 0.67 daily after adjusting for confounders. 
Conclusions: We confirmed that there was a positive correlation between baseline

changes over time between the non-survival group and the survival group. The 
early increase in NLR was associated with short-term mortality in ARDS patients.

Serum lactate has been used as a prognostic indicator in intensive care unit 
patients, and however, the single lactate value may not be enough to reflect 
changes during illness conditions. Herein, this study aims to explore the 
association between serum lactate and lactate clearance rate and 30-day 
mortality in patients undergoing mechanical ventilation (MV). Demographic and 
clinical data of 2628 adults were extracted from the medical information mart 
for intensive care-III clinical database in this retrospective cohort study. The 
lactate clearance rate was calculated using the serum lactate at the beginning 
of MV (T0), and serum lactate at the12 hours after MV beginning (T1). Univariate 
and multivariate Cox regression analyses were used to screen covariates, and 
explore the association between serum lactate and lactate clearance rate and 
30-day mortality. We also explored these associations in different T0 serum 
lactate level subgroups. The evaluation indexes were hazard ratios (HRs) and 95% 
CIs. In addition, receiver operator characteristic (ROC) curve with area under 
the curve (AUC) was used to reflect the predictive performance of serum lactate 
and lactate clearance rate on 30-day mortality. A total of 827 (31.47%) 
mechanically ventilated patients died within 30 days. After adjusting for 
covariates, elevated T0 (HR = 1.04, 95%CI: [1.02-1.07]) and T1 (HR = 1.07, 
95%CI: [1.04-1.10]) serum lactate was both associated with an increased risk of 
30-day mortality, while higher lactate clearance rate was negatively associated 
with the risk of 30-day mortality (HR = 0.64, 95%CI: [0.50-0.81]). Among 
patients with T0 lactate ≥2 mmol/L, T1 serum lactate ≥4 mmol/L was associated 
with an increased risk of 30-day mortality, while lactate clearance rate ≥50 was 
associated with a decreased risk (all P < .05). Moreover, T1 serum lactate had a 
potential predictive value on 30-day mortality with an AUC of 0.605. Serum 
lactate and lactate clearance rate were both associated with 30-day mortality in 
patients undergoing MV. Our results may provide some references for further 
studies to explore the roles of serum lactate and lactate clearance rate in 
prognoses of critical patients.

OBJECTIVES: The ratio of ferritin to albumin (FAR) has been proposed as a novel 
prognostic indicator for COVID-19. However, the role of FAR in predicting the 
all-cause mortality rate in patients with sepsis has not been evaluated. 
Therefore, the aim of this study is to elucidate the correlation between FAR and 
the 28-day all-cause mortality rate in patients with sepsis.
METHODS: This study used data from the Medical Information Mart for Intensive 
Care IV database (v2.0) for a retrospective cohort analysis. The study focused 
on adult patients with sepsis who were admitted to the intensive care unit. The 
primary objective was to assess the predictive capability of FAR in determining 
the 28-day all-cause mortality rate among patients with sepsis.
RESULTS: The study involved 1553 sepsis patients in total. Based on the survival 
status of sepsis patients within 28 days, they were divided into two groups: a 
survival group consisting of 973 patients, and a death group consisting of 580 
patients. The results revealed a 28-day mortality rate of 37.35% among sepsis 
patients. The multivariable Cox regression analysis revealed that FAR was an 
independent predictor of the 28-day all-cause mortality rate in patients with 
sepsis (hazard ratio [HR]: 1.17-1.19; 95% confidence interval 1.11-1.26; 
P < 0.001). The FAR demonstrated a higher area under the curve (AUC) of 61.01% 
(95% confidence interval 58.07-63.96%), compared to serum ferritin (60.48%), 
serum albumin (55.56%), and SOFA score (56.97%). Receiver operating 
characteristic curve (ROC) analysis determined the optimal cutoff value for FAR 
as 364.2215. Kaplan-Meier analysis revealed a significant difference in the 
28-day all-cause mortality rate between patients with FAR ≥ 364.2215 and those 
with FAR < 364.2215 (P < 0.001). Furthermore, subgroup analysis showed no 
significant interaction between FAR and each subgroup.
CONCLUSIONS: This study revealed a significant correlation between FAR and the 
28-day mortality rate in patients with sepsis. Higher FAR values were strongly 
associated with increased mortality rates within 28 days.

Cerebral hemorrhage is a major cause of mortality and disability. This study 
investigates the association between glycemic variability (GV) and short- and 
long-term clinical outcomes such as poor outcomes at discharge, mortality at 90 
days and 1 year and intensive care unit (ICU) /hospital length of stay (LOS) in 
ICU patients with critically ill cerebral hemorrhage. This retrospective 
analysis examined 732 ICU patients with non-traumatic cerebral hemorrhage from 
the Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care (MIMIC)-IV database. GV was 
quantified as the ratio of standard deviation to mean glucose during ICU stay. 
To assess associations between GV and clinical outcomes (poor outcomes at 
discharge, 90-day and 1-year mortality, ICU/hospital LOS), the study employed 
logistic regression, Cox proportional hazards models, and linear regression. 
Additionally, non-linear relationships were explored through restricted cubic 
spline analysis. The investigation further incorporated subgroup and sensitivity 
analyses to ensure robustness of findings. To evaluate the incremental 
predictive value of GV, the study utilized receiver operating characteristic 
(ROC) curve analysis, net reclassification improvement, and integrated 
discrimination improvement, thereby providing a comprehensive assessment of GV's 
clinical utility. Higher GV was significantly associated with increased risk of 
poor outcomes at discharge and 90-day and 1-year mortality in both patient 
groups. GV showed a linear association with poor outcomes at discharge but a 
non-linear association with 90-day and 1-year mortality. GV thresholds of ≥ 0.11 
for non-traumatic cerebral hemorrhage increased mortality risks. Cohort showed 
non-linear relationships between GV and ICU/hospital LOS. GV's impact was 
stronger in non-hypertensive and male patients. Adding GV to existing severity 
scores improved their predictive ability for adverse outcomes. In patients with 
non-traumatic cerebral hemorrhage admitted to the ICU, GV demonstrates an 
independent association with poor outcomes over both short-term and long-term 
time horizons. Furthermore, GV is associated with extended durations of both ICU 
and overall hospital stays in this patient population. These findings underscore 
the importance of glycemic control in this patient population and suggest that 
GV could be a valuable prognostic indicator and potential therapeutic target.

OBJECTIVE: Dexmedetomidine has demonstrated potential in preclinical medical 
research as a protective agent against inflammatory injuries and a provider of 
neuroprotective benefits. However, its effect on the short-term prognosis of 
patients with sepsis-associated encephalopathy remains unclear. This study aims 
to explore the underlying value of dexmedetomidine in these patients.
PATIENTS AND METHODS: This study enrolled patients with sepsis-associated 
encephalopathy from the Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care (MIMIC)-IV 
database, and they were divided into two groups based on dexmedetomidine therapy 
during hospitalization. Propensity score matching (PSM) and inverse probability 
of treatment weighting (IPTW) were utilized to balance the inter-group baseline 
differences. Kaplan-Meier (KM) curves with log-rank test and subgroup analysis 
were also employed. The primary outcome was 28-day mortality, and the secondary 
outcomes were in-hospital mortality, intensive care unit (ICU) stay time, 
hospital stay time, and the incidence of ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP).
RESULTS: After PSM, 1,075 pairs of patients were matched. In contrast to the 
non-dexmedetomidine cohort, the dexmedetomidine cohort did not exhibit a 
shortened ICU [4.65 (3.16, 8.55) vs. 6.14 (3.66, 11.04), p<0.001] and hospital 
stay duration [10.04 (6.55, 15.93) vs. 12.76 (7.92, 19.95), p<0.001], and there 
was an elevated incidence of VAP [90 (8.4%) vs. 135 (12.6%), p=0.002]. The 
log-rank test for the KM curves of dexmedetomidine use and 28-day mortality was 
statistically significant (p<0.001). The results showed that dexmedetomidine was 
associated with improved 28-day mortality [hazard ratio (HR) 0.46, 95% 
confidence interval (CI) 0.35-0.61, p<0.001] and in-hospital mortality (HR 0.50, 
95% CI 0.37-0.67, p<0.001) after adjusting for various confounders. In the 
following subgroup analysis, dexmedetomidine infusion was associated with 
decreased 28-day mortality in most subgroups.
CONCLUSIONS: Dexmedetomidine administration was significantly associated with 
reduced short-term mortality among patients with sepsis-associated 
encephalopathy in the ICU. However, it also prolonged ICU and hospital stays and 
increased the incidence of VAP.

PURPOSE: Elevated central venous pressure (CVP) plays an important role in the 
occurrence of acute kidney injury (AKI) and it is also independently associated 
with the prognosis of critically ill patients. However, the effect of CVP on 
critically ill AKI patients remains unclear. In this study, we analyzed the 
relationship between CVP and all-cause mortality of critically ill patients with 
AKI.
PATIENTS AND METHODS: The clinical data of patients in intensive care unit (ICU) 
were retrieved from the Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care III 
(MIMIC-III) database and retrospectively analyzed. The all-cause mortality for 
up to 90 days was the main observed outcome. We used the minimum CVP value 
obtained during the first 72 hours after ICU admission for our analysis and 
patients were grouped according to this parameter. Patients were also analyzed 
after being further divided according to stages 1, 2 and 3 of AKI. Multiple Cox 
regression and Kaplan-Meier analyses were used to explore the association 
between CVP measurements and death of ICU patients with AKI.
RESULTS: A total of 1986 ICU patients with AKI were studied. A total of 527 
(26.5%) patients died by day 90. The high CVP group (patients with ≥10 mmHg) had 
the lowest 90-day survival rate (P =0.001 by log rank test) when according to 
Kaplan-Meier analysis. By using Cox regression analysis, high CVP was found to 
be linked to an increase in mortality (CVP ≥10 mmHg versus ≤5 mmHg, HR, 1.336, 
95% CI, 1.064 to 1.677, P trend=0.014). Furthermore, when using in a 
multivariate Cox regression analysis with CVP as a continuous variable, the 
higher CVP levels were still an independent risk factor for 90-day all-cause 
mortality (per 1 mmHg increase, HR, 1.031, 95% CI, 1.013-1.049, P=0.001). In 
subgroup analysis, a similar trend was observed in patients with AKI stages 2 
and 3.
CONCLUSION: The minimum CVP level during the first 72h after ICU admission was 
positively associated with mortality in critically ill patients with AKI and 
this more marked in cases with severe AKI.

The Braden Scale (BS) is a routine nursing measure used to predict the risk of 
pressure ulcer events; recent studies suggest its use as a tool for identifying 
frailty. However, it remains unclear whether the BS holds prognostic value for 
patients with severe non-traumatic subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH). In this 
retrospective study, participants from the Medical Information Mart for 
Intensive Care (MIMIC-IV) database were categorized into two groups based on 
their Braden Scale (BS) scores: the high-risk group (BS ≤ 15) and the low-risk 
group (BS > 15). The primary outcome was all-cause mortality at 3 months. A Cox 
proportional hazards model was constructed to examine the association between BS 
and all-cause mortality in critically ill patients with non-traumatic 
subarachnoid hemorrhage. A restricted cubic spline model was employed to assess 
the relationship between BS and outcomes. A total of 750 patients were included 
in the study, with 43% being male. The mortality rates at 1 month, 3 months, and 
1 year were 21%, 25%, and 29%, respectively. Multivariable Cox proportional 
hazards analysis revealed that the Braden Scale (BS) was independently 
associated with the risk of death at 1 month (HR, 2.84 [1.26-2.81], P=0.002 ), 3 
months (HR, 2.84 [1.73-4.66], P<  0.001), and 1 year (HR, 1.65 [1.15-2.38], 
P = 0.006). The restricted cubic spline regression model showed that the risk of 
death at 3 months increased linearly with decreasing BS scores. The BS is 
significantly associated with all-cause mortality in critically ill patients 
with non-traumatic SAH. This finding suggests that the BS may be useful in 
identifying non-traumatic SAH patients at higher risk of all-cause mortality.

BACKGROUND: The association between the hemoglobin-to-red cell distribution 
width ratio (HRR) and mortality in critically ill patients with heart failure 
(HF) and acute kidney injury (AKI) remains uncertain. This research focuses on 
exploring the association between HRR and both short-term and long-term 
all-cause mortality in these patients.
METHODS: Participants were selected from the Medical Information Mart for 
Intensive Care IV (MIMIC-IV) database and categorized into tertiles based on HRR 
values. The primary endpoint was 28-days ICU all-cause mortality. Secondary 
endpoints included 28-days hospital and 90-days hospital all-cause mortality. 
Cox proportional hazards models and restricted cubic splines were used to 
analyze the association between HRR and mortality in patients with HF and AKI. 
Kaplan-Meier survival analysis estimated endpoint differences across tertiles.
RESULTS: A total of 7561 patients were included, with 55.5% being male (n=4199). 
Cox proportional hazards analysis showed a significant link between HRR and both 
short-term and long-term mortality in critically ill patients with HF and AKI. 
This association remained significant after adjusting for confounders. The 
restricted cubic splines model demonstrated a linear relationship between a 
higher HRR index and a reduced mortality risk. Kaplan-Meier survival analysis 
revealed significant differences in short-term and long-term mortality among the 
tertile groups.
CONCLUSION: The study results show a strong association between lower HRR and 
increased short-term and long-term mortality in critically ill patients with 
heart failure and AKI. HRR proves to be a valuable and cost-effective marker for 
identifying high-risk patients.

BACKGROUND: Sepsis is a life-threatening condition characterized by a 
dysregulated host immune response to infection. Currently, stress hyperglycemia 
is frequently associated with an unfavorable prognosis in cardiovascular and 
cerebrovascular disease. During sepsis, the progression of the immune response 
and inflammation often leads to aberrant metabolic indicators. However, the 
association between the stress-induced hyperglycemia ratio (SHR) and sepsis in 
patients admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) remains uncertain.
OBJECTIVES: This study aimed to explore the potential correlation between SHR 
and sepsis.
MATERIAL AND METHODS: In this retrospective cohort study, data were obtained 
from the Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care-IV (MIMIC-IV) database. 
Patients with recorded glucose and glycosylated HbA1c levels within 24-h ICU 
admission were identified. The endpoints of the follow-up period were the 
occurrence of sepsis during ICU stay or ICU discharge. After adjustment for 
factors including demographics, vital signs and biochemical indicators, the 
univariate and multivariate logistic regression model was employed to examine 
the relationship between SHR, baseline blood glucose levels and the risk of 
sepsis. The associations were further explored in subgroups based on age, gender 
and presence/absence of type 2 diabetes.
RESULTS: Of the total 2,161 patients, with the average age of 64.96 ±16.84 
years, 205 (9.49%) had sepsis. After adjustment or confounders, high SHR levels 
were associated with the risk of sepsis odds ratio (OR) = 1.53, 95% confidence 
interval (95% CI): 1.07-2.17). Similar results were found in patients aged ≥65 
years (OR = 1.91, 95% CI: 1.16-3.17), in men (OR = 1.64, 95% CI: 1.02-2.63) and 
patients without type 2 diabetes history (OR = 1.58, 95% CI: 1.01-2.48). The 
baseline blood glucose level did not exhibit a significant association with the 
risk of sepsis.
CONCLUSIONS: Elevated SHR levels were correlated with sepsis. Bedside monitoring 
of SHR may be a valuable tool for clinicians to identify patients at high risk 
of sepsis, and be beneficial to promptly implement clinical interventions.

BACKGROUND: Acute myocardial infarction (AMI) is mainly caused by a mismatch of 
blood oxygen supply and demand in the myocardium. However, several studies have 
suggested that excessively high or low arterial oxygen tension could have 
deleterious effects on the prognosis of AMI patients. Therefore, the 
relationship between blood oxygenation and clinical outcomes among AMI patients 
is unclear, and could be nonlinear. In the critical care setting, blood oxygen 
level is commonly measured continuously using pulse oximetry-derived oxygen 
saturation (SpO2). The present study aimed to determine the association between 
admission SpO2 levels and all-cause in-hospital mortality, and to elucidate the 
optimal SpO2 range with real-world data.
METHODS: Patients diagnosed with AMI on admission in the Medical Information 
Mart for Intensive Care III (MIMIC-III) database were included. A generalized 
additive model (GAM) with loess smoothing functions was used to determine and 
visualize the nonlinear relationship between admission SpO2 levels within the 
first 24 hours after ICU admission and mortality. Moreover, the Cox regression 
model was constructed to confirm the association between SpO2 and mortality.
RESULTS: We included 1,846 patients who fulfilled our inclusion criteria, among 
whom 587 (31.80%) died during hospitalization. The GAM showed that the 
relationship between admission SpO2 levels and all-cause in-hospital mortality 
among AMI patients was nonlinear, as a U-shaped curve was observed. In addition, 
the lowest mortality was observed for an SpO2 range of 94-96%. Adjusted 
multivariable Cox regression analysis confirmed that the admission SpO2 level of 
94-96% was independently associated with decreased mortality compared to SpO2 
levels <94% [hazard ratio (HR) 1.352; 95% confidence interval (CI): 1.048-1.715; 
P=0.028] and >96% (HR 1.315; 95% CI: 1.018-1.658; P=0.030).
CONCLUSIONS: The relationship between admission SpO2 levels and all-cause 
in-hospital mortality followed a U-shaped curve among patients with AMI. The 
optimal oxygen saturation range was identified as an SpO2 range of 94-96%, which 
was independently associated with increased survival in a large and 
heterogeneous cohort of AMI patients.

BACKGROUND: The kidney is one of the most vulnerable organs in sepsis patients, 
which mainly manifests as sepsis-associated acute kidney injury (SA-AKI). The 
case fatality rate of SA-AKI is high, and thus, predicting the risk of 
SA-AKI-related death is hugely significant. Anion gap (AG) is an important 
indicator in critical illness patients. The present study aimed to analyze the 
predictive value of the AG for the short-term prognosis of SA-AKI patients.
METHODS: SA-AKI patient data from the Medical Information Mart for Intensive 
Care (MIMIC-IV) database were collected retrospectively. Hospitalized septic 
patients who meet the inclusion criteria were included in the final analysis. 
All laboratory test parameters only included the data generated within the first 
24 hours after the patient entered the intensive care unit (ICU) and the extreme 
value. Univariate and multivariate logistic regression analyses were performed 
to analyze the risk factors related to the death of SA-AKI patients within 28 
days during hospitalization in the ICU.
RESULTS: A total of 3,684 SA-AKI patients were included, including 3,305 
patients with low AG (<18 mmol/L) and 379 patients with high AG (≥18 mmol/L). 
Among these patients, 497 cases (13.5%) died during hospitalization, including 
376 cases (11.4%) in the low AG group and 121 cases (31.9%) in the high AG 
group. Multivariate logistic regression analysis showed that elevated AG 
increased the risk of death in SA-AKI patients within 28 days during 
hospitalization in the ICU (odds ratio =1.2, 95% confidence interval: 1.2-1.3). 
Further analysis showed that the risk of death of SA-AKI patients within 28 days 
during hospitalization in the ICU was increased when AG ≥14 mmol/L. The 
relationship between AG level and the risk of death of SA-AKI patients during 
hospitalization was S-shaped.
CONCLUSIONS: In clinical practice, AG levels can serve as a valuable predictor 
of the death risk of SA-AKI patients during hospitalization.

BACKGROUND: This study investigated the association between vasoactive 
medication exposure and mortality risk in patients with sepsis using the 
norepinephrine equivalent (NEE) score and vasoactive-inotropic score (VIS).
METHODS: This retrospective cohort study included adult patients with sepsis 
requiring vasoactive agents. The data were extracted from the Medical 
Information Mart for Intensive Care IV database. The primary outcome was 28-day 
mortality. Multivariate Cox regression was used to elucidate the relationship 
between vasoactive medication exposure and 28-day mortality, as quantified by 
the VIS and NEE score. Hazard ratios with 95% confidence intervals (CI) for 
28-day mortality were generated, and forest plots were constructed to present 
the results of univariate and multivariate analyses. The Kaplan-Meier method was 
used to analyze the cumulative incidence of 28-day mortality. A nomogram was 
constructed to predict the prognosis of patients with sepsis.
RESULTS: The present study encompassed 9,032 patients diagnosed with sepsis who 
received vasoactive therapy, of which 4,229 patients were further analyzed at 
the second hour after the onset of sepsis. Distinct variations in demographic 
data were observed between survivors (n = 3,265, 77.21%) and non-survivors 
(n = 964, 22.79%). Multivariate analysis indicated that several factors, 
including VIS >15.04 (p = 0.001), NEE >0.10 (p < 0.001), heart rate (p = 0.045), 
mean arterial pressure (p = 0.009), respiratory rate (p < 0.001), oxygen 
saturation (p < 0.001), blood urea nitrogen (BUN) (p = 0.001), and the Acute 
Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation II (p < 0.001), were significantly 
associated with 28-day mortality in the patients with sepsis. The NEE score, 
respiratory rate, oxygen saturation, and BUN were incorporated into the nomogram 
model with a concordance index of 0.779 and an area under the curve of 0.802 
(95% CI 0.787-0.818).
CONCLUSION: We found that the VIS and NEE score had favorable values for 
predicting mortality risk in patients with sepsis in the intensive care units. 
The VIS and NEE score in the second hour after sepsis onset were independently 
associated with 28-day mortality in patients with sepsis.

BACKGROUND: The neutrophil-lymphocyte ratio (NLR) has been recognized as a 
useful marker of poor prognosis in non-cardiac surgery patients. But, the 
prognostic function of NLR in cardiovascular surgery patients still largely 
unknown. The aim of this study was to explore the relationship between 
postoperative NLR and mortality in cardiac surgery patients.
METHODS: Clinical data were extracted from the Medical Information Mart for 
Intensive Care III (MIMIC-III) database. Postoperative day 1 (POD-1) NLR of the 
patients was calculated. All patients were divided into two groups according to 
the cut-off value of NLR, which was determined using the receiver operating 
characteristic (ROC) curve and Youden Index. The primary death outcomes were 
30-day, 90-day and 1-year mortality. Cox proportional hazard analysis was 
performed to assess the associations between NLR and 1-year mortality. Logistic 
analysis was performed to assess the associations between NLR and other 
outcomes. Multivariate analyses were used to control for confounders.
RESULTS: A total of 2,707 cardiac surgery patients were included in this study. 
The cut-off value of postoperative NLR was 7.28. Elevated postoperative NLR was 
associated with increased death outcomes including 30-day mortality [adjusted 
odds ratio (OR) 2.25, P=0.019], 90-day mortality (adjusted OR 2.49, P=0.001) and 
1-year mortality [adjusted hazard ratio (HR) 1.58, P=0.03] of cardiac surgery in 
cox proportional hazard model. Elevated NLR was also associated with increased 
risk of continuous renal replacement therapy (CRRT) rate (adjusted OR 3.01, 
P=0.004), prolonged ICU stays (adjusted OR 2.55, P<0.001), prolonged hospital 
stays (adjusted OR 3.32, P<0.001) and duration of ventilatory support (adjusted 
OR 4.16, P<0.001) after adjusting confounders.
CONCLUSIONS: Elevated postoperative NLR was significantly associated with 
increased short-term and long-term mortality, CRRT rate, longer ICU and hospital 
stay, prolonged ventilation in patients undergoing cardiac surgery. NLR is 
promising to be a readily available and independent prognostic biomarker for 
patients with cardiac surgery.

Background: Hypertension is a rather common comorbidity among critically ill 
patients and hospital mortality might be higher among critically ill patients 
with hypertension (SBP ≥ 140 mmHg and/or DBP ≥ 90 mmHg). This study aimed to 
explore the association between ACEI/ARB medication during ICU stay and 
all-cause in-hospital mortality in these patients. Methods: A retrospective 
cohort study was conducted based on data from Medical Information Mart for 
Intensive Care IV (MIMIC-IV) database, which consisted of more than 40,000 
patients in ICU between 2008 and 2019 at Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center. 
Adults diagnosed with hypertension on admission and those had high blood 
pressure (SBP ≥ 140 mmHg and/or DBP ≥ 90 mmHg) during ICU stay were included. 
The primary outcome was all-cause in-hospital mortality. Patients were divided 
into ACEI/ARB treated and non-treated group during ICU stay. Propensity score 
matching (PSM) was used to adjust potential confounders. Nine machine learning 
models were developed and validated based on 37 clinical and laboratory features 
of all patients. The model with the best performance was selected based on area 
under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) followed by 5-fold 
cross-validation. After hyperparameter optimization using Grid and random 
hyperparameter search, a final LightGBM model was developed, and Shapley 
Additive exPlanations (SHAP) values were calculated to evaluate feature 
importance of each feature. The features closely associated with hospital 
mortality were presented as significant features. Results: A total of 15,352 
patients were enrolled in this study, among whom 5,193 (33.8%) patients were 
treated with ACEI/ARB. A significantly lower all-cause in-hospital mortality was 
observed among patients treated with ACEI/ARB (3.9 vs. 12.7%) as well as a lower 
28-day mortality (3.6 vs. 12.2%). The outcome remained consistent after 
propensity score matching. Among nine machine learning models, the LightGBM 
model had the highest AUC = 0.9935. The SHAP plot was employed to make the model 
interpretable based on LightGBM model after hyperparameter optimization, showing 
that ACEI/ARB use was among the top five significant features, which were 
associated with hospital mortality. Conclusions: The use of ACEI/ARB in 
critically ill patients with hypertension during ICU stay is related to lower 
all-cause in-hospital mortality, which was independently associated with 
increased survival in a large and heterogeneous cohort of critically ill 
hypertensive patients with or without kidney dysfunction.

Background: Plasma is commonly used in patients with coagulopathy; however, its 
role in patients with sepsis-induced coagulopathy (SIC) is unclear. This study 
aimed to evaluate the effect of plasma transfusion on the prognosis of patients 
with SIC. Methods: Data were collected from the Medical Information Mart for 
Intensive Care IV database. Multivariable logistic regression analysis was used 
to determine the association between plasma transfusion and the incidence of 
in-hospital mortality, pulmonary embolism, and lower extremity deep vein 
thrombosis in critically ill patients with SIC. Propensity score matching (PSM) 
and propensity score-based inverse probability of treatment weighting (IPTW) 
models were used to ensure the robustness of our findings. Furthermore, the 
nonparametric relationship between in-hospital mortality and plasma transfusion 
volume was analyzed using restricted cubic spline. Subgroups analyses were 
performed for age, sex, Charlson score, Sequential Organ Failure Assessment 
score, SIC score, and with hemorrhage. Results: A total of 8,747 patients with 
SIC were enrolled: of them, 1874 were in the plasma infusion group, and 6,873 
were in the no plasma infusion group. Compared with the no plasma infusion 
group, the plasma infusion group had higher in-hospital mortality (odds ratio 
[OR], 1.4411; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.2280-1.6897, P < 0.05), and the 
results were robust after PSM (OR, 1.3227; 95% CI, 1.1152-1.5697; P < 0.05) and 
IPTW (OR, 1.1541; 95% CI, 1.0738-1.2404; P < 0.05). Similar results were also 
observed in different subgroups. However, because of conflicting results after 
PSM and IPTW, we were unable to definitively link plasma transfusion with 
pulmonary embolism and deep vein thrombosis. Compared with the no early plasma 
transfusion group (≥12 h), the in-hospital mortality rate was lower in the early 
plasma transfusion group (<12 h) (OR, 0.5426; 95% CI, 0.4398-0.6844; P < 0.05). 
The restricted cubic spline analysis indicated that increased plasma transfusion 
was associated with increased in-hospital mortality in patients with SIC. 
Conclusion: Plasma transfusion increases in-hospital mortality in patients with 
SIC, and the mortality rate increases with the amount of plasma transfusion. 
Patients with SIC who received early plasma infusion had lower in-hospital 
mortality than those who received no early plasma transfusion.

BACKGROUND: There has been controversy about how obesity affects the clinical 
prognosis for patients with atrial fibrillation (AF), and the relationship 
between obesity and outcomes in critically ill patients with AF remains unclear. 
The purpose of this study was to explore the association between obesity and 
short- and medium-term mortality in critically ill patients with AF.
METHODS: The Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care-IV (MIMIC-IV) database 
was used to conduct a retrospective cohort analysis on 9282 critically ill 
patients with AF. Patients were categorized into four groups based on their body 
mass index (BMI) values: underweight, normal-weight, overweight, and obese. The 
outcomes of this study were 30-day, 90-day, and 1-year all-cause mortality. Cox 
proportional-hazards models and restricted cubic spline analyses were performed 
to investigate the association between BMI and mortality.
RESULTS: For 30-day mortality, after adjustment for all confounding factors, the 
hazard ratio (HR) with 95% confidence interval (CI) for the underweight, 
overweight, and obese categories were 1.58 (1.21, 2.07), 0.82 (0.72, 0.93), and 
0.79 (0.68, 0.91), respectively, compared to the normal-weight category. Using 
multivariable-adjusted restricted cubic spline analysis, an "L-shaped" 
correlation was observed between BMI and 30-day mortality. For each 1 kg/m2 
increase in BMI when BMI was less than 30 kg/m2, the risk of 30-day mortality 
decreased by 6.4% (HR, 95% CI: 0.936 [0.918, 0.954]; P < 0.001); however, this 
relationship was not present when BMI was greater than or equal to 30 kg/m2. 
Similar results were observed for 90-day and 1-year mortality.
CONCLUSIONS: There was a nonlinear relationship between BMI and all-cause 
mortality among critically ill patients with AF. All-cause mortality and the BMI 
were negatively correlated when the BMI was less than 30 kg/m2.

OBJECTIVE: We sought to evaluate the prognostic ability of blood urea nitrogen 
to serum albumin ratio (BAR) for acute kidney injury (AKI) and in-hospital 
mortality in patients with intracerebral haemorrhage (ICH) in intensive care 
unit (ICU).
DESIGN: A retrospective cohort study using propensity score matching.
SETTING: ICU of Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center.
PARTICIPANTS: The data of patients with ICH were obtained from the Medical 
Information Mart for Intensive Care IV (V.1.0) database. A total of 1510 
patients with ICH were enrolled in our study.
MAIN OUTCOME AND MEASURE: The optimal threshold value of BAR is determined by 
the means of X-tile software (V.3.6.1) and the crude cohort was categorised into 
two groups on the foundation of the optimal cut-off BAR (6.0 mg/g). Propensity 
score matching and inverse probability of treatment weighting were performed to 
control for confounders. The predictive performance of BAR for AKI was tested 
using univariate and multivariate logistic regression analyses. Multivariate Cox 
regression analysis was used to investigate the association between BAR and 
in-hospital mortality.
RESULTS: The optimal cut-off value for BAR was 6.0 mg/g. After matching, 
multivariate logistic analysis showed that the high-BAR group had a 
significantly higher risk of AKI (OR, 2.60; 95% confidence index, 95% CI, 1.86 
to 3.65, p<0.001). What's more, a higher BAR was also an independent risk factor 
for in-hospital mortality (HR, 2.84; 95% confidence index, 95% CI, 1.96 to 4.14, 
p<0.001) in terms of multivariate Cox regression analysis. These findings were 
further demonstrated in the validation cohort.
CONCLUSIONS: BAR is a promising and easily available biomarker that could serve 
as a prognostic predictor of AKI and in-hospital mortality in patients with ICH 
in the ICU.

BACKGROUND: The Geriatric Nutritional Risk Index (GNRI) is a clinical indicator 
for evaluating the nutritional status of patients, but its role in the 
short-term prognosis of patients with acute myocardial infarction is still not 
fully understood. This study aims to explore the correlation between the GNRI 
and the overall mortality within 30 days and 365 days in those with acute 
myocardial infarction (AMI).
METHODS: A retrospective analysis was performed utilizing the Medical 
Information Mart for Intensive Care IV (MIMIC-IV) database. The study included 
895 patients diagnosed with AMI and identified through ICD9 and ICD10 codes 
(410, I21, I23) who were hospitalized for the first time due to AMI. Subjects 
were classified into four groups according to GNRI: high (GNRI <82, n = 110), 
moderate (82 ≤ GNRI <92, n = 205), low (92 ≤ GNRI <98, n = 225), and no 
nutritional risk (GNRI ≥98, n = 355). Restricted cubic splines (RCS) and 
threshold effect analyses were applied to explore the non-linear relationship 
between GNRI and mortality. Subgroup analyses were conducted based on gender, 
hypertension, diabetes, stroke, hyperlipidemia, chronic obstructive pulmonary 
disease, and age. A mediation study was conducted to investigate the impact of 
lymphocytes on the association between GNRI and mortality.
RESULTS: In an overall sample of 895 patients, an elevated GNRI correlated with 
reduced 30-day (HR = 0.937, 95% CI: 0.917-0.957, p < 0.001) and 365-day 
mortality (HR = 0.937, 95% CI: 0.923-0.950, p < 0.001). The trend analysis for 
GNRI categories indicated a significant decline in mortality associated with 
rising GNRI (P for trend <0.001). Subgroup analysis validated the consistency of 
such results throughout diverse patient characteristics. The lymphocytes 
significantly mediated the relationship between GNRI and 30-day mortality (ACME: 
0.022, 95% CI: 0.003-0.180, p < 0.001). A landmark analysis at 20 days after 
admission further demonstrated the impact of GNRI on mortality during different 
phases of recovery.
CONCLUSION: This study highlights the prognostic value of GNRI in predicting 
short-term and long-term mortality in AMI patients, emphasizing the significance 
of nutritional status and inflammatory indicators in the therapy and risk 
assessment of these individuals.

BACKGROUND: Stress hyperglycemia ratio (SHR), which adjusts blood glucose levels 
using glycated hemoglobin to eliminate the influence of chronic hyperglycemia, 
has been demonstrated to have superior predictive value than absolute 
hyperglycemia. However, its predictive value for sepsis-associated acute kidney 
injury (SA-AKI) remains unclear. This study aimed to investigate the 
relationship between the SHR and the risk of developing SA-AKI.
METHODS: Data were extracted from the Medical Information Mart for Intensive 
Care IV (MIMIC-IV) database. Restricted cubic splines (RCS) were employed to 
depict the relationship between SHR and the likelihood of SA-AKI, determining an 
optimal cut-off value. Based on this threshold, patients were categorized into 
two groups. Logistic regression was utilized to evaluate SHR's predictive value 
for SA-AKI, with adjustments for confounding variables. Propensity score 
matching (PSM) was applied to balance baseline characteristics. Subgroup and 
sensitivity analyses were conducted.
RESULTS: A total of 2,249 patients were included. The RCS curve indicated a 
non-linear positive association between SHR and the likelihood of SA-AKI (P for 
non-linearity < 0.001), with an optimal cut-off at 1.55. Accordingly, patients 
were divided into SHR ≤ 1.55 and SHR > 1.55 subgroups, comprising 1,131 and 
1,118 individuals, respectively. A higher incidence of SA-AKI was observed in 
the SHR > 1.55 group (38.64% vs. 27.23%, P < 0.001). This association persisted 
after baseline adjustment through PSM. Logistic regression analysis confirmed 
that SHR > 1.55 was linked to increased odds of SA-AKI in both unadjusted (OR: 
1.68, P < 0.001) and adjusted models (OR: 1.73, P < 0.001), with SHR ≤ 1.55 
serving as the reference. In subgroup analysis, all subgroups consistently 
demonstrated a significant association between SHR > 1.55 and elevated odds of 
SA-AKI (all OR > 1). Sensitivity analysis validated that SHR > 1.55 remained 
significantly correlated with SA-AKI occurrence in the survival subgroup (OR: 
1.46, P < 0.001) and the non-CKD subgroup (OR: 1.69, P < 0.001).
CONCLUSION: The findings indicate a non-linear positive relationship between SHR 
and the likelihood of SA-AKI in patients with sepsis, suggesting that SHR could 
be a potential predictor for SA-AKI.

BACKGROUND: One of the significant changes in intensive care medicine over the 
past 2 decades is the acknowledgment that improper mechanical ventilation 
settings substantially contribute to pulmonary injury in critically ill 
patients. Artificial intelligence (AI) solutions can optimize mechanical 
ventilation settings in intensive care units (ICUs) and improve patient 
outcomes. Specifically, machine learning algorithms can be trained on large 
datasets of patient information and mechanical ventilation settings. These 
algorithms can then predict patient responses to different ventilation 
strategies and suggest personalized ventilation settings for individual 
patients.
OBJECTIVE: In this study, we aimed to design and evaluate an AI solution that 
could tailor an optimal ventilator strategy for each critically ill patient who 
requires mechanical ventilation.
METHODS: We proposed a reinforcement learning-based AI solution using 
observational data from multiple ICUs in the United States. The primary outcome 
was hospital mortality. Secondary outcomes were the proportion of optimal oxygen 
saturation and the proportion of optimal mean arterial blood pressure. We 
trained our AI agent to recommend low, medium, and high levels of 3 ventilator 
settings-positive end-expiratory pressure, fraction of inspired oxygen, and 
ideal body weight-adjusted tidal volume-according to patients' health 
conditions. We defined a policy as rules guiding ventilator setting changes 
given specific clinical scenarios. Off-policy evaluation metrics were applied to 
evaluate the AI policy.
RESULTS: We studied 21,595 and 5105 patients' ICU stays from the e-Intensive 
Care Unit Collaborative Research (eICU) and Medical Information Mart for 
Intensive Care IV (MIMIC-IV) databases, respectively. Using the learned AI 
policy, we estimated the hospital mortality rate (eICU 12.1%, SD 3.1%; MIMIC-IV 
29.1%, SD 0.9%), the proportion of optimal oxygen saturation (eICU 58.7%, SD 
4.7%; MIMIC-IV 49%, SD 1%), and the proportion of optimal mean arterial blood 
pressure (eICU 31.1%, SD 4.5%; MIMIC-IV 41.2%, SD 1%). Based on multiple 
quantitative and qualitative evaluation metrics, our proposed AI solution 
outperformed observed clinical practice.
CONCLUSIONS: Our study found that customizing ventilation settings for 
individual patients led to lower estimated hospital mortality rates compared to 
actual rates. This highlights the potential effectiveness of using reinforcement 
learning methodology to develop AI models that analyze complex clinical data for 
optimizing treatment parameters. Additionally, our findings suggest the 
integration of this model into a clinical decision support system for refining 
ventilation settings, supporting the need for prospective validation trials.

BACKGROUND: Sepsis-associated liver injury (SALI) is associated with poor 
outcomes and increased mortality. However, effectively stratifying SALI patients 
according to prognosis remains challenging. This study evaluates 
laboratory-based clustering filters for stratifying SALI patients by 30-day 
mortality risk, utilizing data mining techniques for novel pattern discovery.
METHODS: This retrospective cohort study analyzed SALI patients from two ICU 
databases: Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care (MIMIC)-IV database 
(n = 73,181, study period: 2008 to 2019) and Amsterdam UMC (n = 16,194, study 
period: 2003 to 2016). Patients were identified using Sepsis-3 criteria and 
liver injury markers. Risk stratification employed three laboratory-based 
approaches: (I) De Ritis ratio (aspartate aminotransferase/alanine 
aminotransferase), (II) R-factor (alanine aminotransferase and alkaline 
phosphatase relative to their upper limits of normal), and (III) alanine 
aminotransferase elevation. Kaplan-Meier analysis and multivariable Cox 
regression assessed the association between stratification methods and 30-day 
mortality risk.
FINDINGS: SALI patients had almost a 2-fold higher risk of 30-day mortality than 
those without SALI (hazard ratio: 1.73; 95%-CI: 1.58-1.90, p < 0.0001). Each 
stratification method (I-III) successfully classified patients into 
statistically distinct risk strata. The De Ritis ratio emerged as the strongest 
prognostic differentiation method: a ratio ≤1 indicated no significant increase 
in mortality risk (hazard ratio: 0.86; 95%-CI: 0.68-1.09, p = 0.21), whereas 
ratios of 1-2 and ≥2 were significantly associated with higher mortality (hazard 
ratio: 1.56; 95%-CI: 1.37-1.78, p < 0.0001 and hazard ratio: 2.46; 95%-CI: 
2.18-2.77, p < 0.0001, respectively). All findings were confirmed in the 
validation cohort.
INTERPRETATION: The De Ritis ratio serves as a valuable prognostic tool for 
30-day mortality in SALI patients. Our findings indicate that patients with a 
ratio ≥1 face significantly worse outcomes, highlighting the need for targeted 
interventions. These results refine risk stratification in SALI subphenotypes, 
enhancing our understanding of its prognostic implications.
FUNDING: This study received no external funding and was solely financed through 
the departmental resources of the authors.

PURPOSE: Hemoglobin (Hb) levels and red cell distribution width (RDW) are 
standard and widely used parameters that predict clinical outcomes in patients 
with chronic heart failure (CHF). The Hb to RDW ratio (HRR) provides an 
incremental clinical prediction, as it reflects the various clinical 
characteristics of patients. No published data exists in the Medical Information 
Mart for Intensive Care (MIMIC-IV) and eICU Collaborative Research Database 
(eICU-CRD) databases on HRR and its association with in-hospital mortality among 
patients with CHF. The aim of this study was to evaluate the relationship 
between the HRR and in-hospital mortality in two large real-world cohorts of 
patients with chronic CHF.
PATIENTS AND METHODS: Data from the MIMIC-IV and eICU-CRD databases were used to 
explore the association between HRR and in-hospital mortality. 
Multivariate logistic regression, stratified analysis with interaction, and 
restricted cubic splines were used to investigate the association between 
HRR and in-hospital mortality.
RESULTS:  A total of 30,411 patients with CHF were enrolled based on the 
MIMIC-IV and multicenter eICU-CRD databases (15,983 and 14,428, respectively), 
including 16,295 men and 14,116 women with a median age of 73 years. The mean 
HRR was 0.69 ± 0.20. The overall in-hospital mortality rate was 12.63%. 
Increasing quantiles of HRR were associated with reduced in-hospital mortality 
rates. After adjusting for significant predictors, multivariate logistic 
regression analysis demonstrated that a low HRR was a significant predictor of 
in-hospital mortality, with a graded reduction in risk as HRR increased. 
Sensitivity analysis using restricted cubic splines demonstrated a continuous 
increase in in-hospital mortality risk with decreasing HRR (P = 0.262 for the 
non-linear model).
CONCLUSION: A linear relationship was observed between baseline HRR levels and 
in-hospital mortality. Lower HRR levels were associated with higher in-hospital 
mortality in patients with CHF. HRR could be a reliable clinical metric for 
assessing in-hospital mortality risk.

BACKGROUND: Sepsis is a leading cause of mortality in intensive care units and 
vasoactive drugs are widely used in septic patients. The cardiovascular response 
of septic shock patients during resuscitation therapies and the relationship of 
the cardiovascular response and clinical outcome has not been clearly described.
METHODS: We included adult patients admitted to the ICU with sepsis from Peking 
Union Medical College Hospital (internal), Medical Information Mart for 
Intensive Care IV (MIMIC-IV) and eICU Collaborative Research Database 
(eICU-CRD). The Blood Pressure Response Index (BPRI) was defined as the ratio 
between the mean arterial pressure and the vasoactive-inotropic score. BRRI was 
compared with existing risk scores on predicting in-hospital death. The 
relationship between BPRI and in-hospital mortality was calculated. A XGBoost's 
machine learning model identified the features that influence short-term changes 
in BPRI.
FINDINGS: There were 2139, 9455, and 4202 patients in the internal, MIMIC-IV and 
eICU-CRD cohorts, respectively. BPRI had a better AUROC for predicting 
in-hospital mortality than SOFA (0.78 vs. 0.73, p = 0.01) and APS (0.78 vs. 
0.74, p = 0.03) in the internal cohort. The estimated odds ratio for death per 
unit decrease in BPRI was 1.32 (95% CI 1.20-1.45) when BPRI was below 7.1 vs. 
0.99 (95% CI 0.97-1.01) when BPRI was above 7.1 in the internal cohort; similar 
relationships were found in MIMIC-IV and eICU-CRD. Respiratory support and 
latest cumulative 12-h fluid balance were intervention-related features 
influencing BPRI.
INTERPRETATION: BPRI is an easy, rapid, precise indicator of the response of 
patients with septic shock to vasoactive drugs. It is a comparable and even 
better predictor of prognosis than SOFA and APS in sepsis and it is simpler and 
more convenient in use. The application of BPRI could help clinicians identify 
potentially at-risk patients and provide clues for treatment.

BACKGROUND: The role of intra-aortic balloon counterpulsation (IABP) in 
cardiogenic shock complicating acute myocardial infarction (AMI) is still a 
subject of intense debate. In this study, we aim to investigate the effect of 
IABP on the clinical outcomes of patients with AMI complicated by cardiogenic 
shock undergoing percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI).
METHODS: From the Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care (MIMIC)-IV 2.2, 
6017 AMI patients were subtracted, and 250 patients with AMI complicated by 
cardiogenic shock undergoing PCI were analyzed. In-hospital outcomes (death, 
24-hour urine volumes, length of ICU stays, and length of hospital stays) and 
1-year mortality were compared between IABP and control during the hospital 
course and 12-month follow-up.
RESULTS: An IABP was implanted in 30.8% (77/250) of patients with 
infarct-related cardiogenic shock undergoing PCI. IABP patients had higher 
levels of Troponin T (3.94 [0.73-11.85] ng/ml vs. 1.99 [0.55-5.75] ng/ml, 
p-value = 0.02). IABP patients have a longer length of ICU and hospital stays 
(124 [63-212] hours vs. 83 [43-163] hours, p-value = 0.005; 250 [128-435] hours 
vs. 170 [86-294] hours, p-value = 0.009). IABP use was not associated with lower 
in-hospital mortality (33.8% vs. 33.0%, p-value = 0.90) and increased 24-hour 
urine volumes (2100 [1455-3208] ml vs. 1915 [1110-2815] ml, p-value = 0.25). In 
addition, 1-year mortality was not different between the IABP and the control 
group (48.1% vs. 48.0%; hazard ratio 1.04, 95% CI 0.70-1.54, p-value = 0.851).
CONCLUSION: IABP may be associated with longer ICU and hospital stays but not 
better short-and long-term clinical prognosis.

BACKGROUND: Sepsis has long been a life-threatening organ dysfunction. Sepsis 
associated acute kidney injury (SA-AKI) is an important complication of sepsis, 
as an important hemodynamic index, the impact of central venous pressure (CVP) 
on sepsis patients needs to be explored. Thus this study aimed to investigate 
the relationship between CVP and the mortality of SA-AKI.
METHODS: Clinical data of adult patients with sepsis-related acute kidney 
injury, defined as met both the Sepsis 3.0 criteria and the Kidney Disease 
Improving Global Outcomes Clinical Practice Guideline (KDIGO) criteria, were 
obtained from the Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care-IV (MIMIC-IV) 
database. The included cohort was divided into a high CVP and a low CVP group 
were determined based on the cuf-off value from receiver operating 
characteristic curve, with propensity score-matched analysis of the 28-day 
mortality for both groups and sensitivity analysis using inverse the 
probability-weighting model, multifactorial regression, and doubly robust 
estimation, patients acquired chronic coronary syndrome (CCS) and diabetes were 
also taken into consideration.
RESULTS: Of 1,377 patients with sepsis-related acute kidney injury, low CVP 
group (<13 mmHg) was 67.4% (n=928) and high CVP group (≥13 mmHg) was 32.6% 
(n=449). The two groups were matched 1:1 by propensity score to obtain a matched 
cohort (n=288). The mortality rates in the low versus high CVP group (19.4% vs. 
34.7%) were statistically difference (odds ratio OR: 0.454; 95% confidence 
interval 0.263, 0.771). Moreover, the bistable analysis of logistic regression 
of the matched cohort (OR: 0.434; 95% CI: 0.244, 0.757), propensity score 
inverse probability weighting (IPW) (OR: 0.547; 95% CI: 0.454, 0.658), and 
multifactorial logistic regression (OR: 0.352; 95% CI: 0.127, 0.932) all yielded 
the same results.
CONCLUSIONS: In patients with sepsis-related acute kidney injury, a lower CVP 
level (<13 mmHg) is an independent variable associated with decreased mortality. 
The threshold of CVP needs to be controlled in clinical work to improve the 
prognosis of patients with SA-AKI.

INTRODUCTION: Studies have shown nonlinear relationships between systolic blood 
pressure (SBP) and outcomes, with increased risk observed at both low and high 
blood pressure levels. However, the relationships between cumulative times at 
different SBP levels and outcomes in critically ill patients remain unclear. We 
hypothesized that an appropriate SBP level is associated with a decrease in 
adverse outcomes after intensive care unit (ICU) admission.
METHODS: This study was a retrospective analysis of data from the Medical 
Information Mart for Intensive Care (MIMIC) III database, which includes more 
than 1,000,000 SBP records from 12,820 patients. Associations of cumulative 
times at four SBP ranges (<100 mm Hg, 100-120 mm Hg, 120-140 mm Hg, and ≥140 mm 
Hg) with mortality (12-, 3-, 1-month mortality and in-hospital mortality) were 
evaluated. Restricted cubic splines and multivariable Cox regression models were 
employed to assess associations between mortality and cumulative times at SBP 
levels (4 levels: <2, 2-12, 12-36, and ≥36 h) over 72 h of ICU admission. 
Additionally, 120 mm Hg to 140 mm Hg was subdivided into <12 h (Group L) and 
≥12 h (Group M) subsets and subjected to propensity-score matching and subgroup 
analyses.
RESULTS: At 120 mm Hg to 140 mm Hg, level-4 SBP was associated with lower 
adjusted risks of mortality at 12 months (OR, 0.71; CI, 0.61-0.81), 3 months 
(OR, 0.72; CI, 0.61-0.85), and 1 month (OR, 0.61; CI, 0.48-0.79) and in the 
hospital (OR, 0.71; CI, 0.58-0.88) than level-1 SBP. The cumulative times at the 
other 3 SBP ranges (<100 mm Hg, 100-120 mm Hg, and ≥140 mm Hg) were not 
independent risk predictors of prognosis. Furthermore, Group M had lower 
12-month mortality than Group L, which remained in the propensity-score matched 
and subgroup analyses.
CONCLUSIONS: SBP at 120 mm Hg to 140 mm Hg was associated with decreased adverse 
outcomes. Randomized trials are required to determine whether the outcomes in 
critically ill patients improve with early maintenance of a SBP level at 120 mm 
Hg to 140 mm Hg.

PURPOSE: Acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) is one of the most common 
causes of death in intensive care units (ICU). Previous studies have reported 
the potential protective effect of obesity on ARDS patients. However, these 
findings are inconsistent, in which less was reported on long-term prognosis and 
diagnosed ARDS by Berlin definition. This study aimed to investigate the 
relationship between obesity and short-term and long-term mortality in patients 
with ARDS based on the Berlin Definition.
METHODS: This is a retrospective cohort study from the Medical Information Mart 
for Intensive Care III (MIMIC-III) database, in which all the patients were 
diagnosed with ARDS according to the Berlin definition. The patients were 
divided into four groups according to the WHO body mass index (BMI) categories. 
The multivariable logistic regression and Cox regression analysis were used to 
investigate the relationship between BMI and short-term and long-term mortality.
RESULT: A total of 2,378 patients with ARDS were enrolled in our 
study. In-hospital mortality was 27.92%, and 1,036 (43.57%) patients had died 
after 1-year follow-up. After adjusting for confounders, the in-hospital and 
1-year mortality risks of obese patients were significantly lower than those of 
normal weight (OR 0.72, 95%CI 0.55-0.94, P=0.0168; HR 0.80, 95%CI 0.68-0.94 
P=0.0084; respectively), while those mortality risks of underweight patients 
were higher than normal weight patients (P=0.0102, P=0.0184; respectively). The 
smooth curve showed that BMI, which was used as a continuous variable, was 
negatively correlated with in-hospital and 1-year mortality. The results were 
consistent after being stratified by age, gender, race, type of admission, 
severity of organ dysfunction, and severity of ARDS. The Kaplan-Meier survival 
curves showed that obese patients had significant lower 1-year mortality than 
normal weight patients.
CONCLUSION: We found that obesity was associated with decreased risk of 
short-term and long-term mortality in patients with ARDS.

BACKGROUND: Inflammation plays a crucial role in cerebrovascular disease (CVD) 
progression. Neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio (NLR) is an important inflammatory 
marker, though its diagnostic role in CVD is still under investigation. This 
study evaluates the relationship between NLR and short-term all-cause mortality 
in patients with CVD admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU).
METHODS: We conducted a retrospective study using data from the Medical 
Information Mart for Intensive Care (MIMIC-IV) (v2.2) database, including 4,327 
adult ICU-admitted CVD patients. NLR values at admission were analyzed alongside 
various mortality variables. Multivariate Cox proportional hazards regression 
models and Kaplan-Meier (K-M) survival curves assessed the relationship between 
NLR and short-term all-cause mortality. Predictive power, sensitivity, 
specificity, and area under the curve (AUC) of NLR for short-term mortality were 
investigated using Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) analysis. 
Additionally, restricted cubic spline (RCS) curves and subgroup analyses were 
conducted.
RESULTS: Among the 4,327 patients, 3,600 survived (survival group) and 727 died 
(non-survival group) within 28 days of admission (mortality rate: 16.8%). A 
multivariate Cox regression analysis identified NLR as an independent predictor 
of 28-day all-cause mortality (hazard ratio: 1.013; 95% confidence interval: 
1.0086-1.0188; p < 0.001). The predictive model, incorporating NLR, age, gender, 
BMI, Charlson comorbidity index (CCI), WBC counts, Platelet, INR, and CRP, 
achieved an AUC of 0.686 (95% confidence interval: 0.665-0.70). While 
platelet-to-lymphocyte ratio was also analyzed, its predictive efficiency was 
less pronounced compared to NLR. A best NLR threshold of 6.19 was determined, 
distinguishing survivors from non-survivors. Kaplan-Meier survival curves showed 
that patients with NLR ≥ 6.19 had significantly lower survival rates at 7-, 14-, 
21-, and 28-days. Subgroup analyses indicated that NLR did not significantly 
interact with most subgroups.
CONCLUSION: NLR may serve as an independent predictor for short-term all-cause 
mortality in ICU-admitted CVD patients, enhancing our understanding of the 
association between inflammatory biomarkers and CVD prognosis.

BACKGROUND: A survival prediction model based on deep learning has higher 
accuracy than the CPH model in predicting the survival of CCU patients, and it 
also has a better discrimination ability. We collected information on patients 
with various diseases in coronary care units (CCUs) from the Medical Information 
Mart for Intensive Care III (MIMIC-III) database. The purpose of this study was 
to use this information to construct a neural-network model based on deep 
learning to predict the survival probabilities of patients with conditions that 
are common in CCUs.
METHOD: We collected information on patients in the United States with five 
common diseases in CCUs from 2001 to 2012. We randomly divided the patients into 
a training cohort and a testing cohort at a ratio of 7 : 3 and applied a 
survival prediction method based on deep learning to predict their survival 
probability. We compared our model with the Cox proportional-hazards regression 
(CPH) model and used the concordance indexes (C-indexes), receiver operating 
characteristic (ROC) curve, and calibration plots to evaluate the predictive 
performance of the model.
RESULTS: The 3,388 CCU patients included in the study were randomly divided into 
2,371 in the training cohort and 1,017 in the testing cohort. The stepwise 
regression results showed that the important factors affecting patient survival 
were the type of disease, age, race, anion gap, glucose, neutrophils, white 
blood cells, potassium, creatine kinase, and blood urea nitrogen (P < 0.05). We 
used the training cohort to construct a deep-learning model, for which the 
C-index was 0.833, or about 5% higher than that for the CPH model (0.786). The 
C-index of the deep-learning model for the test cohort was 0.822, which was also 
higher than that for the CPH model (0.782). The areas under the ROC curve for 
the 28-day, 90-day, and 1-year survival probabilities were 0.875, 0.865, and 
0.874, respectively, in the deep-learning model, respectively, and 0.830, 0.843, 
and 0.806 in the CPH model. These values indicate that the survival analysis 
model based on deep learning is better than the traditional CPH model in 
predicting the survival of CCU patients.
CONCLUSION: A survival prediction model based on deep learning has higher 
accuracy than the CPH model in predicting the survival of CCU patients, and it 
also has a better discrimination ability.

BACKGROUND: This study aimed to develop and validate a nomogram for predicting 
acute kidney injury (AKI) during the Intensive Care Unit (ICU) stay of patients 
with diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA).
METHODS: A total of 760 patients diagnosed with DKA from the Medical Information 
Mart for Intensive Care III (MIMIC-III) database were included and randomly 
divided into a training set (70%, n = 532) and a validation set (30%, n = 228). 
Clinical characteristics of the data set were utilized to establish a nomogram 
for the prediction of AKI during ICU stay. The least absolute shrinkage and 
selection operator (LASSO) regression was utilized to identified candidate 
predictors. Meanwhile, a multivariate logistic regression analysis was performed 
based on variables derived from LASSO regression, in which variables with 
P < 0.1 were included in the final model. Then, a nomogram was constructed 
applying these significant risk predictors based on a multivariate logistic 
regression model. The discriminatory ability of the model was determined by 
illustrating a receiver operating curve (ROC) and calculating the area under the 
curve (AUC). Moreover, the calibration plot and Hosmer-Lemeshow goodness-of-fit 
test (HL test) were conducted to evaluate the performance of our newly bullied 
nomogram. Decision curve analysis (DCA) was performed to evaluate the clinical 
net benefit.
RESULTS: A multivariable model that included type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM), 
microangiopathy, history of congestive heart failure (CHF), history of 
hypertension, diastolic blood pressure (DBP), urine output, Glasgow coma scale 
(GCS), and respiratory rate (RR) was represented as the nomogram. The predictive 
model demonstrated satisfied discrimination with an AUC of 0.747 (95% CI, 
0.706-0.789) in the training dataset, and 0.712 (95% CI, 0.642-0.782) in the 
validation set. The nomogram showed well-calibrated according to the calibration 
plot and HL test (P > 0.05). DCA showed that our model was clinically useful.
CONCLUSION: The nomogram predicted model for predicting AKI in patients with DKA 
was constructed. This predicted model can help clinical physicians to identify 
the patients with high risk earlier and prevent the occurrence of AKI and 
intervene timely to improve prognosis.

AIMS: Serum calcium level is widely used for evaluating disease severity, but 
its impact on clinical outcomes in patients with congestive heart failure (CHF) 
remains poorly understood. The aim of this study is to investigate the 
relationship between serum calcium levels and in-hospital mortality in CHF 
patients.
METHODS AND RESULTS: We conducted a retrospective analysis utilizing clinical 
data from the Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care database, encompassing 
a cohort of 15 983 CHF patients. This cohort was stratified based on their serum 
calcium levels, with the primary objective being the determination of 
in-hospital mortality. To assess the impact of admission serum calcium levels on 
in-hospital mortality, we employed various statistical methodologies, including 
multivariable logistic regression models, a generalized additive model, a 
two-piecewise linear regression model, and subgroup analysis. Comparative 
analysis of the reference group (Q3) revealed increased in-hospital mortality in 
the first quintile (Q1, the group with the lowest blood calcium level) and the 
fifth quintile (Q5, the group with the highest blood calcium level), with fully 
adjusted odds ratios of 1.38 [95% confidence interval (CI): 1.13-1.68, 
P = 0.002] and 1.23 (95% CI: 1.01-1.5, P = 0.038), respectively. A U-shaped 
relationship was observed between serum calcium levels and in-hospital 
mortality, with the lowest risk occurring at a threshold of 8.35 mg/dL. The 
effect sizes and corresponding CIs below and above this threshold were 0.782 
(95% CI: 0.667-0.915, P = 0.0023) and 1.147 (95% CI: 1.034-1.273, P = 0.0094), 
respectively. Stratified analyses confirmed the robustness of this correlation.
CONCLUSIONS: Our study identifies a U-shaped association between serum calcium 
levels and in-hospital mortality in CHF patients, with a notable inflection 
point at 8.35 mg/dL. Further investigation through prospective, randomized, and 
controlled studies is warranted to validate the findings presented in this 
study.

BACKGROUND: Falls are a major public health problem in the older adults that can 
lead to poor clinical outcomes. There have been few reports on the short-term 
prognoses of older critically ill patients, and so we sought to determine the 
impact of falls on elderly patients in intensive care units (ICUs).
PATIENTS AND METHODS: This retrospective study of 4503 patients (aged 65 years 
or older) analyzed data in the Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care-III 
critical care database. Of those, 2459 (54.6%) older adults are males, and 2044 
(45.4%) older adults are females. Based on information from the medical care 
record assessment forms, patients were classified into the following two groups 
based on whether they had a fall within the previous 3 months: falls (n=1142) 
and nonfalls (n=3361). The primary outcomes of this study were 30- and 90-day 
mortality. Associations between the results of the Kaplan-Meier (KM) survival 
analysis, Cox proportional-hazards regression models, and subgroup analysis and 
its outcomes were analyzed using stabilized inverse probability treatment 
weighting (IPTW).
RESULTS: KM survival curves with stabilized IPTW indicated that 30- and 90-day 
survival rates were significantly lower in elderly critically ill patients with 
a history of falls within the previous 3 months than in those patients without a 
history of falls (all p<0.001). Multivariate Cox proportional-hazards regression 
analysis indicated that 30- and 90-day mortality rates were 1.35 times higher 
(95% confidence interval [CI]=1.16-1.57, p<0.001) and 1.36 times higher (95% 
CI=1.19-1.55, p<0.001), respectively, in elderly critically ill patients with a 
history of falls within the previous 3 months than in those patients without a 
history of falls.
CONCLUSION: Experience of falls within the previous 3 months prior to ICU 
admission increased the risk of short-term mortality and affected the prognoses 
of elderly patients. Falls should therefore receive adequate attention from 
clinical healthcare providers and management decision-makers.

AIMS: There has been a lack of research examining the relationship between red 
cell distribution width (RDW) and the prognosis of cardiac arrest (CA) patients. 
The prognostic value of the changes in RDW during intensive care unit (ICU) 
hospitalization for CA patients has not been investigated. This study aims to 
investigate the correlation between RDW measures at ICU admission and RDW 
changes during ICU hospitalization and the prognosis of CA patients and then 
develop a nomogram that predicts the risk of mortality of these patients.
METHODS AND RESULTS: A retrospective cohort study is used to collect clinical 
characteristics of CA patients (>18 years) that are on their first admission to 
ICU with RDW data measured from the Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care 
IV Version 2.0 database. Patients are randomly divided into a development cohort 
(75%) and a validation cohort (25%). The primary outcome is 30 and 360 day 
all-cause mortality. ΔRDW is defined as the RDW on ICU discharge minus RDW on 
ICU admission. A multivariate Cox regression model is applied to test whether 
the RDW represents an independent risk factor that affects the all-cause 
mortality of these patients. Meanwhile, the dose-response relationship between 
the RDW and the mortality is described by restricted cubic spine (RCS). A 
prediction model is constructed using a nomogram, which is then assessed using 
receiver operating characteristic curves, calibration curves, and decision curve 
analysis (DCA). A total of 1278 adult CA patients are included in this study. We 
found that non-survivors have a higher level of RDW and ΔRDW compared with 
survivors, and the mortality rate is higher in the high RDW group than in the 
normal RDW group. The Kaplan-Meier survival curve indicates that patients in the 
normal RDW group had a higher cumulative survival rate at 30 and 360 days than 
those in the high RDW group (log-rank test, χ2  = 36.710, χ2  = 54.960, both P 
values <0.05). The multivariate Cox regression analysis shows that elevated RDW 
at ICU admission (>15.50%) is an independent predictor of 30 [hazard 
ratio = 1.451, 95% confidence interval (CI) = 1.181-1.782, P < 0.001] and 
360 day (hazard ratio = 1.393, 95% CI = 1.160-1.671, P < 0.001) all-cause 
mortality among CA patients, and an increase in RDW during ICU hospitalization 
(ΔRDW ≥ 0.4%) can serve as an independent predictor of mortality among these 
patients. A non-linear relationship between the RDW measured at ICU admission 
and the increased risk of mortality rate of these patients is shown by the RCS. 
This study established and validated a nomogram based on six variables, anion 
gap, first-day Sequential Organ Failure Assessment score, cerebrovascular 
disease, malignant tumour, norepinephrine use, and RDW, to predict mortality 
risk in CA patients. The consistency indices of 30 and 360 day mortality of CA 
patients in the validation cohort are 0.721 and 0.725, respectively. The 
nomogram proved to be well calibrated in the validation cohort. DCA curves 
indicated that the nomogram provided a higher net benefit over a wide, 
reasonable range of threshold probabilities for predicting mortality in CA 
patients and could be adapted for clinical decision-making.
CONCLUSIONS: Elevated RDW levels on ICU admission and rising RDW during ICU 
hospitalization are powerful predictors of all-cause mortality for CA patients 
at 30 and 360 days, and they can be used as potential clinical biomarkers to 
predict the bad prognosis of these patients. The newly developed nomogram, which 
includes RDW, demonstrates high efficacy in predicting the mortality of CA 
patients.

BACKGROUND: The impact of pulmonary hypertension (PH) on critically ill patients 
has not been fully understood. Our objective was to explore the possible 
relationship between PH and the outcomes in Intensive Care Unit (ICU) patients, 
and to determine risk factors of in-hospital mortality of ICU PH patients.
METHODS: The Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care (MIMIC)-IV database was 
used. Patient characteristics and clinical outcomes of ICU patients with or 
without PH were compared. The primary outcome was the in-hospital-mortality, and 
secondary outcome was 28-day mortality. Multivariate logistic regression 
analysis was conducted to determine independent risk factors of in-hospital 
mortality.
RESULTS: A total of 42,255 patients were included in the study, of which 1,210 
patients had a diagnosis of PH and 4,262 patients died during the hospital stay. 
In-hospital mortality in the PH and non-PH groups were 15.1% and 9.9% 
respectively (P < 0.01). The length of stay in ICU and in hospital among ICU PH 
patients were longer than those without (P < 0.01), and PH group also showed 
higher 28-day mortality (P < 0.01). Multivariate logistic regression analysis 
indicated that PH was an independent risk factor for in-hospital mortality in 
critical ill patients [OR = 1.22, (95%CI: 1.02-1.46), P = 0.033]. Oxford Acute 
Severity of Illness (OASIS) [OR = 1.10, (95%CI: 1.08-1.12), P < 0.01] anion gap 
[OR = 1.07, (95%CI: 1.04-1.11), P < 0.01], and Charlson's score [OR = 1.09, 
(95%CI: 1.03-1.16), P < 0.01] were independent risk factors for in-hospital 
mortality among ICU PH patients.
CONCLUSIONS: PH diangsoed in the ICU setting has unfavorable clinical outcomes. 
The Bigger the value of OASIS score, anion gap, Charlson's score were the 
predictors for in-hospital mortality in ICU patients with PH.

OBJECTIVE: This study aims to assess the performance of various scoring systems 
in predicting the 28-day mortality of patients with aortic aneurysms (AA) 
admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU).
METHODS: We utilized data from the Medical Information Mart for Intensive 
Care-IV (MIMIC-IV) to perform a comparative analysis of various predictive 
systems, including the Glasgow Aneurysm Score (GAS), Simplified Acute Physiology 
Score (SAPS) III, SAPS II, Logical Organ Dysfunction System (LODS), Sequential 
Organ Failure Assessment (SOFA), Systemic Inflammatory Response Syndrome (SIRS), 
and The Oxford Acute Illness Severity Score (OASIS). The discrimination 
abilities of these systems were compared using the area under the receiver 
operating characteristic curve (AUROC). Additionally, a 4-knotted restricted 
cubic spline regression was employed to evaluate the association between the 
different scoring systems and the risk of 28-day mortality. Finally, we 
conducted a subgroup analysis focusing on patients with abdominal aortic 
aneurysms (AAA).
RESULTS: This study enrolled 586 patients with AA (68.39% male). Among them, 26 
patients (4.4%) died within 28 days. Comparative analysis revealed higher SAPS 
II, SAPS III, SOFA, LODS, OASIS, and SIRS scores in the deceased group, while no 
statistically significant difference was observed in GAS scores between the 
survivor and deceased groups (P = 0.148). The SAPS III system exhibited superior 
predictive value for the 28-day mortality rate (AUROC 0.805) compared to the 
LODS system (AUROC 0.771), SOFA (AUROC 0.757), SAPS II (AUROC 0.759), OASIS 
(AUROC 0.742), SIRS (AUROC 0.638), and GAS (AUROC 0.586) systems. The results of 
the univariate and multivariate logistic analyses showed that SAPS III was 
statistically significant for both 28-day and 1-year mortality. Subgroup 
analyses yielded results consistent with the overall findings. No nonlinear 
relationship was identified between these scoring systems and 28-day all-cause 
mortality (P for nonlinear > 0.05).
CONCLUSION: The SAPS III system demonstrated superior discriminatory ability for 
both 28-day and 1-year mortality compared to the GAS, SAPS II SIRS, SOFA, and 
OASIS systems among patients with AA.

OBJECTIVE: Disease prediction is crucial to treatment success. The aim of this 
study was to accurately and explicably predict, based on the first laboratory 
measurements, medications, and demographic information, the risk of death in 
patients with hypertensive chronic kidney disease within 1 and 3 years after 
admission to the Intensive Care Unit (ICU).
METHODS: Patients with hypertensive chronic kidney disease who had been 
registered in the Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care (MIMIC-III) 
database of critical care medicine were set as the subject of study, which was 
randomly divided into a training set and a validation set in a ratio of 7 : 3. 
Univariate Cox regression analysis and stepwise Cox regression analysis were 
applied in the training set to identify the predictive factors of prognosis of 
patients with hypertensive chronic kidney disease in ICU, and the predictive 
nomogram based on Cox regression model was constructed. We internally validated 
the model in the training set and externally validated that in the validation 
model. The efficacy was assessed primarily through area under the receiver 
operating characteristic (ROC) curve, clinical decision curves, and calibration 
curves.
RESULTS: A total of 1762 patients with hypertensive chronic kidney disease were 
finally included. During the 3-year follow-up, 667 patients (37.85%) died, with 
a median follow-up time of 220 days (1-1090). The data set were randomly divided 
into a training set (n = 1231) and a validation set (n = 531). It was identified 
in the training set that insurance, albumin, alkaline phosphatase, the mean 
corpuscular hemoglobin concentration, mean corpuscular volume, history of 
coronary angiogram, hyperlipemia, medication of digoxin, acute renal failure, 
and history of renal surgery were the most relevant features. Taking 1 year and 
3 years as the cut-off points, the AUC of participants were 0.736 and 0.744, 
respectively, in the internal validation and were 0.775 and 0.769, respectively, 
in the external validation, suggesting that the model is of favorable predictive 
efficacy.
CONCLUSION: We trained and validated a model using data from a large multicenter 
cohort, which has considerable predictive performance on an individual scale and 
could be used to improve treatment strategies.

This study aims to explore the relationship between the albumin-corrected anion 
gap (ACAG) and short- and long-term all-cause mortality (ACM) in patients with 
acute pancreatitis (AP) managed in the intensive care unit (ICU). We conducted a 
retrospective analysis utilizing data extracted from the Medical Information 
Mart for Intensive Care-IV (MIMIC-IV) database. This study sought to investigate 
the correlation between ACAG and ACM among patients diagnosed with AP across 
various disease stages. R statistical software was used to identify the optimal 
thresholds for ACAG. Kaplan-Meier survival curves and multivariate Cox 
proportional hazards regression models were employed to assess the association 
between ACAG and short- and long-term ACM of AP. The predictive ability, 
sensitivity, specificity, and area under the curve (AUC) of ACAG for short- and 
long-term ACM in AP were investigated using receiver operating characteristic 
analysis. Subgroup analyses were also conducted. A cohort comprising 605 
participants was included in this study. The ideal threshold for ACAG identified 
by R statistical software was 21.5. Cox proportional hazards modeling revealed 
that there was an independent association between patients with AP with 
ACAG ≥ 21.5 and ACM at 3, 7, 10, 14, 28, 90, and 180 days and 1 year before and 
after adjustment for confounders. Survival curves demonstrated that patients 
with ACAG ≥ 21.5 had lower survival rates at 3, 7, 10, 14, 28, 90, and 180 days 
and 1 year. In addition, ACAG showed superior performance, with a larger AUC 
than the anion gap, albumin, and Systemic Inflammatory Response Syndrome score 
and Sequential Organ Failure Assessment at 3, 7, 10, 14, 28, 90, and 180 days 
and 1 year. Subgroup analysis revealed no significant interaction between ACAG 
and any subgroups Elevated levels of ACAG were found to be associated with 
increased short- and long-term ACM in patients with AP, and ACAG may be an 
independent predictor of ACM at different disease stages.

OBJECTIVE: To explore the risk factors affecting the prognosis of patients with 
sepsis complicated with acute pulmonary embolism, and to construct and validate 
a nomogram predictive model for in-hospital mortality risk.
METHODS: Based on the American Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care 
(MIMIC-III, MIMIC-IV) databases, the data were collected on patients with sepsis 
complicated with acute pulmonary embolism from 2001 to 2019, including baseline 
characteristics, and vital signs, disease scores, laboratory tests within 24 
hours of admission to the intensive care unit (ICU), and interventions. 
In-hospital mortality was the outcome event. The total samples were divided into 
training and testing sets in a 7:3 ratio by random sampling. Univariate Cox 
regression analysis was used to verify the impact of all variables on the risk 
of in-hospital mortality, thereby screen potential influencing factors. 
Subsequently, a stepwise bi-directional regression method was applied to select 
factors one by one, leading to the construction of a nomogram prediction model. 
Collinearity testing was used to demonstrate the absence of strong 
multicollinearity among the influencing factors in the nomogram prediction 
model. The discrimination of the nomogram model, sequential organ failure 
assessment (SOFA), and simplified pulmonary embolism severity index (sPESI) was 
evaluated using C-index in the test set. Receiver operator characteristic curve 
(ROC curve) was drawn to evaluate the predictive value of various models for 
in-hospital mortality in patients with sepsis complicated with acute pulmonary 
embolism.
RESULTS: A total of 562 patients with sepsis complicated with acute pulmonary 
embolism were included, including 393 in the training set and 169 in the testing 
set. Univariate Cox regression analysis showed that 30 factors associated with 
in-hospital mortality in patients with sepsis complicated with acute pulmonary 
embolism. Through stepwise bi-directional regression, 12 variables were 
ultimately selected, including gender, presence of malignant tumors, body 
temperature, red cell distribution width (RDW), blood urea nitrogen (BUN), serum 
potassium, prothrombin time (PT), 24-hour urine output, mechanical ventilation, 
vasoactive drugs, warfarin use, and sepsis-induced coagulopathy (SIC). 
Collinearity testing indicated no strong multicollinearity among the influencing 
factors [all variance inflation factor (VIF) > 10]. A nomogram model was 
constructed using the 12 variables mentioned above. The nomogram model predicted 
the C-index and its 95% confidence interval (95%CI) of in-hospital mortality in 
patients with sepsis complicated with acute pulmonary embolism better than SOFA 
score and sPESI [0.771 (0.725-0.816) vs. 0.579 (0.519-0.639), 0.608 
(0.554-0.663)]. The ROC curve showed that the area under the curve (AUC) and its 
95%CI of the nomogram model were higher than those of the SOFA score and sPESI 
[0.811 (0.766-0.857) vs. 0.630 (0.568-0.691), 0.623 (0.566-0.680)]. These 
findings were consistently replicated in the internal validation of the testing 
set. In both the training and testing sets, Delong's test showed that the AUC of 
the nomogram model was significantly higher than the SOFA score and sPESI (both 
P < 0.05).
CONCLUSION: The nomogram model demonstrated good predictive effectiveness for 
the risk of in-hospital mortality in patients with sepsis complicated with acute 
pulmonary embolism, enabling clinicians to predict mortality risk in advance and 
take timely interventions to reduce mortality.

BACKGROUND: Neutrophil percentage to albumin ratio (NPAR) has been shown to be 
correlated with the prognosis of various diseases. This study aimed to explore 
the effect of NPAR on the prognosis of patients in coronary care units (CCU).
METHOD: All data in this study were extracted from the Medical Information Mart 
for Intensive Care III (MIMIC-III, version1.4) database. All patients were 
divided into four groups according to their NPAR quartiles. The primary outcome 
was in-hospital mortality. Secondary outcomes were 30-day mortality, 365-day 
mortality, length of CCU stay, length of hospital stay, acute kidney injury 
(AKI), and continuous renal replacement therapy (CRRT). A multivariate binary 
logistic regression analysis was performed to confirm the independent effects of 
NPAR. Cox regression analysis was performed to analyze the association between 
NPAR and 365-day mortality. The curve in line with overall trend was drawn by 
local weighted regression (Lowess). Subgroup analysis was used to determine the 
effect of NPAR on in-hospital mortality in different subgroups. Receiver 
operating characteristic (ROC) curves were used to evaluate the ability of NPAR 
to predict in-hospital mortality. Kaplan-Meier curves were constructed to 
compare the cumulative survival rates among different groups.
RESULT: A total of 2364 patients in CCU were enrolled in this study. The 
in-hospital mortality rate increased significantly as the NPAR quartiles 
increased (p  <  0.001). In multivariate logistic regression analysis, NPAR was 
independently associated with in-hospital mortality (quartile 4 versus quartile 
1: odds ratio [OR], 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.83, 1.20-2.79, p = 0.005, p 
for trend  <  0.001). In Cox regression analysis, NPAR was independently 
associated with 365-day mortality (quartile 4 versus quartile 1: OR, 95% CI: 
1.62, 1.16-2.28, p = 0.005, p for trend  <  0.001). The Lowess curves showed a 
positive relationship between NPAR and in-hospital mortality. The moderate 
ability of NPAR to predict in-hospital mortality was demonstrated through ROC 
curves. The area under the curves (AUC) of NPAR was 0.653 (p  <  0.001), which 
is better than that of the platelet to lymphocyte ratio (PLR) (p  <  0.001) and 
neutrophil count (p  <  0.001) but lower than the Sequential Organ Failure 
Assessment (p = 0.046) and Simplified Acute Physiology Score II (p  <  0.001). 
Subgroup analysis did not reveal any obvious interactions in most subgroups. 
However, Kaplan-Meier curves showed that as NPAR quartiles increased, the 30-day 
(log-rank, p  <  0.001) and 365-day (log-rank, p  <  0.001) cumulative survival 
rates decreased significantly. NPAR was also independently associated with AKI 
(quartile 4 versus quartile 1: OR, 95% CI: 1.57, 1.19-2.07, p = 0.002, p for 
trend = 0.001). The CCU and hospital stay length was significantly prolonged in 
the higher NPAR quartiles.
CONCLUSIONS: NPAR is an independent risk factor for in-hospital mortality in 
patients in CCU and has a moderate ability to predict in-hospital mortality.

This study evaluated the association and prognostic significance of the systemic 
inflammation response index (SIRI) with mortality in sepsis. In this cohort 
study, the sepsis patients were retrieved from the Medical Information Mart for 
Intensive Care III (MIMIC-III) and MIMIC-IV intensive care unit (ICU) databases. 
SIRI was calculated by using the neutrophil, monocyte, and lymphocyte counts. 
The outcomes were 28-day mortality, 1-year mortality, and 28 days to 1-year 
mortality. The Cox proportional hazards model with a hazard ratio (HR) and a 95% 
confidence interval (CI) was used to investigate the association and prognostic 
value of SIRI with mortality in sepsis. Subgroup analyses of the associations of 
SIRI with 28-day and 1-year mortality in sepsis were based on age, gender, 
Simplified Acute Physiology Score II (SAPSII), Sequential Organ Failure 
Assessment (SOFA), and presence or absence of septic shock. The receiver 
operating characteristic (ROC) curve was used to compare the predictive 
performances of SIRI, SOFA and SAPS II for mortality in sepsis. Of the 4239 
patients included, 1339 patients suffered from 28-day mortality, 2085 patients 
suffering from 1-year mortality, and 746 (25.72%) suffered from 28 days to 
1-year mortality. High SIRI levels exhibited higher risks of 28-day mortality 
(HR: 1.15, 95% CI: 1.03-1.29, P = .010), 1-year mortality (HR: 1.14, 95% CI: 
1.04-1.24, P = .003), and 28 days to 1-year mortality (HR: 1.16, 95% CI: 
1.01-1.35, P = .047) in sepsis. A higher SIRI was reported related to 28-day 
mortality and 1-year mortality in sepsis patients with female gender, with SOFA 
< 8, with SAPS II < 44, and in sepsis patients without sepsis shock. The AUC of 
SIRS, SOFA, and SAPS II in predicting 28-day mortality in sepsis were 0.726, 
0.591, and 0.644, respectively. The AUC of SIRI in predicting 1-year mortality 
in sepsis was 0.761, higher than the AUC values of SOFA and SAPS II. A higher 
AUC value of SIRI compared with SOFA, and SAPS II in predicting 28 days to 
1-year mortality was observed. Elevated SIRI was associated with an increased 
risk of mortality in sepsis. SIRI is an independent prognostic biomarker of 
mortality in sepsis.

BACKGROUND: Frailty correlates with adverse outcomes in many cardiovascular 
diseases and is prevalent in individuals with heart failure (HF). The Hospital 
Frailty Risk Score (HFRS) offers an integrated, validated solution for frailty 
assessment in acute care settings, but its application in critically ill 
patients with congestive HF lacks exploration. This study aimed to identify the 
association between frailty assessed by the HFRS and in-hospital mortality in 
critically ill patients with congestive HF.
METHODS: This observational study retrospectively enrolled 12,179 critically ill 
patients with congestive HF. Data from the Medical Information Mart for 
Intensive Care IV database was used. The HFRS was calculated to assess frailty. 
Patients were categorized into three groups: non-frailty (HFRS < 5, n = 7,961), 
pre-frailty (5 ≤ HFRS < 15, n = 3,684), and frailty (HFRS ≥ 15, n = 534). 
Outcomes included in-hospital mortality, length of intensive care unit stay, and 
length of hospital stay. Multiple logistic regression and Locally Weighted 
Scatterplot Smoothing (LOWESS) smoother were used to investigate the association 
between frailty and outcomes. Subgroup analysis was employed to elucidate the 
correlation between frailty levels and in-hospital mortality across diverse 
subgroups.
RESULTS: 12,179 patients were enrolled, 6,679 (54.8%) were male, and the average 
age was 71.05 ± 13.94 years. The overall in-hospital mortality was 11.7%. 
In-hospital mortality increased with the escalation of frailty levels 
(non-frailty vs. pre-frailty vs. frailty: 9.7% vs. 14.8% vs. 20.2%, P < 0.001). 
The LOWESS curve demonstrated that the HFRS was monotonically positively 
correlated with in-hospital mortality. Upon controlling for potential 
confounders, both pre-frailty and frailty statuses were found to be 
independently linked to a heightened risk of mortality during hospitalization 
(odds ratio [95% confidence interval]: pre-frailty vs. non-frailty: 1.27 
[1.10-1.47], P = 0.001; frailty vs. non-frailty: 1.40 [1.07-1.83], P = 0.015; P 
for trend < 0.001). Significant interactions between frailty levels and 
in-hospital mortality were observed in the following subgroups: race, heart 
rate, creatinine, antiplatelet drug, diabetes, cerebrovascular disease, chronic 
renal disease, and sepsis.
CONCLUSION: In critically ill patients with congestive HF, frailty as assessed 
by the HFRS emerged as an independent predictor for the risk of in-hospital 
mortality. Prospective, randomized studies are required to determine whether 
improvement of frailty levels could improve clinical prognosis.

Background: An early net ultrafiltration (NUF) rate may be associated with 
prognosis in patients receiving continuous kidney replacement therapy (CKRT). In 
this study, we tested whether high or low early NUF rates in patients treated 
with CKRT were associated with increased mortality. Methods: We conducted a 
retrospective, observational study among all patients in the Medical Information 
Mart for Intensive Care IV database who received CKRT for more than 24 h within 
14 days after intensive care unit admission. We defined the early (initial 48 h) 
NUF rate as the amount of fluid removal per hour adjusted by the patients' 
weight and took it as a classified variable (low rate: <1.6, moderate rate: 
1.6-3.1 and high rate: > 3.1 ml/kg/h). The association between 28-day mortality 
and the NUF rate was analyzed by logistic regression and mediation analyses. 
Results: A total of 911 patients were included in our study. The median NUF rate 
was 2.71 (interquartile range 1.90-3.86) ml/kg/h and the 28-day mortality was 
40.1%. Compared with the moderate NUF rate, the low NUF rate (adjusted odds 
ratio 1.56, 95% CI 1.04-2.35, p = 0.032) and high NUF rate (adjusted odds ratio 
1.43, 95% CI 1.02-2.01, p = 0.040) were associated with higher 28-day mortality. 
The putative effect of high or low NUF rates on 28 day mortality was not direct 
[adjusted average direct effects (ADE) for a low NUF rate = 0.92, p = 0.064; 
adjusted ADE for a high NUF rate = 1.03, p = 0.096], but mediated by effects of 
the NUF rate on fluid balance during the same period [adjusted average causal 
mediation effects (ACME) 0.96, p = 0.010 for a low NUF rate; adjusted ACME 0.99, 
p = 0.042 for a high NUF rate]. Moreover, we found an increase trend in the NUF 
rate corresponding to the lowest mortality when fluid input increased. 
Conclusion: Compared with NUF rates between 1.6-3.1 ml/kg/h in the first 48 h of 
CKRT, NUF rates > 3.1 and <1.6 ml/kg/h were associated with higher mortality.

BACKGROUND: Triglyceride-glucose (TyG) index as a reliable surrogate of insulin 
resistance (IR) has been shown to be related to adverse clinical outcomes in 
patients with acute coronary syndrome, heart failure, ischemic stroke and so on. 
However, the relationship between TyG index and all-cause mortality in intensive 
care unit (ICU) patients remains unknown. The purpose of this study was to 
investigate the correlation between TyG index and all-cause mortality to 
evaluate the impact of IR on the prognosis of this population.
METHODS: This was a retrospective observational study that included 3026 
patients who had an initial triglyceride and glucose data on the first day of 
ICU admission, and all data were extracted from the Medical Information Mart for 
Intensive Care III (MIMIC-III) database. These patients were grouped into 
quartiles (Q1-Q4) according to TyG index. The Kaplan-Meier analysis was used to 
compare all-cause mortality among the above four groups. Cox proportional 
hazards analyses were performed to examine the association between TyG index and 
all-cause mortality.
RESULTS: During 10.46 years of follow-up, 1148 (37.9%) patients died, of which 
350 (11.6%) occurred during the hospital stay and 258 (8.5%) occurred during the 
ICU stay. Kaplan-Meier analysis showed that the risk of all-cause mortality was 
significantly higher in patients with higher TyG index (log-rank P = 0.021). 
Multivariable Cox proportional hazards analyses showed that the TyG index was an 
independent risk predictor of ICU death (HR: 1.72, 95% CI 1.18-2.52, P = 0.005) 
and hospital death (HR: 2.19, 95% CI 1.59-3.03, P < 0.001), and each 1-unit 
increased in the TyG index, a 1.19-fold increase in the risk of death during the 
hospital stay.
CONCLUSIONS: TyG index is strongly related to the all-cause mortality increasing 
in critically ill patients. This finding indicates that the TyG index might be 
useful in identifying people at high risk of ICU death and hospital death.

BACKGROUND: Hip fracture is a prevalent and hazardous injury among the elderly 
population that often results in intensive care unit (ICU) admission due to 
various complications, despite advanced medical science. One common complication 
experienced in the ICU by elderly hip fracture patients is heart failure, which 
significantly impacts short-term survival rates. Currently, there is a deficit 
of adequate predictive models to forecast the short-term risk of death following 
heart failure for elderly hip fracture patients in the ICU. This study aims to 
identify independent risk factors for all-cause mortality within 30 days for 
elderly patients with hip fractures and heart failure while in the ICU in order 
to develop a predictive model.
METHOD: A total of 641 elderly patients with hip fractures combined with heart 
failure were recruited from the Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care IV 
dataset and randomized to the training and validation sets. The primary outcome 
was all-cause mortality within 30 days. The least absolute shrinkage and 
selection operator regression was used to reduce data dimensionality and select 
features. Multivariate logistic regression was used to build predictive models. 
Consistency index (C-index), receiver operating characteristic curve, and 
decision curve analysis (DCA) were used to measure the predictive performance of 
the nomogram.
RESULT: Our results showed that these variables including MCH, MCV, INR, 
monocyte percentage, neutrophils percentage, creatinine, and combined sepsis 
were independent factors for death within 30 days in elderly patients with hip 
fracture combined with heart failure in the ICU. The C-index was 0.869 (95% CI 
0.823-0.916) and 0.824 (95% CI 0.749-0.900) for the training and validation 
sets, respectively. The results of the area under the curve and decision curve 
analysis (DCA) confirmed that the nomogram performed well in predicting elderly 
patients with hip fractures combined with heart failure in the ICU.
CONCLUSION: We developed a new nomogram model for predicting 30-day all-cause 
mortality in elderly patients with hip fractures combined with heart failure in 
the ICU, which could be a valid and useful clinical tool for clinicians for 
targeted treatment and prognosis prediction.

Objective: The quick sequential organ failure assessment (qSOFA) score has been 
proposed as part of diagnostic criteria for sepsis, but there might be an 
underestimation of the incidence of qSOFA-negative sepsis according to a few 
recent studies. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the value of Oxford 
acute severity of illness score (OASIS) in identifying qSOFA-negative (qSOFA<2) 
patients with sepsis. Methods: Sepsis patients with negative qSOFA scores were 
selected from the Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care Ⅲ(MIMIC-Ⅲ), a 
database comprising de-identified health-related data from patients staying in 
the critical care units of Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center between 2001 and 
2012. Non-infectious patients with both qSOFA and SOFA scores less than 2 were 
enrolled as controls. Propensity score matching (PSM) analysis was used to 
reduce the effects of selection bias. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) 
curve analysis was performed to assess the value of OASIS in discriminating 
qSOFA-negative patients with sepsis and to determine its optimal cut-off. 
Associations of OASIS with 28-day mortality after intensive care unit (ICU) 
admission, ICU mortality, and hospital mortality were further examined using 
multivariate Cox regression and multivariate logistic regression analysis. 
Results: 2 273 qSOFA-negative patients with sepsis and 3 342 non-sepsis controls 
were included finally with a PSM cohort consisted of 1 677 sepsis patients and 1 
677 controls. Results of ROC analysis showed that the area under ROC curve was 
0.753 [95% confidence interval (CI) 0.741-0.765] and the optimal OASIS threshold 
according to the Youden index was 26.5 and yielded a 67.2% sensitivity and 70.8% 
specificity. Multivariate regression analysis indicated that OASIS>26 was an 
independent risk factor for 28-day mortality (hazard ratio 2.80, 95% CI 
2.15-3.65, P<0.01), ICU mortality (odds ratio 4.69, 95% CI 2.60-8.49, P<0.01), 
and hospital mortality (odds ratio 4.48, 95% CI 3.13-6.42, P<0.01). Analysis of 
the PSM cohort presented consistent results. Conclusions: OASIS had a good 
discriminative value to differentiate qSOFA-negative patients with sepsis from 
those without sepsis.

方法：从存储了美国贝斯以色列迪康医学中心重症监护室2001年至2012年住院患者医疗信息的监护室医学信息数据集(MIMIC-Ⅲ)中选取qSOFA阴性的脓毒症患者，同时筛选qSOFA<2、无可疑感染且SOFA<2的其他患者作为对照，并构建倾向性评分匹配队列以减少选择偏倚，运用ROC曲线分析OASIS鉴别qSOFA阴性脓毒症患者的价值并确定其阈值，进一步运用多因素Cox回归、logistic回归分析基于该阈值的OASIS水平与研究对象临床结局的关联。 
结果： 2 273例qSOFA阴性脓毒症患者与3 342例作为对照的非脓毒症患者纳入最终分析，其中1 
677对患者成功匹配。受试者工作特征曲线(ROC曲线)分析结果显示，OASIS鉴别qSOFA阴性脓毒症患者的曲线下面积为0.753(95%CI为0.741～0.765)，Youden指数法确定的阈值为26.5，相应的敏感度为67.2%，特异度为70.8%。多因素回归分析显示，OASIS>26分别是患者28 
d死亡(风险比为2.80，95%CI为2.15～3.65，P<0.01)、ICU内死亡(比值比为4.69，95%CI为2.60～8.49，P<0.01)以及院内死亡(比值比为4.48，95%CI为3.13～6.42，P<0.01)的独立危险因素。对匹配队列的分析结果亦类似。 
结论： OASIS对qSOFA阴性脓毒症患者具有较高的鉴别能力。.

BACKGROUND: Both blood urea nitrogen (BUN) and creatinine (Cr) are indicators of 
kidney function, and the BUN/Cr ratio has been identified as an independent 
prognostic marker for adverse outcomes in critically ill patients with various 
conditions. However, the relationship between the BUN/Cr ratio and long-term 
mortality in critically ill patients with acute pancreatitis (AP) remains 
unclear. Hence, the primary objective of this study was to determine the 
prognostic value of the BUN/Cr ratio in patients with AP.
METHODS: We conducted a retrospective cohort study using data from the Medical 
Information Mart for Intensive Care IV (MIMIC-IV) database. The primary exposure 
variable was the BUN/Cr ratio at intensive care unit (ICU) admission, and the 
primary outcome was 365-day all-cause mortality. Kaplan-Meier analyses and 
multivariate Cox proportional hazards models were used to assess this 
relationship, while restricted cubic spline (RCS) was used to explore potential 
non-linear associations. In addition, subgroup analyses were conducted to assess 
consistency between groups.
RESULTS: A total of 850 critically ill patients with AP were included, with a 
mean age of 59.61 years, 58.59% male, and an overall 365-day mortality rate of 
20.94%. Patients in the highest BUN/Cr quartile had significantly higher 
mortality rates compared to those in lower quartiles. Multivariate Cox 
regression analysis demonstrated that, even after adjusting for potential 
confounders, an elevated BUN/Cr ratio remained an independent predictor of 
increased 28-day and 365-day mortality. RCS analysis confirmed a J-shaped 
relationship between the BUN/Cr ratio and 28-day and 365-day mortality, with a 
sharp increase in the risk of death above the 16.80 threshold. Subgroup analysis 
indicated that this association was consistent across various patient 
characteristics.
CONCLUSION: This study identified a non-linear relationship between the BUN/Cr 
ratio and 365-day mortality in critically ill patients with AP, suggesting that 
the BUN/Cr ratio may serve as an easily accessible, cost-effective, and accurate 
prognostic marker for this population.

BACKGROUND: To develop a scoring system related to the lactate clearance (ΔLA) 
to predict the mortality risk (MELD-ΔLA) for critically ill cirrhotic patients.
METHODS: In this retrospective cohort study, 881 critically ill cirrhotic 
patients from the Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care (MIMIC-III) 
database were included eventually. The outcomes of our study were defined as ICU 
death, 28-day, 90-day and 1-year mortality. Predictors were identified by 
multivariate Cox analysis to develop the predictive scoring system. The C-index 
and area under the curve (AUC) of receiver operator characteristic curve (ROC) 
were used to identify the predicting performance of the MELD-ΔLA, sequential 
organ failure assessment (SOFA), chronic liver failure-sequential organ failure 
assessment (CLIF-SOFA), the model for end-stage liver disease (MELD), 
Child-Pugh, chronic liver failure consortium acute-on-chronic liver failure 
(CLIF-C ACLF), chronic liver failure consortium-acute decompensation (CLIF-C AD) 
and MELD-Na scoring systems. Additionally, subgroup analysis was also performed 
based on whether critically ill cirrhotic patients underwent liver 
transplantation.
RESULTS: Creatinine, bilirubin, international normalized ratio (INR), lactate 
first, ΔLA and vasopressors were closely associated with ICU death of liver 
critically ill cirrhotic patients. The C-index of the MELD-ΔLA in ICU death was 
0.768 (95% CI 0.736-0.799) and the AUC for the MELD-ΔLA scoring system in 
predicting 28-day, 90-day, and 1-year mortality were 0.774 (95% CI 0.743-0.804), 
0.765 (95% CI 0.735-0.796), and 0.757 (95% CI 0.726-0.788), suggested that 
MELD-ΔLA scoring system has a good predictive value than SOFA, CLIF-SOFA, MELD, 
Child-Pugh, CLIF-C ACLF, CLIF-C AD) and MELD-Na scoring systems. Additionally, 
the study also confirmed the good predictive value of MELD-ΔLA scoring system 
for critically ill cirrhotic patients regardless of undergoing liver 
transplantation.
CONCLUSION: The developed MELD-ΔLA score is a simple scoring system in 
predicting the risk of ICU death, 28-day, 90-day and 1-year mortality for 
critically ill cirrhotic patients, which may have a good predictive performance.

BACKGROUND: Liver failure has a high mortality rate, and currently, there is no 
convenient risk predictor. The lactate-to-albumin ratio (LAR) has emerged as a 
promising predictor in various critical illnesses. However, its potential role 
in predicting all-cause mortality in patients with liver failure remains 
unexplored. Therefore, this study aims to investigate the correlation between 
LAR and all-cause mortality in patients suffering from liver failure.
METHODS: We retrospectively analyzed data from patients with liver failure who 
were admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) between 2008 and 2019, which were 
gathered from the Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care IV (MIMIC-IV) 
database. LAR was calculated from the ratio obtained from the first measurement 
taken within 24 h of admission. The optimal LAR threshold was determined using 
the Youden index. With LAR categorized into low, middle, and high groups based 
on tertiles, Kaplan - Meier analysis was employed to compare mortality risks 
among three patient groups. Multivariate Cox proportional hazards regression 
models were utilized to evaluate the association between LAR and all-cause 
mortality in hepatic failure patients within hospital admission. Additionally, 
receiver operating characteristic (ROC) and smoothing curve analysis were used 
to assess the predictive ability, sensitivity, and specificity of LAR for 
all-cause mortality in patients with liver failure, and the area under the curve 
(AUC) was calculated. A smooth curve fitting approach and threshold effect 
analysis were employed to detect the potentially non-linear relationship between 
the LAR and the risk of all-cause mortality in patients with hepatic failure. 
Finally, subgroup analyses were performed to assess the relationship between LAR 
and prognosis across different types of liver failure.
RESULTS: A total of 902 patients with hepatic failure were included in this 
study. They were divided into survivors group (611 patients) and non-survivors 
group (291 patients) according to whether they survived during hospitalization, 
and the mortality rate of patients was 32.26%. The Kaplan-Meier survival curves 
illustrating patients in hepatic failure with elevated LAR showed a 
significantly heightened risk of in-hospital mortality (P < 0.001). We 
identified a non-linear relationship between LAR and the risk of hospital 
mortality after adjusting for potential confounders and the inflection point of 
LAR to be 1.33. LAR was shown to be an independent predictor of all-cause 
mortality within hospitalization in patients with hepatic failure by 
multivariate COX regression analysis (HR, 1.66; 95% CI, 1.35-2.05; P < 0.0001). 
The optimal cutoff value for separating the survival and death groups according 
to ROC was found to be 0.97. The AUC value for LAR was 0.755 (95% CI: 0.721, 
0.789), which was higher than that for arterial blood lactate (AUC = 0.725) and 
serum albumin (AUC = 0.680) alone. It was not inferior even when compared to 
MELD (AUC = 0.677).
CONCLUSION: LAR has demonstrated good predictive value for all-cause mortality 
among liver failure patients in our retrospective study.

BACKGROUND: The effects of diastolic arterial pressure (DAP) and heart rate (HR) 
on the prognosis of patients with septic shock are unclear, and whether these 
effects persist over time is unknown. We aimed to investigate the relationship 
between exposure to different intensities of DAP and HR over time and mortality 
at 28 days in patients with septic shock.
METHODS: In this cohort study, we obtained data from the Medical Information 
Mart for Intensive Care IV, which includes the data of adult patients 
(≥ 18 years) with septic shock who underwent invasive blood pressure monitoring. 
We excluded patients who received extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) or 
glucocorticoids within 48 h of ICU admission. The primary outcome was mortality 
at 28 days. Piece-wise exponential additive mixed models were used to estimate 
the strength of the associations over time.
RESULTS: In total, 4959 patients were finally included. The median length of 
stay in the ICU was 3.2 days (IQR: 1.5-7.1 days), and the mortality in the ICU 
was 12.9%, with a total mortality at 28 days of 15.9%. After adjustment for 
baseline and time-dependent confounders, both daily time-weighted average (TWA) 
DAP and HR were associated with increased mortality at 28 days and strong 
association, mainly in the early to mid-stages of the disease. The results 
showed that mortality in patients with septic shock was lowest at a DAP of 
50-70 mm Hg and an HR of 60-90 beats per minute (bpm). Throughout, a significant 
increase in the risk of death was found with daily exposure to TWA-DAP ≤ 40 mmHg 
(hazard ratio 0.99, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.94-1.03) or TWA-HR ≥ 100 bpm 
(hazard ratio 1.16, 95% CI 1.1-1.21). Cumulative and interactive effects of 
harmful exposure (TWA-DAP ≤ 40 mmHg and TWA-HR ≥ 100 bpm) were also observed.
CONCLUSION: The optimal ranges for DAP and HR in patients with septic shock are 
50-70 mmHg and 60-90 bpm, respectively. The cumulative and interactive effects 
of exposure to low DAP (≤ 40 mmHg) and tachycardia (≥ 100 bpm) were associated 
with an increased risk of death.

BACKGROUND: To develop a prediction model predicting in-hospital mortality of 
elder patients with community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) admitted to the intensive 
care unit (ICU).
METHODS: In this cohort study, data of 619 patients with CAP aged ≥ 65 years 
were obtained from the Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care III (MIMIC 
III) 2001-2012 database. To establish the robustness of predictor variables, the 
sample dataset was randomly partitioned into a training set group and a testing 
set group (ratio: 6.5:3.5). The predictive factors were evaluated using 
multivariable logistic regression, and then a prediction model was constructed. 
The prediction model was compared with the widely used assessments: Sequential 
Organ Failure Assessment (SOFA), Pneumonia Severity Index (PSI), systolic blood 
pressure, oxygenation, age and respiratory rate (SOAR), CURB-65 scores using 
positive predictive value (PPV), negative predictive value (NPV), accuracy 
(ACC), area under the curve (AUC) and 95% confidence interval (CI). The decision 
curve analysis (DCA) was used to assess the net benefit of the prediction model. 
Subgroup analysis based on the pathogen was developed.
RESULTS: Among 402 patients in the training set, 90 (24.63%) elderly CAP 
patients suffered from 30-day in-hospital mortality, with the median follow-up 
being 8 days. Hemoglobin/platelets ratio, age, respiratory rate, international 
normalized ratio, ventilation use, vasopressor use, red cell distribution 
width/blood urea nitrogen ratio, and Glasgow coma scales were identified as the 
predictive factors that affect the 30-day in-hospital mortality. The AUC values 
of the prediction model, the SOFA, SOAR, PSI and CURB-65 scores, were 0.751 (95% 
CI 0.749-0.752), 0.672 (95% CI 0.670-0.674), 0.607 (95% CI 0.605-0.609), 0.538 
(95% CI 0.536-0.540), and 0.645 (95% CI 0.643-0.646), respectively. DCA result 
demonstrated that the prediction model could provide greater clinical net 
benefits to CAP patients admitted to the ICU. Concerning the pathogen, the 
prediction model also reported better predictive performance.
CONCLUSION: Our prediction model could predict the 30-day hospital mortality in 
elder patients with CAP and guide clinicians to identify the high-risk 
population.

BACKGROUND: The stress hyperglycemia ratio (SHR) was developed to reduce the 
effects of long-term chronic glycemic factors on stress hyperglycemia levels, 
which was associated with adverse clinical outcomes. This study aims to evaluate 
the relationship between the postoperative SHR index and all-cause mortality in 
patients undergoing cardiac surgery.
METHODS: Data for this study were extracted from the Medical Information Mart 
for Intensive Care IV (MIMIC-IV) database. Patients were categorized into four 
groups based on postoperative SHR index quartiles. The primary outcome was 
30-day all-cause mortality, while the secondary outcomes included in-hospital, 
90-day and 360-day all-cause mortality. The SHR index was analyzed using 
quartiles, and Kaplan-Meier curves were generated to compare outcomes across 
groups. Cox proportional hazards regression and restricted cubic splines (RCS) 
were employed to assess the relationship between the SHR index and the outcomes. 
LASSO regression was used for feature selection. Six machine learning algorithms 
were used to predict in-hospital all-cause mortality and were further extended 
to predict 360-day all-cause mortality. The SHapley Additive exPlanations method 
was used for visualizing model characteristics and individual case predictions.
RESULTS: A total of 3,848 participants were included in the study, with a mean 
age of 68 ± 12 years and female participants comprised 30.6% (1,179). Higher 
postoperative SHR index levels were associated with an increased risk of 
in-hospital, 90-day and 360-day all-cause mortality as shown by Kaplan-Meier 
curves (log-rank P < 0.05). Cox regression analysis revealed that the highest 
postoperative SHR quartile was associated with a significantly higher risk of 
mortality at these time points (P < 0.05). RCS analysis demonstrated nonlinear 
relationships between the postoperative SHR index and all-cause mortality (P for 
nonlinear < 0.05). The Naive Bayes model achieves the highest area under the 
curve (AUC) for predicting both in-hospital mortality (0.7936) and 360-day 
all-cause mortality (0.7410).
CONCLUSION: In patients undergoing cardiac surgery, higher postoperative SHR 
index levels were significantly associated with increased risk of in-hospital, 
90-day and 360-day all-cause mortality. The SHR index may serve as a valid tool 
for assessing the severity after cardiac surgery and guiding treatment 
decisions.

BACKGROUND: An index of dynamic lactate change that incorporates both the 
magnitude of change and the time interval of such change, termed "normalized 
lactate load," may reflect the hypoxic burden of septic shock. We aimed to 
evaluate the association between normalized lactate load and 28-day mortality in 
adult septic shock patients.
METHODS: Patients with septic shock were identified from the Medical Information 
Mart for Intensive Care (MIMIC)-III database. Lactate load was defined as the 
sum of the area under the curve (AUC) of serial lactate levels using the 
trapezoidal rule, and normalized lactate load was defined as the lactate load 
divided by time. Receiver-operating characteristic curves were constructed to 
determine the performance of initial lactate, maximum lactate and normalized 
lactate load in predicting 28-day mortality.
RESULTS: A total of 1371 septic shock patients were included, and the 28-day 
mortality was 39.8%. Non-survivors had significantly higher initial lactate 
(means ± standard deviations: 3.9 ± 2.9 vs. 2.8 ± 1.7 mmol/L), maximum lactate 
(5.8 ± 3.8 vs. 4.3 ± 2.2 mmol/L), lactate load (94.3 ± 71.8 vs. 
61.1 ± 36.4 mmol·hr./L) and normalized lactate load (3.9 ± 3.0 vs. 
2.5 ± 1.5 mmol/L, all p <  0.001). The AUCs of initial lactate, maximum lactate 
and normalized lactate load were 0.623 (95% confidence interval: 0.596-0.648, 
with a cut-off value of 4.4 mmol/L), 0.606 (0.580-0.632, with a cut-off value of 
2.6 mmol/L) and 0.681 (0.656-0.706, with a cut-off value of 2.6 mmol/L), 
respectively. The AUC of normalized lactate load was significantly greater than 
both initial lactate and maximum lactate (all p <  0.001). In the multivariate 
logistic regression model, normalized lactate load was identified as an 
independent risk factor for 28-day mortality.
CONCLUSIONS: Normalized lactate load is an independent risk factor for 28-day 
mortality in adult septic shock patients. Normalized lactate load had better 
accuracy than both initial and maximum lactate in determining the prognosis of 
septic shock patients.

PURPOSE: Acute kidney injury (AKI) is a common complication of acute 
exacerbation of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (AECOPD), and inflammation 
is the potential link between AKI and AECOPD. However, little is known about the 
incidence and risk stratification of AKI in critically ill AECOPD patients. In 
this study, we aimed to establish risk model based on white blood cell 
(WBC)-related indicators to predict AKI in critically ill AECOPD patients.
MATERIAL AND METHODS: For the training cohort, data were taken from the Medical 
Information Mart for eICU Collaborative Research Database (eICU-CRD) database, 
and for the validation cohort, data were taken from the Medical Information Mart 
for Intensive Care-IV (MIMIC-IV) database. The study employed logistic 
regression analysis to identify the major predictors of WBC-related biomarkers 
on AKI prediction. Subsequently, a risk model was developed by multivariate 
logistic regression, utilizing the identified significant indicators.
RESULTS: Finally, 3551 patients were enrolled in training cohort, 926 patients 
were enrolled in validation cohort. AKI occurred in 1206 (33.4%) patients in 
training cohort and 521 (56.3%) patients in validation cohort. According to the 
multivariate logistic regression analysis, four WBC-related indicators were 
finally included in the novel risk model, and the risk model had a relatively 
good accuracy for AKI in the training set (C-index, 0.764, 95% CI 0.749-0.780) 
as well as in the validation set (C-index, 0.738, 95% CI: 0.706-0.770). Even 
after accounting for other models, the critically ill AECOPD patients in the 
high-risk group (risk score > 3.44) still showed an increased risk of AKI (odds 
ratio: 4.74, 95% CI: 4.07-5.54) compared to those in low-risk group (risk score 
≤ 3.44). Moreover, the risk model showed outstanding calibration capability as 
well as therapeutic usefulness in both groups for AKI and ICU mortality and 
in-hospital mortality of critical ill AECOPD patients.
CONCLUSION: The novel risk model showed good AKI prediction performance. This 
risk model has certain reference value for the risk stratification of AECOPD 
complicated with AKI in clinically.

BACKGROUND: High Neutrophil-to-Lymphocyte Ratio (NLR), Monocyte-to-Lymphocyte 
Ratio (MLR), Platelet-to-Lymphocyte Ratio (PLR) were associated with worse 
prognosis of patients with sepsis. In-hospital mortality has been reported to be 
higher in patients with coronary artery disease (CAD) and sepsis than those with 
sepsis alone. However, the relationship between NLR, MLR, PLR and mortality in 
septic patients with coronary artery disease (CAD) remains unclear. The study 
aimed to explore the association between NLR, MLR, PLR and 28-day all-cause 
mortality in septic patients with CAD.
METHODS: We performed an observational cohort study of septic patients with CAD 
from the Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care (MIMIC)-IV database between 
2008 and 2019. The patients were categorized by three group (Q1: low levels, Q2: 
medium levels, Q3: high levels) based on tertiles of NLR, MLR, and PLR. The 
associations between NLR, MLR, PLR and 28-day all-cause mortality were examined 
using the Cox proportional hazards model. Subsequently, we applied receiver 
operating characteristic (ROC) analysis for predicting 28-day mortality in 
septic patients with CAD by combining NLR, MLR and PLR with the modified 
sequential organ failure assessment (mSOFA) scores.
RESULTS: Overall 1,175 septic patients with CAD were included in the study. 
Observed all-cause mortality rates in 28 days were 27.1%. Multivariate Cox 
proportional hazards regression analysis results showed that 28-day all-cause 
mortality of septic patients with CAD was significantly related to rising NLR 
levels (adjusted hazard ratio [aHR]: 1.02; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 
1.01-1.02; P < 0.001), MLR levels (aHR: 1.29; 95%CI: 1.18-1.41; P < 0.001), and 
PLR levels (aHR: 1.0007; 95%CI: 1.0004-1.0011; P < 0.001). Meanwhile, the higher 
levels (Q3) group of NLR, MLR, and PLR also had a higher risk of 28-day 
all-cause mortality than the lower (Q1) group. The area under the ROC curve of 
NLR, MLR, PLR, and mSOFA score were 0.630 (95%CI 0.595-0.665), 0.611 (95%CI 
0.576-0.646), 0.601 (95%CI 0.567-0.636) and 0.718 (95%CI 0.689-0.748), 
respectively. Combining NLR, MLR, and PLR with mSOFA scores may improve ability 
of predicting 28-day mortality (AUC: 0.737, 95%CI 0.709-0.766).
CONCLUSION: Higher levels of NLR, MLR and PLR were associated with 28-day 
all-cause mortality in septic patients with CAD. Further investigation will be 
needed to improve understanding of the pathophysiology of this relationship.

BACKGROUND: Hemorrhagic stroke (HS), including non-traumatic intracerebral 
hemorrhage (ICH) and subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH), constitutes a substantial 
proportion of cerebrovascular incidents, accounting for around 30% of stroke 
cases. The triglyceride-glucose index (TyG-i) represents a precise insulin 
resistance (IR) indicator, a crucial metabolic disturbance. Existing literature 
has demonstrated an association between TyG-i and all-cause mortality (ACM) 
among individuals suffering from ischemic stroke (IS). Yet, the TyG-i prognostic 
implications for severe HS patients necessitating intensive care unit (ICU) 
admission are not clearly understood. Considering the notably elevated mortality 
and morbidity associated with HS relative to IS, investigating this association 
is warranted. Our primary aim was to investigate TyG-i and ACM association among 
critically ill HS patients within an ICU context.
METHODS: Herein, patients with severe HS were identified by accessing the 
Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care-IV (MIMIC-IV, version 2.2) database, 
using the International Classification of Diseases (ICD)-9/10 as diagnostic 
guidelines. Subsequently, we stratified the subjects into quartiles, relying on 
their TyG-i scores. Moreover, we measured mortality at ICU, in-hospital, 30 
days, 90 days, and 1 year as the outcomes. Cox proportional hazards regression 
analysis and restricted cubic splines (RCS) were deployed for elucidating the 
relation between the TyG-i and ACM while utilizing the Kaplan-Meier (K-M) method 
to estimate survival curves. The findings' robustness was assessed by conducting 
subgroup analysis and interaction tests employing likelihood ratio tests.
RESULTS: The analysis included 1475 patients, with a male predominance of 54.4%. 
Observed mortality rates in the ICU, hospital, 30 days, 90 days, and 1 year were 
7.3%, 10.9%, 13.8%, 19.7%, and 27.3%, respectively. Multivariate Cox regression 
analysis results manifested that heightened TyG-i was significantly related to 
ACM at 30 days (adjusted hazard ratio [aHR]: 1.32; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 
1.05-1.67; P = 0.020), 90 days (aHR: 1.27; 95% CI: 1.04-1.55; P = 0.019), and 1 
year (aHR: 1.22; 95% CI: 1.03-1.44; P = 0.023). The results of RCS analysis 
demonstrated a progressive elevation in ACM risk with rising TyG-i levels. 
Interaction tests found no significant effect modification in this relationship.
CONCLUSION: In summary, TyG-i exhibits a significant correlation with ACM among 
patients enduring critical illness due to HS. This correlation underscores the 
probable utility of TyG-i as a prognostic tool for stratifying HS patients 
according to their risk of mortality. Applying TyG-i in clinical settings could 
enhance therapeutic decision-making and the management of disease trajectories. 
Additionally, this investigation augments existing research on the linkage 
between the TyG-i and IS, elucidating the TyG-i's role in predicting mortality 
across diverse stroke categories.

Metabolic acidosis is usually associated with the severity of the condition of 
patients with sepsis or septic shock. Serum anion gap (AG) is one of the 
indicators of response metabolism. This study was performed to investigate 
whether the initial serum AG is associated with the 28-day mortality in 
critically ill adult patients with sepsis. This retrospective cohort study, a 
total of 15,047 patients with confirmed Sepsis disease from 2008 to 2019 from 
the Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care IV (MIMIC-IV) v1.0 database. The 
MIMIC-IV database is a comprehensive, de-identified clinical dataset originating 
from the Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center in Boston, it includes extensive 
data on intensive care unit (ICU) patients, such as vital signs, lab results, 
and medication orders, spanning multiple years, accessible to researchers 
through an application process. AG can be obtained by direct extraction in the 
MIMIC-IV database (itemid = 50,868 from the laboratory events table of 
mimic_hosp), inclusion of AG values for the first test on first day of ICU 
admission. The patients were grouped into quartiles according to the AG 
interquartile range. The primary outcome was the 28-day mortality. Multiple 
logistic regression analysis was used to calculate the odds ratio (OR), while 
accounting for potential confounders, and the robustness of the results were 
evaluated in subgroup analyses. Among the 15,047 patients included in this 
study, the average age was 65.9 ± 16.0 years, 42.5% were female, 66.1% were 
Caucasian, and the 28-day mortality rate was 17.9% (2686/15,047). Multiple 
logistic regression analysis revealed the 28-day mortality in every increase of 
AG (per SD mEq/L), there is an associated 1.2 times (OR 1.2, 95% CI 1.12-1.29, 
P < .001) increase. Increased 28-day mortality (OR 1.53, 95% confidence interval 
1.29-1.81, P < .001) in the group with the AG (15-18 mEq/L), and (OR 1.69, 95% 
confidence interval 1.4-2.04, P < .001) in the group with the highest AG (≥18 
mEq/L), AG (<12 mEq/L) as a reference group, in the fully adjusted model. In 
adult patients with sepsis, the early AG at the time of ICU admission is an 
independent risk factor for prognosis.

BACKGROUND: The optimal blood glucose (BG) level for patients with cardiogenic 
shock in the intensive care unit (ICU) remains unclear. Studies have found that 
both excessively high and low BG levels contribute to adverse cardiovascular 
events. Our study aims to investigate the optimal BG level for critically ill 
patients with cardiogenic shock and evaluate the effects of optimal BG on the 
prognosis of patients.
METHODS: A total of 2013 patients with cardiogenic shock obtained from the 
Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care (MIMIC) IV database were included in 
the final cohort for our retrospective observational study for data analysis. 
The exposure was time-weighted average BG (TWA-BG), which was calculated by the 
time-series BG records and corresponding time stamps of patients with 
cardiogenic shock during their stay in the ICU. The cut-off value of TWA-BG was 
identified by the restricted cubic spline curve and included patients were 
categorized into three groups: low TWA-BG group (TWA-BG ≤ 104 mg/dl), optimal 
TWA-BG group (104 < TWA-BG ≤ 138 mg/dl), and high TWA-BG group 
(TWA-BG > 138 mg/dl). The primary outcome was 28-day mortality, and the 
secondary outcomes were ICU and in-hospital mortality. We performed the log-rank 
test to detect whether there is a difference in mortality among different groups 
in the original cohort. Multiple distinct models were employed to validate the 
robustness of the results.
RESULTS: Our study revealed that the optimal BG level for critically ill 
patients with cardiogenic shock is 104-138 mg/dl. Compared to the optimal TWA-BG 
group, the low TWA-BG group (hazard ratio (HR): 1.67, 95% confidence interval 
(CI): 1.19-2.33, p = 0.002) and high TWA-BG group (HR: 1.72, 95% CI: 1.46-2.03, 
p < 0.001) exhibited higher 28-day mortality. Similarly, the low TWA-BG group 
and high TWA-BG group demonstrated higher risks in terms of ICU mortality (low 
TWA-BG group: HR: 2.30, 95% CI: 1.40-3.79, p < 0.001; high TWA-BG group: HR: 
1.77, 95% CI: 1.45-2.17, p < 0.001) and in-hospital mortality (low TWA-BG group: 
HR: 1.73, 95% CI: 1.19-2.51, p = 0.001; high TWA-BG group: HR: 1.64, 95% CI: 
1.38-1.95, p < 0.001). Sensitivity analysis conducted through propensity score 
matching and the subgroup analysis further substantiated the robustness of the 
results.
CONCLUSION: The optimal BG level for patients with cardiogenic shock is 
104-138 mg/dl. BG levels below 104 mg/dl and above 138 mg/dl were associated 
with a less favorable prognosis.

OBJECTIVE: The aim in this study was to stratify maximum blood glucose levels to 
identify the the best cut-off value of glucose levels to predict mortality in 
acute coronary syndrome (ACS) patients, regardless of whether they had diabetes.
DESIGN: A retrospective cohort study.
SETTING: All clinical data were obtained from the 'Medical Information Mart for 
Intensive Care III' database.
PARTICIPANTS: A total of 3078 patients with ACS were included in the study. We 
divided the patients into four levels based on their maximum blood glucose 
levels (glucosemax), then analysed the relationship between each group with 
mortality.
RESULTS: Among enrolled patients, 2780 and 298 were survivors and non-survivors, 
respectively. Blood glucose levels and mortality showed a 'tick' type 
relationship, with levels 3 and 4 found to be closely associated with increased 
hospital mortality (p<0.05), relative to level 1 (<6.1 mmol/L), used as the 
reference group. No significant association was observed in mortality between 
level 2 and level 1 (p=0.095). In addition, we found a gradual increase in OR 
for level 2 (OR: 2.42, 95% CI 0.86 to 6.80, p=0.095), level 3 (OR: 4.33, 95% CI 
1.55 to 12.13, p=0.005) and level 4 (OR: 7.27, 95% CI 2.56 to 20.62, p<0.001), 
relative to level 1. Based on receiver operating characteristic curves, the 
optimal cut-off value for predicting mortality were 11.5 (area under curve 
(AUC)=0.724), 11.2 (AUC=0.729), 13.4 (AUC=0.638), 15.8 (AUC=0.717) and 
11.3 mmol/L (AUC=0.764) in all ACS, acute myocardial infarction, unstable 
angina, diabetes and non-diabetes patients, respectively. The results of 
subgroup analysis suggested that in patients with significantly elevated blood 
glucose, the mortality of non-diabetes was higher than patients with diabetes 
(OR: 0.42, 95% CI 0.31 to 0.57, p<0.001).
CONCLUSION: Overall, glucosemax ≥11.5 mmol/L had a significant association with 
increased mortality in patients with ACS. Non-diabetes ACS patients need a more 
robust blood glucose management strategy compared with diabetes counterparts.

OBJECTIVE: To investigate the value of machine learning methods for predicting 
in-hospital mortality in trauma patients with acute respiratory distress 
syndrome (ARDS).
METHODS: A retrospective non-intervention case-control study was performed. 
Trauma patients with ARDS met the Berlin definition were extracted from the the 
Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care III (MIMIC III) database. The basic 
information [including gender, age, body mass index (BMI), pH, oxygenation 
index, laboratory indexes, length of stay in the intensive care unit (ICU), the 
proportion of mechanical ventilation (MV) or continuous renal replacement 
therapy (CRRT), acute physiology score III (APS III), sequential organ failure 
score (SOFA) and simplified acute physiology score II (SAPS II)], complications 
(including hypertension, diabetes, infection, acute hemorrhagic anemia, sepsis, 
shock, acidosis and pneumonia) and prognosis data of patients were collected. 
Multivariate Logistic regression analysis was used to screen meaningful 
variables (P < 0.05). Logistic regression model, XGBoost model and artificial 
neural network model were constructed, and the receiver operator characteristic 
curve (ROC) was performed to evaluate the predictive value of the three models 
for in-hospital mortality in trauma patients with ARDS.
RESULTS: A total of 760 trauma patients with ARDS were enrolled, including 346 
mild cases, 301 moderate cases and 113 severe cases; 618 cases survived and 142 
cases died in hospital; 736 cases received MV and 65 cases received CRRT. 
Multivariate Logistic regression analysis screened out significant variables, 
including age [odds ratio (OR) = 1.035, 95% confidence interval (95%CI) was 
1.020-1.050, P < 0.001], BMI (OR = 0.949, 95%CI was 0.917-0.983, P = 0.003), 
blood urea nitrogen (BUN; OR = 1.019, 95%CI was 1.004-1.033, P = 0.010), lactic 
acid (Lac; OR = 1.213, 95%CI was 1.124-1.309, P < 0.001), red cell volume 
distribution width (RDW; OR = 1.249, 95%CI was 1.102-1.416, P < 0.001), 
hematocrit (HCT, OR = 1.057, 95%CI was 1.019-1.097, P = 0.003), hypertension (OR 
= 0.614, 95%CI was 0.389-0.968, P = 0.036), infection (OR = 0.463, 95%CI was 
0.289-0.741, P = 0.001), acute renal failure (OR = 2.021, 95%CI was 1.267-3.224, 
P = 0.003) and sepsis (OR = 2.105, 95%CI was 1.265-3.502, P = 0.004). All the 
above variables were used to construct the model. Logistic regression model, 
XGBoost model and artificial neural network model predicted in-hospital 
mortality with area under the curve (AUC) of 0.737 (95%CI was 0.659-0.815), 
0.745 (95%CI was 0.672-0.819) and 0.757 (95%CI was 0.680-0.884), respectively. 
There was no significant difference between any two models (all P > 0.05).
CONCLUSIONS: Logistic regression model, XGBoost model and artificial neural 
network model including age, BMI, BUN, Lac, RDW, HCT, hypertension, infection, 
acute renal failure and sepsis have good predictive value for in-hospital 
mortality of trauma patients with ARDS.

BACKGROUND: The optimal timing of lactate measurement for septic patients in the 
intensive care unit (ICU) remains controversial, and whether initiating and 
repeating the lactate measurement earlier could make a difference for septic 
patients with an elevated lactate level remains unexplored.
METHODS: This was a retrospective observational study that included septic 
patients with an initial lactate level > 2.0 mmol/L after ICU admission, and all 
data were extracted from the Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care III 
(MIMIC-III) database. The main exposure of interest was the early lactate 
measurement, which was defined as an initial lactate level measurement within 
1 h after ICU admission. The primary outcome was 28-day mortality.
RESULTS: A total of 2642 eligible subjects were enrolled, including 738 patients 
who had initial lactate measurements completed within 1 h (EL group) and 1904 
patients who had initial lactate measurements completed more than 1 h after ICU 
admission (LL group). A significant beneficial effect of early lactate 
measurement in terms of 28-day mortality was observed: the adjusted odds ratio 
(OR) was 0.69 (95% CI 0.55-0.87; p = 0.001), and the mediation effect of the 
time to initial vasopressor administration was significant (average causal 
mediation effect (ACME) - 0.018; 95% CI - 0.005 approximately to - 0.036; 
p < 0.001). A strong relationship between delayed initial lactate measurement 
and risk-adjusted 28-day mortality was noted (OR 1.04; 95% CI 1.02-1.05; 
p < 0.001). Each hour of delay in remeasuring the lactate level was associated 
with an increase in 28-day mortality in the EL group (OR 1.09; 95% CI 1.04-1.15; 
p < 0.001). Further analysis demonstrated that repeating the measurement 3 h 
after the initial lactate measurement led to a significant difference.
CONCLUSIONS: Early lactate measurement is associated with a lower risk-adjusted 
28-day mortality rate in septic patients with lactate levels > 2.0 mmol/L. A 
shorter time to the initial vasopressor administration may contribute to this 
relationship. Repeating the lactate measurement within 3 h after the initial 
measurement is appropriate for patients whose lactate levels were measured 
within 1 h of admission.

prognosis of elderly patients diagnosed as sepsis.
METHODS: A retrospective cohort study was conducted. Information on the cases of 
elderly patients with sepsis in the Medical Information Mart for Intensive 
Care-IV (MIMIC-IV), including basic information, blood pressure, routine blood 
test results [the Hb level of a patient was defined as his/her maximum Hb level 
from 6 hours before admission to intensive care unit (ICU) and 24 hours after 
admission to ICU], blood biochemical indexes, coagulation function, vital signs, 
severity score and outcome indicators were extracted. The curves of Hb level vs. 
28-day mortality risk were developed by using the restricted cubic spline model 
based on the Cox regression analysis. The patients were divided into four groups 
(Hb < 100 g/L, 100 g/L ≤ Hb < 130 g/L, 130 g/L ≤ Hb < 150 g/L, Hb ≥ 150 g/L 
groups) based on these curves. The outcome indicators of patients in each group 
were analyzed, and the 28-day Kaplan-Meier survival curve was drawn. Logistic 
regression model and Cox regression model were used to analyze the relationship 
between Hb level and 28-day mortality risk in different groups.
RESULTS: A total of 7 473 elderly patients with sepsis were included. There was 
a "U" curve relationship between Hb levels within 24 hours after ICU admission 
and the risk of 28-day mortality in patients with sepsis. The patients with 100 
g/L ≤ Hb < 130 g/L had a lower risk of 28-day mortality. When Hb level was less 
than 100 g/L, the risk of death decreased gradually with the increase of Hb 
level. When Hb level was ≥ 130 g/L, the risk of death gradually increased with 
the increase of Hb level. Multivariate Logistic regression analysis revealed 
that the mortality risks of patients with Hb < 100 g/L [odds ratio (OR) = 1.44, 
95% confidence interval (95%CI) was 1.23-1.70, P < 0.001] and Hb ≥ 150 g/L (OR = 
1.77, 95%CI was 1.26-2.49, P = 0.001) increased significantly in the model 
involving all confounding factors; the mortality risks of patients with 130 g/L 
≤ Hb < 150 g/L increased, while the difference was not statistically significant 
(OR = 1.21, 95%CI was 0.99-1.48, P = 0.057). The multivariate Cox regression 
analysis suggested that the mortality risks of patients with Hb < 100 g/L 
[hazard ratio (HR) = 1.27, 95%CI was 1.12-1.44, P < 0.001] and Hb ≥ 150 g/L (HR 
= 1.49, 95%CI was 1.16-1.93, P = 0.002) increased significantly in the model 
involving all confounding factors; the mortality risks of patients with 130 g/L 
≤ Hb < 150 g/L increased, while the difference was not statistically significant 
(HR = 1.17, 95%CI was 0.99-1.37, P = 0.053). Kaplan-Meier survival curve showed 
that the 28-day survival rate of elderly septic patients in 100 g/L ≤ Hb < 130 
g/L group was significantly higher than that in Hb < 100 g/L, 130 g/L ≤ Hb < 150 
g/L and Hb ≥ 150 g/L groups (85.26% vs. 77.33%, 79.81%, 74.33%; Log-Rank test: 
χ2 = 71.850, P < 0.001).
CONCLUSIONS: Elderly patients with sepsis exhibited low mortality risk if their 
100 g/L ≤ Hb < 130 g/L within 24 hours after admission to ICU, and both higher 
and lower Hb levels led to increased mortality risks.

BACKGROUND: Delirium is a common complication in intensive care unit (ICU) 
patients, and it can significantly increase the length of hospital stay and 
cost. Dexamethasone is widely used in various inflammatory diseases and must be 
used with caution in critically ill patients. Previous studies have shown that 
the effect of corticosteroid use on the development of delirium in critically 
ill patients is still controversial, and there is inconclusive conclusion about 
the effect of dexamethasone on delirium in such patients. Therefore, this study 
aimed to confirm the effect of dexamethasone use and the dose on the incidence 
of delirium and patient prognosis in critically ill patients through a large 
cohort study.
METHODS: A retrospective cohort study was conducted using data extracted from 
the Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care III database, which is a large 
and freely available database of all 46,476 patients who visited Beth Israel 
Deaconess Medical Center in Boston, Massachusetts, USA and were admitted to the 
ICU between 2001 and 2012. The primary outcome was the development of delirium, 
using multivariate logistic regression analysis to reveal the relationship 
between dexamethasone and delirium. Secondary endpoints were in-hospital 
mortality, ICU mortality, total length of stay, and length of ICU stay, and the 
relationship between dexamethasone and prognosis was assessed with Cox 
proportional hazards models. Propensity score matching with 1:1 grouping was 
used to eliminate the effect of confounders on both cohorts. The locally 
weighted scatter plot smoothing technique was used to investigate the dose 
correlation between dexamethasone and outcomes, subgroup analysis was used to 
account for heterogeneity, and different correction models and propensity 
matching analysis were used to eliminate potential confounders.
RESULTS: Finally, 38,509 patients were included, and 2204 (5.7%) used 
dexamethasone. No significant statistical difference was observed in basic 
demographic information after propensity score matching between the two study 
groups. A significantly higher incidence of delirium (5.0% versus 3.4%, 
P < 0.001), increased in-hospital mortality (14.9% versus 10.3%, P < 0.001), ICU 
mortality (9.0% versus 7.5%, P = 0.008), and longer length of stay and ICU stay 
were observed in patients taking dexamethasone compared with those not taking 
dexamethasone. Multivariate logistic and Cox regression analyses confirmed that 
dexamethasone was significantly associated with delirium (adjusted odds 
ratio = 1.48, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 1.09-2.00, P = 0.012), in-hospital 
mortality (adjusted hazard ratio = 1.19, 95% CI = 1.02-1.40, P = 0.032), and ICU 
mortality (adjusted hazard ratio = 1.62, 95% CI = 1.22-2.15, P = 0.001). 
Compared with critically ill patients using high-dose dexamethasone, the risk of 
delirium was lower in the dose less than the 10 mg group, and patients using 
10-14 mg may be associated with a lower risk of in-hospital death and the least 
ICU mortality, length of hospital stay, and ICU stay.
CONCLUSIONS: This study demonstrated that the use of dexamethasone in critically 
ill patients exacerbated the occurrence of delirium while increasing the risk of 
in-hospital death, ICU death, and length of hospital stay, with a lower risk of 
delirium and a shorter total length of hospital stay with low-dose dexamethasone 
than with larger doses.

BACKGROUND: Acute ischemic stroke (AIS) is a primary cause of death and 
disability worldwide. Four markers that can be readily determined from 
peripheral blood, namely, the systemic immune-inflammation index (SII), 
neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio (NLR), platelet-to-lymphocyte ratio (PLR), and 
total bilirubin, were measured in this study. We examined the relationship 
between the SII and in-hospital mortality after AIS and evaluated which of the 
above four indicators was most accurate for predicting in-hospital mortality 
after AIS.
METHODS: We selected patients from the Medical Information Mart for Intensive 
Care-IV (MIMIC-IV) database who were aged >18 years and who were diagnosed with 
AIS on admission. We collected the patients' baseline characteristics, including 
various clinical and laboratory data. To investigate the relationship between 
the SII and in-hospital mortality in patients with AIS, we employed the 
generalized additive model (GAM). Differences in in-hospital mortality between 
the groups were summarized by the Kaplan-Meier survival analysis and the 
log-rank test. The receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis was 
used to assess the accuracy of the four indicators (SII, NLR, PLR, and total 
bilirubin) for predicting in-hospital mortality in patients with AIS.
RESULTS: The study included 463 patients, and the in-hospital mortality rate was 
12.31%. The GAM analysis showed a positive correlation between the SII and 
in-hospital mortality in patients with AIS, but the correlation was not linear. 
Unadjusted Cox regression identified a link between a high SII and an increased 
probability of in-hospital mortality. We also found that patients with an SII of 
>1,232 (Q2 group) had a considerably higher chance of in-hospital mortality than 
those with a low SII (Q1 group). The Kaplan-Meier analysis demonstrated that 
patients with an elevated SII had a significantly lower chance of surviving 
their hospital stay than those with a low SII. According to the results of the 
ROC curve analysis, the in-hospital mortality of patients with AIS predicted by 
the SII had an area under the ROC curve of 0.65, which revealed that the SII had 
a better discriminative ability than the NLR, PLR, and total bilirubin.
CONCLUSION: The in-hospital mortality of patients with AIS and the SII were 
positively correlated, but not linearly. A high SII was associated with a worse 
prognosis in patients with AIS. The SII had a modest level of discrimination for 
forecasting in-hospital mortality. The SII was slightly better than the NLR and 
significantly better than the PLR and total bilirubin for predicting in-hospital 
mortality in patients with AIS.

The relationship between albumin corrected anion gap (ACAG) and mortality in 
acute kidney injury (AKI) patients who received continuous renal replacement 
therapy (CRRT) has not been investigated in any previous studies. This study 
aimed to investigate the relationship between ACAG at CRRT initiation and 
all-cause mortality among these patients in the intensive care unit (ICU). 
Patients diagnosed with AKI and treated with CRRT in the ICU from the Medical 
Information Mart for Intensive Care-IV version 1.0 (MIMIC IV) database and 
Huzhou Central Hospital were retrospectively enrolled. Participants were divided 
into two groups: the normal ACAG group (12-20 mmol/L) and high ACAG group 
(> 20 mmol/L). The Kaplan-Meier method and log-rank test were used to compare 
the survival rate between the two groups. Restricted cubic spine (RCS) and Cox 
proportional-hazards models were utilized to analyze the relationship between 
ACAG at CRRT initiation and ICU all-cause mortality of these patients. A total 
of 708 patients met the inclusion criteria in the study. The all-cause mortality 
of these patients during ICU hospitalization was 41.95%. Patients in the high 
ACAG group exhibited significantly higher ICU all-cause mortality rate than 
patients in the normal ACAG group (all P < 0.001). The Kaplan-Meier survival 
curves showed that the normal ACAG group had a higher ICU cumulative survival 
rate than the high ACAG group (log-rank test, χ12 = 13.620, χ22 = 12.460, both 
P < 0.001). In the multivariate COX regression analyses, patients with higher 
ACAG (> 20 mmol/L) levels at the time of CRRT initiation in the MIMIC IV 
database and Huzhou Central Hospital were significantly correlated with ICU 
all-cause mortality after adjusting multiple potential confounding factors with 
hazard ratios of 2.852 (95% CI 1.718-4.734) and 2.637(95% CI 1.584-4.389), 
respectively. In critically AKI patients who undergo CRRT, higher ACAG 
(> 20 mmol/L) level at the initiation of CRRT was significantly correlated with 
ICU all-cause mortality. Therefore, clinicians should pay more attention to 
those patients with a higher ACAG value.

BACKGROUND: Hepatitis B-associated cirrhosis (HBC) is associated with severe 
complications and adverse clinical outcomes. This study aimed to develop and 
validate a predictive model for the occurrence of multiple complications (three 
or more) in patients with HBC and to explore the effects of multiple 
complications on HBC prognosis.
METHODS: In this retrospective cohort study, data from 121 HBC patients treated 
at Nanjing Second Hospital from February 2009 to November 2019 were analysed. 
The maximum follow-up period was 10.75 years, with a median of 5.75 years. Eight 
machine learning techniques were employed to construct predictive models, 
including C5.0, linear discriminant analysis (LDA), least absolute shrinkage and 
selection operator (LASSO), k-nearest neighbour (KNN), gradient boosting 
decision tree (GBDT), support vector machine (SVM), generalised linear model 
(GLM) and naive Bayes (NB), utilising variables such as medical history, 
demographics, clinical signs, and laboratory test results. Model performance was 
evaluated via receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis, residual 
analysis, calibration curve analysis, and decision curve analysis (DCA). The 
influence of multiple complications on HBC survival time was assessed via 
Kaplan‒Meier curve analysis. Furthermore, LASSO and univariable and 
multivariable Cox regression analyses were conducted to identify independent 
prognostic factors for overall survival (OS) in patients with HBC, followed by 
ROC, C-index, calibration curve, and DCA curve analyses of the constructed 
prognostic nomogram model. This study utilized bootstrap resampling for internal 
validation and employed the Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care IV 
(MIMIC-IV) database for external validation.
RESULTS: The GBDT model exhibited the highest area under the curve (AUC) and 
emerged as the optimal model for predicting the occurrence of multiple 
complications. The key predictive factors included posthospitalisation fever 
(PHF), body mass index (BMI), retinol binding protein (RBP), total bilirubin 
(TB) levels, and eosinophils (EOS). Kaplan-Meier analysis revealed that patients 
with multiple complications had significantly worse OS than those with fewer 
complications. Additionally, multivariable Cox regression analysis, informed by 
least absolute shrinkage and LASSO selection, identified hepatocellular 
carcinoma (HCC), multiple complications, and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) levels 
as independent prognostic factors for OS. The prognostic model demonstrated 
1-year, 3-year, and 5-year OS ROC AUCs of 0.802, 0.793, and 0.817, respectively. 
For the internal validation cohort, the corresponding AUC values were 0.797, 
0.832, and 0.835. In contrast, the external validation cohort yielded a 1-year 
ROC AUC of 0.707. Calibration curves indicated good consistency of the model, 
and DCA demonstrated the model's clinical utility, showing high net benefits 
within certain threshold ranges. Compared with the univariable models, the 
multivariable ROC curves indicated higher AUC values for this prognostic model, 
and the model also possessed the best c-index.
CONCLUSION: The GBDT prediction model provides a reliable tool for the early 
identification of high-risk HBC patients prone to developing multiple 
complications. The concurrent occurrence of multiple complications is an 
independent prognostic factor for OS in patients with HBC. The constructed 
prognostic model demonstrated remarkable predictive performance and clinical 
applicability, indicating its crucial role in enhancing patient outcomes through 
timely and targeted interventions.

BACKGROUND: The triglyceride-glucose (TyG) index, an emerging surrogate marker 
of insulin resistance, has been implicated in adverse cardiovascular outcomes. 
However, its prognostic value in critically ill patients with atrial 
fibrillation (AF) remains unclear. This study aimed to investigate the 
association between the TyG index and all-cause mortality in this high-risk 
population.
METHODS: We identified critically ill patients with AF from the Medical 
Information Mart for Intensive Care IV (MIMIC-IV) database and categorized them 
into tertiles based on their TyG index levels. The primary outcome was 30-day 
mortality, with 90-day and 365-day all-cause mortality as secondary outcomes. 
Cox proportional hazards regression analysis and restricted cubic splines were 
used to elucidate the relationship between the TyG index and all-cause 
mortality. Kaplan-Meier survival analysis was performed to visualize survival 
differences among the tertiles.
RESULTS: A total of 1473 patients were included; the 30-day, 90-day, and 365-day 
all-cause mortality rates were 26.8%, 33.3%, and 41.1%, respectively. 
Multivariate Cox proportional hazards analysis revealed that the TyG index was 
independently associated with mortality at 30 days [hazard ratio (HR) (95% 
confidence interval (CI)) 1.26 (1.09-1.45), P = 0.002], 90 days [HR (95% CI) 
1.27 (1.11-1.45), P < 0.001], and 365 days [HR (95% CI) 1.24 (1.10-1.40), 
P < 0.001]. Restricted cubic splines regression showed a positive linear 
association between the TyG index and mortality risk. Kaplan-Meier survival 
curves further confirmed the significant survival disparities across TyG index 
tertiles.
CONCLUSIONS: A significant linear association was observed between higher TyG 
index and increased all-cause mortality at 30, 90, and 365 days in critically 
ill patients with AF. This underscores the role of the TyG index as a key 
prognostic indicator for risk stratification and management in intensive care.

AIMS: This study aims to develop explainable machine learning models and 
clinical tools for predicting mortality in patients in the intensive care unit 
(ICU) with heart failure (HF).
METHODS: Patients diagnosed with HF who experienced their first ICU stay lasting 
between 24 h and 28 days were selected from the Medical Information Mart for 
Intensive Care IV (MIMIC-IV) database. The primary outcome was all-cause 
mortality within 28 days. Data analysis was performed using Python and R, with 
feature selection conducted via least absolute shrinkage and selection operator 
(LASSO) regression. Fifteen models were evaluated, and the most effective model 
was rendered explainable through the Shapley additive explanations (SHAP) 
approach. A nomogram was developed based on logistic regression to facilitate 
interpretation. For external validation, the eICU database was utilized.
RESULTS: After selection, the study included 2343 records, with 1808 surviving 
and 535 deceased patients. The median age of the study population was 70.00, 
with ~3/5 males (60.31%). The median length of stay in the ICU was 6.00 days. 
The median age of the survival group was younger than the non-survival group 
(69.00 vs. 73.00), and non-survival patients spent longer time in the ICU. 
Seventy-five features were initially selected, including basic information, 
vital signs, laboratory tests, haemodynamics and oxygen status. LASSO regression 
determined the shrinkage parameter α = 0.020, and 44 features were chosen for 
model construction. The linear discriminant analysis (LDA) model showed the best 
performance, and the accuracy reached 0.8354 in the training cohort and 0.8563 
in the testing cohort. It showed satisfying area under the curve (AUC), recall, 
precision, F1 score, Cohen's kappa score and Matthew's correlation coefficient. 
The concordance index (c-index) reached 0.7972 in the training cohort and 0.8125 
in the testing cohort. In external validation, the LDA model achieved 
approximately 0.9 in accuracy, precision, recall and F1 score, with an AUC of 
0.79. Univariable analysis was performed in the training cohort. Features that 
differed significantly between the survival and non-survival groups were 
subjected to multiple logistic regression. The nomogram built on multiple 
logistic regression included 14 features and demonstrated excellent performance. 
The AUC of the nomogram is 0.852 in the training cohort, 0.855 in the internal 
validation cohort and 0.770 in the external validation cohort. The calibration 
curve showed good consistency.
CONCLUSIONS: The study developed an LDA and a nomogram model for predicting 
mortality in HF patients in the ICU. The SHAP approach was employed to elucidate

BACKGROUND: The role of stress hyperglycemia ratio (SHR) on the prognosis of 
spontaneous intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH) in patients with different diabetic 
status has not been elucidated. This study aimed to evaluate the prognostic 
value of SHR and admission blood glucose (ABG) for the short- and long-term 
mortality in diabetic and nondiabetic populations with ICH.
METHOD: Participants with ICH were retrospectively retrieved from the Medical 
Information Mart for Intensive Care (MIMIC-IV). The primary outcome was 
all-cause 30-day and 1-year mortality. The association of SHR and ABG with the 
primary outcomes in diabetic and nondiabetic cohorts were assessed by Cox 
proportional hazard regression.
RESULTS: Overall, 1029 patients with a median age of 71.09 (IQR: 60.05-81.97) 
were included. Among them, 548 (53%) individuals were male, and 95 (19%) as well 
as 323 (31%) ones experienced the 30-day and 1-year mortality, respectively. 
After adjusting for confounding variables, individuals in quintile 5 of SHR had 
significantly higher risk of the 30-day and 1-year mortality than those in 
quintile 1 in the whole cohort (30-day mortality: HR 3.33, 95%CI 2.01-5.51; 
1-year mortality: HR 2.09, 95% CI 1.46-3.00) and in nondiabetic patients (30-day 
mortality: HR 4.55, 95%CI 2.33-8.88; 1-year mortality: HR 3.06, 95%CI 
1.93-4.86), but no significant difference was observed in diabetic patients. 
Similar results were observed for ABG as a categorical variable. As continuous 
variable, SHR was independently correlated with the 30-day and 1-year mortality 
in both of the diabetic and nondiabetic cohorts (30-day mortality: HR 2.63, 
95%CI 1.50-4.60. 1-year mortality: HR 2.12, 95%CI 1.33-3.39), but this 
correlation was only observed in nondiabetic cohort for ABG (HR 1.00, 95%CI 
0.99-1.01 for both of the 30-day and 1-year mortality). Moreover, compared with 
ABG, SHR can better improve the C-statistics of the original models regarding 
the 30-day and 1-year outcomes, especially in patients with diabetes (p < 0.001 
in all models).
CONCLUSION: SHR might be a more useful and reliable marker than ABG for 
prognostic prediction and risk stratification in critically ill patients with 
ICH, especially in those with diabetes.

BACKGROUND: Mortality and other clinical outcomes of culture-negative and 
culture-positive among patients with fungal sepsis have not been documented, and 
whether antifungal therapy prior to fungal culture reports is related to 
decreased mortality among patients remains largely controversial. This study 
aimed to determine the mortality and other clinical outcomes of patients with 
positive yeast cultures and further investigate the effects of initial empiric 
antifungal therapy.
METHODS: A retrospective study was conducted among septic patients using the 
Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care (MIMIC)-IV database. Patients with 
sepsis were divided into two groups based on first fungal culture status during 
intensive care unit (ICU) stay, and initial empirical antifungal therapy was 
prescribed based on physician's experience prior to fungal culture reports 
within 48 h. The primary outcome was in-hospital all-cause mortality. The 
secondary outcomes were 30-day all-cause mortality, 60-day all-cause mortality, 
length of ICU stay and length of hospital stay. Multivariate logistic 
regression, propensity score matching (PSM), subgroup analyses and survival 
curve analyses were performed.
RESULTS: This study included 18,496 sepsis patients, of whom 3,477 (18.8%) had 
positive yeast cultures. Patients with positive yeast cultures had higher 
in-hospital all-cause mortality, 60-day all-cause mortality, and longer lengths 
of ICU stay and hospital stay than those with negative yeast cultures after PSM 
(all p < 0.01). Multivariate logistic regression analysis revealed that positive 
yeast culture was a risk factor for in-hospital mortality in the extended model. 
Subgroup analyses showed that the results were robust among the respiratory 
infection, urinary tract infection, gram-positive bacterial infection and 
bacteria-free culture subgroups. Interestingly, empiric antifungal therapy was 
not associated with lower in-hospital mortality among patients with positive 
yeast cultures, mainly manifested in stratification analysis, which showed that 
antifungal treatment did not improve outcomes in the bloodstream infection (odds 
ratio, OR 2.12, 95% CI: 1.16-3.91, p = 0.015) or urinary tract infection groups 
(OR 3.24, 95% CI: 1.48-7.11, p = 0.003).
CONCLUSION: Culture positivity for yeast among sepsis patients was associated 
with worse clinical outcomes, and empiric antifungal therapy did not lower 
in-hospital all-cause mortality in the bloodstream infection or urinary tract 
infection groups in the ICU.

BACKGROUND: Sepsis is a prevalent and severe medical condition which is 
frequently observed in the intensive care unit (ICU). Although numerous 
biomarkers have been identified to predict the prognosis of sepsis, the lactate 
dehydrogenase to albumin ratio (LDH/ALB ratio) has not been extensively 
investigated. The principal objective of this study is to assess the 
relationship between LDH/ALB ratio and all-cause mortality in patients with 
sepsis.
METHODS: This study included all adult critically ill patients with sepsis from 
the Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care IV (MIMIC-IV, version 2.0) 
database. Propensity score matching (PSM) analysis was conducted to mitigate 
bias, and Kaplan-Meier curves were performed to evaluate the cumulative survival 
across different groups. The association between the LDH/ALB ratio and mortality 
was examined through restricted cubic spline (RCS) analysis and Cox regression 
analysis. The robustness of the findings was confirmed through subgroup 
analyses. Additionally, the prognostic capability of the LDH/ALB ratio was 
further evaluated using receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis.
RESULTS: There were 6059 adult patients with sepsis enrolled in the final 
analysis. RCS revealed a non-linear relationship between the LDH/ALB ratio and 
an increased risk of ICU all-cause mortality (χ2 = 46.900, P < 0.001). Following 
PSM analysis, 1553 matched pairs were obtained. As comparison to the low LDH/ALB 
ratio group, the mortality rate in the high LDH/ALB ratio group was 
significantly higher (P < 0.001). Kaplan-Meier curves, both before and after 
PSM, revealed that the ICU cumulative survival rate for patients with sepsis was 
significantly lower in the high LDH/ALB ratio group compared to the low LDH/ALB 
ratio group (χ2 = 93.360, P < 0.001; χ2 = 14.400, P < 0.001). Even after 
adjusting for a range of potential confounders, multivariate Cox regression 
analysis indicated that an elevated LDH/ALB ratio was a significant predictor of 
all-cause mortality in these patients. ROC curve analysis demonstrated that the 
LDH/ALB ratio had an area under the ROC curve (AUC) of 0.688 for predicting ICU 
mortality, with a sensitivity of 69.2% and a specificity of 58.6%.
CONCLUSIONS: An elevated LDH/ALB ratio (≥10.57) was associated with all-cause 
mortality in critically ill patients with sepsis, and it might serve as a 
prognostic marker. Clinicians should pay closer attention to sepsis patients 
presenting with an LDH/ALB ratio of 10.57 or higher.

BACKGROUND: Previous studies have indicated that the ratio of lactate/albumin 
(L/A) has predictive value for the prognosis of critically ill patients with 
heart failure. Some studies have also indicated that a low serum bicarbonate 
concentration is inversely related to the mortality risk of patients with 
cardiogenic shock. However, the value of bicarbonate and the L/A ratio for 
predicting the mortality risk of patients with acute myocardial infarction (AMI) 
is still unclear. We therefore conducted a retrospective study to research this 
problem.
METHODS: The subjects of this study were patients with AMI, and the data source 
was the Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care III database. The primary 
endpoint was 30-day all-cause mortality after admission. The Receiver operating 
characteristic (ROC) curve was used to compare the predictive value of L/A 
ratio, lactate and albumin for end-point events. The effects of different L/A 
ratio levels and different bicarbonate concentrations on 7-day and 30-day 
all-cause mortality were compared using Kaplan-Meier (K-M) curves. Hazard ratios 
for different L/A ratio and different bicarbonate concentrations were 
investigated using COX proportional hazards models.
RESULTS: The Area Under Curve (AUC) of L/A ratio, lactate, and albumin were 
0.736, 0.718, and 0.620, respectively. (1) L/A ratio: The patients were divided 
into three groups according to their L/A ratio: tertile T1 (L/A ratio ≤ 0.47), 
tertile T2 (L/A ratio ≤ 0.97), and tertile T3 (L/A ratio > 0.97). The T2 and T3 
groups had higher 30-day all-cause mortality risks than the T1 group. The 
restricted cubic spline (RCS) model indicated that there was a nonlinear 
relationship between L/A ratio and 30-day mortality (P < 0.05). (2) Bicarbonate 
concentration: The patients were also divided into three groups based on their 
bicarbonate concentration: G1 (22-27 mmol/L), G2 (< 22 mmol/L), and G3 
(> 27 mmol/L). The G2 and G3 groups had higher 30-day all-cause mortality risks 
than the G1 group. The RCS model indicated that there was a nonlinear 
relationship between bicarbonate concentration and 30-day mortality (P < 0.05). 
The RCS model indicated that there was a nonlinear relationship between 
hemoglobin level and 30-day all-cause mortality (P < 0.05).
CONCLUSION: L/A ratio and bicarbonate concentration and hemoglobin level have 
predictive value for predicting 30-day mortality in patients with acute 
myocardial infarction.

BACKGROUND: Septic shock patients fundamentally require delicate vasoactive and 
inotropic agent administration, which could be quantitatively and objectively 
evaluated by the vasoactive-inotropic score (VIS); however, whether the dynamic 
trends of high-time-resolution VIS alter the clinical outcomes remains unclear. 
Thus, this study proposes the term VIS Reduction Rate (VRR) to generalise the 
tendency of dynamic VIS, to explore the association of VRR and mortality for 
patients with septic shock.
METHODS: We applied dynamic and static VIS data to predict ICU mortality by two 
models: the long short-term memory (LSTM) deep learning model, and the extreme 
gradient boosting (XGBoost), respectively. The specific target cohort was 
extracted from the Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care IV (MIMIC-IV) 
database by the sophisticated structured query language (SQL). Enrolled patients 
were divided into four groups by VRR value: ≥50%, 0 ~ 50%, -50% ~ 0, and < -50%. 
Statistical approaches included pairwise propensity score matching (PSM), Cox 
proportional hazards regression, and two doubly robust estimation models to 
ensure the robustness of the results. The primary and secondary outcomes were 
ICU mortality and in-hospital mortality, respectively.
RESULTS: VRR simplifies the dosing trends of vasoactive and inotropic agents 
represented by dynamic VIS data while requiring fewer data. In total, 8,887 
septic shock patients were included. Compared with the VRR ≥50% group, the 
0 ~ 50%, -50% ~ 0, and < -50% groups had significantly higher ICU mortality 
[hazard ratio (HR) 1.32, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.17-1.50, p < 0.001; HR 
1.79, 95% CI 1.44-2.22, p < 0.001; HR 2.07, 95% CI 1.61-2.66, p < 0.001, 
respectively] and in-hospital mortality [HR 1.43, 95% CI 1.28-1.60, p < 0.001; 
HR 1.75, 95% CI 1.45-2.11, p < 0.001; HR 2.00, 95% CI 1.61-2.49, p < 0.001, 
respectively]. Similar findings were observed in two doubly robust estimation 
models.
CONCLUSION: The trends of dynamic VIS in ICU might help intensivists to stratify 
the prognosis of adult patients with septic shock. A lower decline of VIS was 
remarkably associated with higher ICU and in-hospital mortality among septic 
shock patients receiving vasoactive-inotropic therapy for more than 24 h.

BACKGROUND: The red blood cell distribution width (RDW)-to-albumin ratio (RAR) 
has emerged as a potentially valuable prognostic indicator in diverse medical 
conditions. However, the prognostic significance of RAR in intensive care unit 
(ICU) patients with coronary heart disease (CHD) and diabetes mellitus (DM) 
remains uncertain and requires further investigation.
METHODS: This study aims to investigate the prognostic significance of RAR in 
ICU patients with coexisting CHD and DM through a retrospective cohort analysis 
using data from the Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care IV (MIMIC-IV) 
database (version 2.2). The study population included patients aged 18 years or 
older who were diagnosed with both CHD and DM. The primary endpoint was 1-year 
mortality, and the secondary endpoints included 30-day mortality, 90-day 
mortality, hospital length of stay (LOS), and ICU LOS.
RESULTS: A total of 3416 patients, of whom 64.64% were male, were included in 
the study. The 30-day mortality, 90-day mortality, and 1-year mortality were 
7.08%, 7.44%, and 7.49%, respectively. After adjusting for confounding factors, 
multivariate Cox proportional risk analysis demonstrated that high RAR levels 
were associated with an increased risk of 30-day mortality (HR, 1.53 [95% CI 
1.17-2.07], P = 0.006), 90-day mortality (HR, 1.58 [95% CI 1.17-2.13], P = 
0.003), and 1-year mortality (HR, 1.58 [95% CI 1.17-2.13], P = 0.003). 
Furthermore, the restricted cubic spline (RCS) model indicated a linear 
relationship between RAR and 1-year mortality.
CONCLUSION: The results suggest that RAR holds potential as a valuable 
prognostic biomarker in ICU patients with both CHD and DM. Elevated RAR levels 
were found to be significantly associated with increased mortality during 
hospitalization, facilitating the identification of individuals at higher risk 
of adverse outcomes. These findings underscore the importance of incorporating 
RAR into risk stratification and overall management strategies for ICU patients 
with coexisting CHD and DM.

OBJECTIVES: Prolonged intubation (PI) is a frequently encountered severe 
complication among patients following cardiac surgery (CS). Solely concentrating 
on preoperative data, devoid of sufficient consideration for the ongoing impact 
of surgical, anesthetic, and cardiopulmonary bypass procedures on subsequent 
respiratory system function, could potentially compromise the predictive 
accuracy of disease prognosis. In response to this challenge, we formulated and 
externally validated an intelligible prediction model tailored for CS patients, 
leveraging both preoperative information and early intensive care unit (ICU) 
data to facilitate early prophylaxis for PI.
METHODS: We conducted a retrospective cohort study, analyzing adult patients who 
underwent CS and utilizing data from two publicly available ICU databases, 
namely, the Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care and the eICU 
Collaborative Research Database. PI was defined as necessitating intubation for 
over 24 h. The predictive model was constructed using multivariable logistic 
regression. External validation of the model's predictive performance was 
conducted, and the findings were elucidated through visualization techniques.
RESULTS: The incidence rates of PI in the training, testing, and external 
validation cohorts were 11.8%, 12.1%, and 17.5%, respectively. We identified 11 
predictive factors associated with PI following CS: plateau pressure [odds ratio 
(OR), 1.133; 95% confidence interval (CI), 1.111-1.157], lactate level (OR, 
1.131; 95% CI, 1.067-1.2), Charlson Comorbidity Index (OR, 1.166; 95% CI, 
1.115-1.219), Sequential Organ Failure Assessment score (OR, 1.096; 95% CI, 
1.061-1.132), central venous pressure (OR, 1.052; 95% CI, 1.033-1.073), anion 
gap (OR, 1.075; 95% CI, 1.043-1.107), positive end-expiratory pressure (OR, 
1.087; 95% CI, 1.047-1.129), vasopressor usage (OR, 1.521; 95% CI, 1.23-1.879), 
Visual Analog Scale score (OR, 0.928; 95% CI, 0.893-0.964), pH value (OR, 0.757; 
95% CI, 0.629-0.913), and blood urea nitrogen level (OR, 1.011; 95% CI, 
1.003-1.02). The model exhibited an area under the receiver operating 
characteristic curve (AUROC) of 0.853 (95% CI, 0.840-0.865) in the training 
cohort, 0.867 (95% CI, 0.853-0.882) in the testing cohort, and 0.704 (95% CI, 
0.679-0.727) in the external validation cohort.
CONCLUSIONS: Through multicenter internal and external validation, our model, 
which integrates early ICU data and preoperative information, exhibited 
outstanding discriminative capability. This integration allows for the accurate 
assessment of PI risk in the initial phases following CS, facilitating timely 
interventions to mitigate adverse outcomes.

PURPOSE: To develop and validate a machine learning (ML)-based prediction model 
for acute kidney injury (AKI) in patients with liver cirrhosis.
METHODS: Data on liver cirrhosis patients were extracted from the Medical 
Information Mart for Intensive Care III (MIMIC-III) and MIMIC-IV databases in 
this retrospective cohort study. ML algorithms, including random forest (RF), 
extreme gradient boosting (XGB), light gradient boosting machine (LGBM), and 
gradient boosting decision tree (GBDT) were applied to construct prediction 
models. Predictors were screened via univariate logistic regression, and then 
the models were developed with all data of the included patients. A bootstrap 
resampling method was adopted to validate the models. The predictive abilities 
of our final model were compared with those of the sequential organ failure 
assessment score (SOFA), simplified acute physiology score II (SAPS II), Model 
for End-stage Liver Disease (MELD), and MELD Na.
RESULTS: This study included 950 patients, of which 429 (45.16%) had AKI. 
Mechanical ventilation, vasopressor, international normalized ratio (INR), 
bilirubin, Charlson comorbidity index (CCI), prothrombin time (PT), estimated 
glomerular filtration rate (EGFR), partial thromboplastin time (PTT), and heart 
rate served as predictors. In the derivation set, the developed RF [area under 
curve (AUC) = 0.747], XGB (AUC = 0.832), LGBM (AUC = 0.785), and GBDT 
(AUC = 0.811) models exhibited significantly greater predictive performance than 
the logistic regression model (AUC = 0.699) (all P < 0.05). Among the ML-based 
models, the XGB model had the greatest AUC. In internal validation, the 
predictive capacity of the XGB model (AUC = 0.833) was significantly superior to 
that of the logistic regression model (AUC = 0.701) (P = 0.045). Hence, the XGB 
model was selected as the final model for AKI prediction. In contrast to the XGB 
model (AUC = 0.832), the SOFA (AUC = 0.609), MELD (AUC = 0.690), MELD Na 
(AUC = 0.690), and SAPS II (AUC = 0.641) had significantly lower predictive 
abilities in the derivation set (all P < 0.001). The XGB model was internally 
validated to have an AUC of 0.833, which was significantly higher than the SOFA 
(AUC = 0.609), MELD (AUC = 0.690), MELD Na (AUC = 0.688), and SAPS II 
(AUC = 0.641) (all P < 0.05).
CONCLUSION: The XGB model had a better performance than the logistic regression 
model, SOFA, MELD, MELD Na, and SAPS II in AKI prediction for cirrhosis 
patients, which may help identify patients at a risk of AKI, and then provide 
timely interventions.

BACKGROUND: There are many Machine Learning (ML) models which predict acute 
kidney injury (AKI) for hospitalised patients. While a primary goal of these 
models is to support clinical decision-making, the adoption of inconsistent 
methods of estimating baseline serum creatinine (sCr) may result in a poor 
understanding of these models' effectiveness in clinical practice. Until now, 
the performance of such models with different baselines has not been compared on 
a single dataset. Additionally, AKI prediction models are known to have a high 
rate of false positive (FP) events regardless of baseline methods. This warrants 
further exploration of FP events to provide insight into potential underlying 
reasons.
OBJECTIVE: The first aim of this study was to assess the variance in performance 
of ML models using three methods of baseline sCr on a retrospective dataset. The 
second aim was to conduct an error analysis to gain insight into the underlying 
factors contributing to FP events.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: The Intensive Care Unit (ICU) patients of the Medical 
Information Mart for Intensive Care (MIMIC)-IV dataset was used with the KDIGO 
(Kidney Disease Improving Global Outcome) definition to identify AKI episodes. 
Three different methods of estimating baseline sCr were defined as (1) the 
minimum sCr, (2) the Modification of Diet in Renal Disease (MDRD) equation and 
the minimum sCr and (3) the MDRD equation and the mean of preadmission sCr. For 
the first aim of this study, a suite of ML models was developed for each 
baseline and the performance of the models was assessed. An analysis of variance 
was performed to assess the significant difference between eXtreme Gradient 
Boosting (XGB) models across all baselines. To address the second aim, 
Explainable AI (XAI) methods were used to analyse the XGB errors with Baseline 
3.
RESULTS: Regarding the first aim, we observed variances in discriminative 
metrics and calibration errors of ML models when different baseline methods were 
adopted. Using Baseline 1 resulted in a 14% reduction in the f1 score for both 
Baseline 2 and Baseline 3. There was no significant difference observed in the 
results between Baseline 2 and Baseline 3. For the second aim, the FP cohort was 
analysed using the XAI methods which led to relabelling data with the mean of 
sCr in 180 to 0 days pre-ICU as the preferred sCr baseline method. The XGB model 
using this relabelled data achieved an AUC of 0.85, recall of 0.63, precision of 
0.54 and f1 score of 0.58. The cohort size was 31,586 admissions, of which 5,473 
(17.32%) had AKI.
CONCLUSION: In the absence of a widely accepted method of baseline sCr, AKI 
prediction studies need to consider the impact of different baseline methods on 
the effectiveness of ML models and their potential implications in real-world 
implementations. The utilisation of XAI methods can be effective in providing 
insight into the occurrence of prediction errors. This can potentially augment 
the success rate of ML implementation in routine care.

BACKGROUND: Cardiogenic shock (CS) is a severe cardiac disorder with a high 
mortality rate. The triglyceride-glucose (TyG) index, a biomarker of insulin 
resistance, is associated with cardiovascular disease-related mortality. This 
study aimed to investigate the association between the TyG index and mortality 
in patients with CS.
METHODS: This retrospective cohort study analyzed 727 patients with CS from the 
Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care IV database. The TyG index was 
calculated as follows: ln[triglycerides (mg/dL) × fasting blood glucose 
(mg/dL)/2]. Outcomes included 28-day intensive care unit (ICU) mortality and 
28-day in-hospital mortality. Kaplan-Meier survival curve models and Cox 
proportional hazards regression models were used to evaluate the prognostic 
significance of the TyG index. Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) curve 
analysis was used to determine the predictive efficacy of the TyG index for 
mortality. Subgroup analyses were conducted to determine the association between 
the TyG index and mortality across different groups.
RESULTS: Non-survivors had a significantly higher TyG index (ICU: 9.30 vs. 9.13, 
p = 0.008; in-hospital: 9.29 vs. 9.13, p = 0.004). Adjusted Cox models showed 
that each 1-unit increase in the TyG index increased ICU mortality risk by 24% 
(hazard ratio [HR] = 1.24, 95% confidence interval [CI]:1.04-1.48; p = 0.015) 
and in-hospital mortality by 44% (HR = 1.44, 95% CI:1.11-1.88; p = 0.007). The 
Quartile 4 TyG index ICU mortality was increased by 77% (HR = 1.77, 95% 
CI:1.09-2.89) compared to that for Quartile 1 and in-hospital mortality was 
increased by 61% (HR = 1.61, 95% CI:1.08-2.38). The area under the ROC curve 
(AUROC) showed a modest standalone predictive ability of 0.56, but when combined 
with clinical variables, the AUROC improved to 0.80 (ICU) and 0.78 
(in-hospital). Subgroup analyses identified stronger associations in 
patients ≥ 60 years, females, non-septic, and those with acute myocardial 
infarction or heart failure.
CONCLUSIONS: The TyG index is significantly associated with short-term mortality 
in patients with CS and may serve as a useful biomarker for risk stratification.

OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to develop and validate a nomogram for predicting 
28-day and 90-day mortality in intensive care unit (ICU) patients who have 
chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) coexisting with congestive heart 
failure (CHF).
METHODS: An extensive analysis was conducted on clinical data from the Medical 
Information Mart for Intensive Care IV database, covering patients over 18 years 
old with both COPD and CHF, who were were first-time ICU admissions between 2008 
and 2019. The least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) regression 
method was employed to screen clinical features, with the final model being 
optimized using backward stepwise regression guided by the Akaike Information 
Criterion (AIC) to construct the nomogram. The predictive model's discrimination 
and clinical applicability were evaluated via receiver operating characteristic 
(ROC) curves, calibration curves, the C-index, and decision curve analysi s 
(DCA).
RESULTS: This analysis was comprised of a total of 1948 patients. Patients were 
separated into developing and validation cohorts in a 7:3 ratio, with similar 
baseline characteristics between the two groups. The ICU mortality rates for the 
developing and verification cohorts were 20.8 % and 19.5 % at 28 days, 
respectively, and 29.4 % and 28.3 % at 90 days, respectively. The clinical 
characteristics retained by the backward stepwise regression include age, 
weight, systolic blood pressure (SBP), respiratory rate (RR), oxygen saturation 
(SpO2), red blood cell distribution width (RDW), lactate, partial thrombosis 
time (PTT), race, marital status, type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM), malignant 
cancer, acute kidney failure (AKF), pneumonia, immunosuppressive drugs, 
antiplatelet agents, vasoactive agents, acute physiology score III (APS III), 
Oxford acute severity of illness score (OASIS), and Charlson comorbidity index 
(CCI). We developed two separate models by assigning weighted scores to each 
independent risk factor: nomogram A excludes CCI but includes age, T2DM, and 
malignant cancer, while nomogram B includes only CCI, without age, T2DM, and 
malignant cancer. Based on the results of the AUC and C-index, this study 
selected nomogram A, which demonstrated better predictive performance, for 
subsequent validation. The calibration curve, C-index, and DCA results indicate 
that nomogram A has good accuracy in predicting short-term mortality and 
demonstrates better discriminative ability than commonly used clinical scoring 
systems, making it more suitable for clinical application.
CONCLUSION: The nomogram developed in this study offers an effective assessment 
of short-term mortality risk for ICU patients with COPD and CHF, proving to be a 
superior tool for predicting their short-term prognosis.

BACKGROUND: Vitamin D, an essential fat-soluble micronutrient, exerts diverse 
physiological effects including the regulation of calcium ion homeostasis, 
modulation of immune response, and enhancement of resistance against infectious 
pathogens. Empirical investigations have elucidated an association between 
inadequate levels of vitamin D and adverse clinical outcomes in critically ill 
cohorts, with a noteworthy prevalence of vitamin D deficiency observed among 
patients afflicted with acute kidney injury (AKI). In the context of this 
retrospective inquiry, our aim was to assess the potential correlation between 
vitamin D supplementation administered during admission to the intensive care 
unit (ICU) and the improvement of outcomes specifically in cases of severe AKI.
METHODS: This study utilized data from the Medical Information Mart for 
Intensive Care IV (MIMIC-IV), a repository of ICU patient records from Beth 
Israel Deaconess Medical Center (BIDMC) in the United States. We focused on 
patients diagnosed with epsis-associated acute kidney injury (SA-AKI), dividing 
them into those who received vitamin D supplementation during their ICU 
admission and those who did not. Our primary analysis evaluated in-hospital 
mortality using various statistical methods, such as Kaplan-Meier survival 
curves, Cox proportional hazards regression models, and subgroup analyses. To 
enhance the robustness of our findings, we used propensity score matching (PSM) 
to reduce potential biases. Secondary outcomes included 28-day, 90-day mortality 
rates and norepinephrine-free days at 28 days.
RESULTS: In this investigation, a cohort of 11,896 individuals diagnosed with 
SA-AKI was studied. Among them, 2,724 patients received vitamin D 
supplementation (the vitamin D group) while 9,172 did not (the no-vitamin D 
group). Kaplan-Meier survival analysis indicated a significant difference in 
survival probabilities between the two cohorts. Upon adjusting for potential 
confounders using Cox regression modeling, a notably decreased risk of 
hospitalization and ICU mortality was observed in the vitamin D group compared 
to the no-vitamin D group, with an adjusted risk ratio for in-hospital mortality 
of 0.56 (95% CI: 0.5-0.63). These findings were consistent following PSM and 
subsequent adjustments for propensity score, pairwise algorithm (PA), and 
overlapping weights (OW) analyses, yielding hazard ratios ranging from 0.53 to 
0.59, all with p-values <0.001. Notably, E-value analyses underscored the 
robustness of these results against potential unmeasured confounders.
CONCLUSION: This study suggests that vitamin D supplementation may be associated 
with a reduced in-hospital mortality rate among SA-AKI patients in the ICU. 
Furthermore, the 28-day, 90-day mortality rates and norepinephrine days were 
significantly reduced in the group receiving vitamin D supplementation.

BACKGROUND: Trauma patients admitted to critical care are at high risk of 
mortality because of their injuries. Our aim was to develop a machine 
learning-based model to predict mortality using Fahad-Liaqat-Ahmad Intensive 
Machine (FLAIM) framework. We hypothesized machine learning could be applied to 
critically ill patients and would outperform currently used mortality scores.
METHODS: The current Deep-FLAIM model evaluates the statistically significant 
risk factors and then supply these risk factors to deep neural network to 
predict mortality in trauma patients admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU). 
We analyzed adult patients (≥18 years) admitted to the trauma ICU in the 
publicly available database Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care III 
version 1.4. The first phase selection of risk factor was done using 
Cox-regression univariate and multivariate analyses. In the second phase, we 
applied deep neural network and other traditional machine learning models like 
Linear Discriminant Analysis, Gaussian Naïve Bayes, Decision Tree Model, and 
k-nearest neighbor models.
RESULTS: We identified a total of 3,041 trauma patients admitted to the trauma 
surgery ICU. We observed that several clinical and laboratory-based variables 
were statistically significant for both univariate and multivariate analyses 
while others were not. With most significant being serum anion gap (hazard ratio 
[HR], 2.46; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.94-3.11), sodium (HR, 2.11; 95% CI, 
1.61-2.77), and chloride (HR, 2.11; 95% CI, 1.69-2.64) abnormalities on 
laboratories, while clinical variables included the diagnosis of sepsis (HR, 
2.03; 95% CI, 1.23-3.37), Quick Sequential Organ Failure Assessment score (HR, 
1.52; 95% CI, 1.32-3.76). And Systemic Inflammatory Response Syndrome criteria 
(HR. 1.41; 95% CI, 1.24-1.26). After we used these clinically significant 
variables and applied various machine learning models to the data, we found out 
that our proposed DNN outperformed all the other methods with test set accuracy 
of 92.25%, sensitivity of 79.13%, and specificity of 94.16%; positive predictive 
value, 66.42%; negative predictive value, 96.87%; and area under the curve of 
the receiver-operator curve of 0.91 (1.45-1.29).
CONCLUSION: Our novel Deep-FLAIM model outperformed all other machine learning 
models. The model is easy to implement, user friendly and with high accuracy.

OBJECTIVE: To investigate the risk factors affecting the prognosis of patients 
with acute kidney injury (AKI) in the intensive care unit (ICU) based on the 
Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care III (MIMIC-III) database, and to 
establish a prognostic model for AKI.
METHODS: Patients (aged ≥ 18 years) with acute renal failure, admitted to the 
ICU for the first time, and had complete hospital records (the RIFLE diagnostic 
criteria were used in the database, and the diagnosis was expressed as AKI in 
this article) were screened from MIMIC-III database according to diagnostic 
codes. Patients were divided into two groups based on survival state at 
discharge, and the general information, underlying diseases, injury factors, 
vital signs and laboratory indicators within 24 hours after AKI, related 
intervention and prognostic indicators were analyzed. Univariate and 
multivariate Logistic regression analysis were used to determine the risk 
factors affecting mortality in patients with AKI and established a prediction 
model. The receiver operator characteristic curve (ROC curve) was used to 
analyze the predictive value of the prediction model for the prognosis of AKI 
patients.
RESULTS: There were 4 554 patients with AKI included and 862 died, with 
mortality of 18.93%. Univariate Logistic regression analysis was performed for 
factors that might be associated with death in AKI patients, and the results 
showed that age, hypertension, lymphoma, metastatic carcinoma, vancomycin, 
aspirin, coagulation abnormalities, cardiac arrest, sepsis or septic shock, 
invasive mechanical ventilation, white blood cell count (WBC), platelet count 
(PLT), K+, blood urea nitrogen (BUN), total bilirubin (TBil), renal replacement 
therapy (RRT) and length of stay (LOS) were independent risk factors [odds ratio

(1.004-1.015), respectively, all P < 0.05]. The Hosmer-Lemeshow test showed that 
the AKI prognostic model was able to fit the observed data well (P = 0.604). ROC 
curve analysis showed that the area under ROC curve (AUC) of the AKI prognostic 
model was 0.716 (95%CI was 0.697-0.735), when the cut-off value was 0.320, the 
sensitivity was 71.9%, the specificity was 60.1%, the positive likelihood ratio 
was 1.80, and the negative likelihood ratio was 0.47.
CONCLUSIONS: The prognostic prediction model of AKI in critically ill patients 
established and based on the MIMIC-III database may have practical significance 
for prognostic risk assessment of AKI and later intervention.

OBJECTIVE: To visualize the relationship between different combinations of 
mechanical power exposure intensity-duration and death risk in mechanical 
ventilation patients using a visualization method.
METHODS: Critically ill patients receiving mechanical ventilation were selected 
from the Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care- IV v1.0 (MIMIC- IV v1.0) 
database. The patients were divided into four subgroups according to oxygenation 
index (PaO2/FiO2) including > 300 mmHg (1 mmHg ≈ 0.133 kPa) group, 201-300 mmHg 
group, 101-200 mmHg group and ≤100 mmHg group. The baseline characteristics, 
ventilator parameters, and prognostic indicators for different patient 
populations were collected. For each patient, the mechanical power thresholds 
from low to high (5-30 J/min, increasing at intervals of 1 J/min) were used to 
evaluate the different exposures of mechanical power (above the set threshold 
was recorded as one exposure), and the number of events with different exposure 
intensity-duration combinations was counted based on their corresponding 
durations. Based on the 28-day survival/non-survival status, the number of 
exposures for survivors and non-survivors in each exposure intensity-duration 
combination was calculated, and the survival odds ratio (OR) for different 
mechanical power exposure intensity-duration combinations was subsequently 
computed. Two-dimensional tables were generated with mechanical power exposure 
duration on the x-axis and exposure intensity on the y-axis, and the heatmap and 
its corresponding equipotential line view were used to visualize the OR value to 
assess the risk of death.
RESULTS: A total of 5 378 patients receiving mechanical ventilation were 
enrolled in the study, of whom 2 069 patients in the PaO2/FiO2 > 300 mmHg group, 
813 patients in the 201-300 mmHg group, 1 493 patients in the 101-200 mmHg 
group, and 1 003 patients in the ≤100 mmHg group. The severity scores of 
patients, including sequential organ failure assessment (SOFA) score and 
simplified acute physiology score II (SAPS II), gradually increased following 
the decrease in PaO2/FiO2, and the incidence of co-morbidities also gradually 
increased. In terms of ventilator parameters, mechanical power was increased 
gradually with decrease in PaO2/FiO2, measuring 10.4 (7.8, 13.9), 11.3 (8.5, 
14.7), 13.6 (10.0, 18.2), and 16.7 (12.5, 22.0) J/min (P < 0.01). In terms of 
prognosis, 28-day mortality of patients was gradually increased with decrease in 
PaO2/FiO2 [29.1% (601/2 069), 26.9% (219/813), 28.1% (420/1 493), and 33.3% 
(334/1 003), respectively, P < 0.05]. In the heatmap, it could be observed that 
the 28-day death risk of mechanical ventilation patients was gradually increased 
with increase in mechanical power exposure intensity and long duration, showing 
two distinct areas: a region near the bottom left corner (representing low 
mechanical power exposure intensity and short duration) was blue, indicating a 
greater chance of survival. In contrast, another region near the top right 
corner (representing high mechanical power exposure intensity and long duration) 
was red, indicating a higher risk of death. According to the fitted lines of 
death risk, for the same risk of death, a shorter mechanical power exposure 
duration was required for higher exposure intensity, while lower mechanical 
power exposure intensity required a longer exposure duration. The above trend of 
change was similarly reflected in the overall population and different 
oxygenation populations.
CONCLUSIONS: Cumulative mechanical power exposure to higher intensity and/or 
longer duration is associated with worse outcomes in mechanical ventilation 
patients. Considering both the mechanical power exposure intensity and duration 
may help to evaluate the effectiveness of lung protection in mechanical 
ventilation patients and guide adjustments in mechanical ventilation strategy to 
reduce the risk of ventilator-induced lung injury.

BACKGROUND: The triglyceride-glucose (TyG) index serves as a reliable proxy for 
insulin resistance (IR). IR has been linked to heightened incidence, prevalence, 
or severity of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and asthma. Prior 
research indicates that critically ill patients are prone to developing IR. 
Nevertheless, few studies have delved into the correlation between IR and 
all-cause mortality in critically ill patients with COPD and asthma. Therefore, 
the aim of this study is to explore the association between the TyG index and 
all-cause mortality in patients with COPD and asthma, with the goal of assessing 
the impact of IR on the prognosis of this patient population.
METHODS: This is a retrospective study, and all data are from the Medical 
Information Mart for Intensive Care IV (MIMIC-IV) critical care database. This 
study included 684 ICU patients with COPD and asthma and divided them into 
quartiles based on TyG index levels. The primary outcomes of this study were 
all-cause mortality during follow-up, encompassing mortality at 30 days, 90 
days, and 180 days. The Kaplan-Meier analysis was used to compare all-cause 
mortality among the above four groups. Cox proportional hazards analyses were 
performed to examine the association between TyG index and all-cause mortality 
in critically ill patients with COPD and asthma. Restricted cubic spline 
analysis was used to assess potential nonlinear association between the TyG 
index and the primary outcome.
RESULTS: A total of 684 patients (53.9% female) were included. The 90-days 
all-cause mortality rate and 180-days all-cause mortality were 11.7% and 12.3%, 
respectively. Kaplan-Meier analysis revealed a significant association between 
the TyG index and both 90-days all-cause mortality (log-rank p = .039) and 
180-days all-cause mortality (log-rank p = .017). Cox proportional hazards 
analysis revealed a significant association between the TyG index and 90-days 
all-cause mortality in both the unadjusted model (HR, 1.30 [95% CI 1.08-1.57] p 
= .005) and the model adjusted for age, gender, and diabetes (HR, 1.38 [95% CI 
1.15-1.67] p < .001). Similarly, the TyG index was associated with 180-days 
all-cause mortality in the unadjusted model (HR, 1.30 [95% CI 1.09-1.56] p = 
.004) and the model adjusted for age, sex, and diabetes (HR, 1.38 [95% CI 
1.15-1.66] p < .001). The restricted cubic splines (RCS) regression model 
indicated a significant nonlinear association between the TyG index and both 
90-days and 180-days all-cause mortality. Specifically, TyG index >4.8 was 
associated with an increased risk of mortality at both 90 days and 180 days.
CONCLUSIONS: In summary, our results extend the utility of the TyG index to 
critically ill patients with COPD and asthma. Our study shows that the TyG index 
is a potential predictor of all-cause mortality in critically ill patients with 
COPD and asthma. In addition, in patients with a TyG index exceeding 4.8, there 
was a heightened risk of mortality. Measuring the TyG index may help with risk 
stratification and prognosis prediction in critically ill patients with COPD and 
asthma. Further prospective studies are needed to confirm our findings.

It has been demonstrated that lactate/albumin (L/A) ratio is substantially 
relevant to the prognosis of sepsis, septic shock, and heart failure. However, 
there is still debate regarding the connection between the L/A ratio and severe 
acute myocardial infarction (AMI). The aim of this study is to determine the 
prognostic role of L/A ratio in patients with severe AMI. Our retrospective 
study extracted data from the Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care III 
(MIMIC-III) database, included 1,134 patients diagnosed with AMI. Based on the 
tertiles of L/A ratio, the patients were divided into three groups: Tertile1 
(T1) group (L/A ratio<0.4063, n=379), Tertile2 (T2) group (0.4063≤L/A 
ratio≤0.6667, n =379), and Tertile3 (T3) group (L/A ratio>0.6667, n =376). Uni- 
and multivariate COX regression model were used to analyze the relationship 
between L/A ratio and 14-day, 28-day and 90-day all-cause mortality. Meanwhile, 
the restricted cubic spline (RCS) model was used to evaluate the effect of L/A 
ratio as a continuous variable. Higher mortality was observed in AMI patients 
with higher L/A ratio. Multivariate Cox proportional risk model validated the 
independent association of L/A ratio with 14-day all-cause mortality [hazard 
ratio (HR) 1.813, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.041-3.156 (T3 vs T1 group)], 
28-day all-cause mortality [HR 1.725, 95% CI 1.035-2.874 (T2 vs T1 group), HR 
1.991, 95% CI 1.214-3.266 (T3 vs T1 group)], as well as 90-day all-cause 
mortality [HR 1.934, 95% CI 1.176-3.183 (T2 vs T1 group), HR 2.307, 95% CI 
1.426-3.733 (T3 vs T1 group)]. There was a consistent trend in subgroup 
analysis. The Kaplan-Meier (K-M) survival curves indicated that patients with 
L/A ratio>0.6667 had the highest mortality. Even after adjusting the confounding 
factors, RCS curves revealed a nearly linearity between L/A ratio and 14-day, 
28-day and 90-day all-cause mortality. Meanwhile, the areas under the receiver 
operating characteristic (ROC) curve (AUC) of 14-day, 28-day and 90-day 
all-cause mortality were 0.730, 0.725 and 0.730, respectively. L/A ratio was 
significantly associated with 14-day, 28-day and 90-day all-cause mortality in 
critical patients with AMI. Higher L/A ratio will be considered an independent 
risk factor for higher mortality in AMI patients.

OBJECTIVE: To explore the optimal pulse oxygen saturation (SpO2) range during 
hospitalization for patients with sepsis.
METHODS: A case-control study design was employed. Demographic information, 
vital signs, comorbidities, laboratory parameters, critical illness scores, 
clinical treatment information, and clinical outcomes of sepsis patients were 
extracted from the Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care- IV (MIMIC- IV). 
A generalized additive model (GAM) combined with a Loess smoothing function was 
employed to analyze and visualize the nonlinear relationship between SpO2 levels 
during hospitalization and in-hospital all-cause mortality. The optimal range of 
SpO2 was determined, and Logistic regression model along with Kaplan-Meier curve 
were utilized to validate the association between the determined range of SpO2 
and in-hospital all-cause mortality.
RESULTS: A total of 5 937 patients met the inclusion criteria, among whom 1 191 
(20.1%) died during hospitalization. GAM analysis revealed a nonlinear and 
U-shaped relationship between SpO2 levels and in-hospital all-cause mortality 
among sepsis patients during hospitalization. Multivariable Logistic regression 
analysis further confirmed that patients with SpO2 levels between 0.96 and 0.98 
during hospitalization had a decreased mortality compared to those with SpO2 < 
0.96 [hypoxia group; odds ratio (OR) = 2.659, 95% confidence interval (95%CI) 
was 2.190-3.229, P < 0.001] and SpO2 > 0.98 (hyperoxia group; OR = 1.594, 95%CI 
was 1.337-1.900, P < 0.001). Kaplan-Meier survival curve showed that patients 
with SpO2 between 0.96 and 0.98 during hospitalization had a higher probability 
of survival than those patient with SpO2 < 0.96 and SpO2 > 0.98 (Log-Rank test: 
χ 2 = 113.400, P < 0.001). Sensitivity analyses demonstrated that, with the 
exception of subgroups with smaller sample sizes, across the strata of age, 
gender, body mass index (BMI), admission type, race, heart rate, systolic blood 
pressure, diastolic blood pressure, mean arterial pressure, respiratory rate, 
body temperature, myocardial infarction, congestive heart failure, 
cerebrovascular disease, chronic liver disease, diabetes mellitus, sequential 
organ failure assessment (SOFA), simplified acute physiology score II (SAPS II), 
systemic inflammatory response syndrome score (SIRS), and Glasgow coma score 
(GCS), the mortality of patients with SpO2 between 0.96 and 0.98 was 
significantly lower than those of patients with SpO2 < 0.96 and SpO2 > 0.98.
CONCLUSIONS: During hospitalization, the level of SpO2 among sepsis patients 
exhibits a U-shaped relationship with in-hospital all-cause mortality, 
indicating that heightened and diminished oxygen levels are both associated with 
increased mortality risk. The optimal SpO2 range is determined to be between 
0.96 and 0.98.

OBJECTIVE: To observe the effect of high-flow nasal cannula oxygen therapy 
(HFNC) in patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and mild 
hypercapnia, and to evaluate the early predictive ability of physiological 
parameters in these patients.
METHODS: A retrospective cohort study was conducted based on Medical Information 
Mart for Intensive Care-IV (MIMIC-IV) updated in September 2020 and the data of 
adult patients with COPD and mild hypercapnia [45 mmHg (1 mmHg = 0.133 kPa) < 
arterial partial pressure of carbon dioxide (PaCO2) ≤ 60 mmHg] from 2008 to 2019 
were collected. These patients were assigned to the HFNC group or non-invasive 
ventilation (NIV) group according to whether they received HFNC or NIV. Baseline 
data such as gender, age, body mass index (BMI), simplified acute physiology 
score II (SAPS II), Charlson comorbidity index (CCI) and physiological 
parameters were collected. A propensity score matching was conducted according 
to the baseline data of the HFNC group patients. The 48-hour and 28-day 
intubation rates, 28-day mortality, length of intensive care unit (ICU) stay, 
the length of hospital stay, and the changes in physiological parameters within 
48 hours after treatment were compared between the two groups. The receiver 
operating characteristic curve (ROC curve) was drawn and the ratio of heart rate 
over pulse oxygen saturation (HR/SpO2) and ROX index [SpO2/(inhaled oxygen 
concentration, FiO2×respiratory rate, RR)] were analyzed to predict the 24-hour 
and 48-hour intubation rates.
RESULTS: A total of 524 520 inpatient records were screened and 153 patients 
were included, while 37 patients in the HFNC group and 116 patients in NIV 
group. There were 31 patients in the HFNC group and 84 patients in the NIV group 
remained after propensity score matching according to the baseline data. There 
were no significant differences in the baseline data of gender, age, BMI, SAPS 
II, CCI score, physiological parameters and prognosis data except the length of 
ICU stay. The length of ICU stay in HFNC group was significant longer than that 
of the NIV group [days: 4.6 (3.1, 10.0) vs. 3.1 (1.6, 5.8), P < 0.05]. HR and RR 
at 40-48 hours were significantly lower than those at 0-8 hours after treatment 
only in the HFNC group [HR (bpm): 84.1±12.2 vs. 91.1±16.4, RR (times/min): 
19.8±4.9 vs. 21.6±4.1, both P < 0.05]. Both in the HFNC group and NIV group the 
pH increased (7.42±0.08 vs. 7.36±0.05 and 7.41±0.06 vs. 7.36±0.05, both P < 
0.05) and PaCO2 decreased significantly [mmHg: 46.3 (39.5, 51.0) vs. 49.8 (45.5, 
54.0) and 46.0 (40.5, 51.5) vs. 49.5 (45.5, 55.3), both P < 0.05]. The HR, PaO2 
were higher in the HFNC group than those in the HFNC group at 40-48 hours after 
treatment [HR (bpm): 91.1±15.4 vs. 84.1±12.2, PaO2 (mmHg): 99.5 (86.0, 132.3) 
vs. 85.8 (76.5, 118.0), both P < 0.05], PaO2/FiO2 were lower in the HFNC group 
than that in the HFNC group at 40-48 hours after treatment [mmHg: 223.8 (216.5, 
285.0) vs. 278.0 (212.3, 306.0), P < 0.05]. Both HR/SpO2 and ROX index at 4 
hours after treatment had predictive value for 24-hour and 48-hour intubation in 
the HFNC group. The areas under ROC curve (AUC) of HR/SpO2 at 4 hours after 
treatment in the HFNC group were larger than those of ROX index for predicting 
24-hour and 48-hour intubation (24-hour: 0.649 vs. 0.574, 48-hour: 0.692 vs. 
0.581, both P < 0.01); the 95% confidence interval (95%CI) of 4 hours HR/SpO2 
and for ROX index predicting 24 hours and 48 hours intubation were 0.497-0.780, 
0.567-0.799, 0.450-0.694 and 0.454-0.716, respectively. The high sensitivity of 
HR/SpO2 and ROX index in predicting 24-hour and 48-hour intubation were 84.6%, 
92.9%, 88.2% and 94.4%, respectively, and the low specificity were 52.3%, 23.7%, 
54.7% and 29.6%, respectively.
CONCLUSIONS: HFNC can be used in COPD patients with mild hypercapnia, but it 
cannot replace NIV. The accuracy of ROX index at 4 hours after HFNC treatment in 
predicting intubation in COPD patients with mild hypercapnia is poor.

Sepsis-3 were collected, including demography characteristics, complications, 
laboratory indicators within 24 hours after ICU admission, and final outcome. 
Using a simple random sampling method, the patients were divided into a training 
set and a validation set at a ratio of 7 : 3. The restricted cubic spline (RCS) 
was used to explore whether there was a linear relationship between each 
variable and the prognosis, and the nonlinear variables were truncated into 
categorical variables. All variables were screened by LASSO regression and 
included in multivariate Cox regression analysis to analyze the death risk 
factors in ICU patients with sepsis, and construct a nomograph. The consistency 
index, calibration curve and receiver operator characteristic curve (ROC curve) 
were used to evaluate the prediction efficiency of nomogram model. The decision 
curve analysis (DCA) was used to validate the clinical value of the model and 
its impact on actual decision-making.
RESULTS: Among 6 500 patients with sepsis, 4 551 were in the training set and 1 
949 were in the validation set. The 28-day, 90-day and 1-year mortality in the 
training set were 27.73% (1 262/4 551), 34.76% (1 582/4 551), and 42.98% (1 
956/4 551), respectively, those in the validation set were 27.24% (531/1 949), 
33.91% (661/1 949), and 42.23% (823/1 949), respectively. Both in training set 
and the validation set, compared with the final survival patients, the death 
patients were older, and had higher sequential organ failure assessment (SOFA) 
score and simplified acute physiology score II (SAPS II), more comorbidities, 
less urine output, and more use of vasoactive drugs, kidney replacement therapy, 
and mechanical ventilation. By RCS analysis, the variables with potential 
nonlinear correlation with the prognosis risk of septic patients were 
transformed into categorical variable. The variables screened by LASSO 
regression were enrolled in the multivariate Cox regression model. The results 
showed that age [hazard ratio (HR) = 1.021, 95% confidence interval (95%CI) was 
1.018-1.024], SOFA score (HR = 1.020, 95%CI was 1.000-1.040), SAPS II score > 44 
(HR = 1.480, 95%CI was 1.340-1.634), mean arterial pressure (MAP) ≤ 75 mmHg (1 
mmHg ≈ 0.133 kPa; HR = 1.120, 95%CI was 1.026-1.222), respiratory rate (RR; HR = 
1.044, 95%CI was 1.034-1.055), cerebrovascular disease (HR = 1.620, 95%CI was 
1.443-1.818), malignant tumor (HR = 1.604, 95%CI was 1.447-1.778), severe liver 
disease (HR = 1.330, 95%CI was 1.157-1.530), use of vasoactive drugs within 24 
hours (HR = 1.213, 95%CI was 1.101-1.336), arterial partial pressure of oxygen 
(PaO2; HR = 0.999, 95%CI was 0.998-1.000), blood lactic acid (Lac; HR = 1.066, 
95%CI was 1.053-1.079), blood urea nitrogen (BUN) > 8.9 mmol/L (HR = 1.257, 
95%CI was 1.144-1.381), total bilirubin (TBil; HR = 1.023, 95%CI was 
1.015-1.031), and prothrombin time (PT) > 14.5 s (HR = 1.232, 95%CI was 
1.127-1.347) were associated with the death of ICU patients with sepsis (all P < 
0.05). Based on the above factors, a nomogram model was constructed, and the 
model validation results showed that the consistency index was 0.730. The 
calibration curve showed a good consistency between the predicted results of the 
nomogram model and observed results in the training and validation sets. ROC 
curve analysis showed that the area under the ROC curve (AUC) predicted by the 
nomogram model in the training set and the validation set for 28-day, 90-day and 
1-year death risk was 0.771 (95%CI was 0.756-0.786) and 0.761 (95%CI was 
0.738-0.784), 0.777 (95%CI was 0.763-0.791) and 0.765 (95%CI was 0.744-0.787), 
0.677 (95%CI was 0.648-0.707) and 0.685 (95%CI was 0.641-0.728), respectively. 
DCA analysis showed that the nomogram model had significant net benefits in 
predicting 28-day, 90-day, and 1-year death risk, verifying the clinical value 
of the model and its good impact on actual decision-making.
CONCLUSIONS: The death risk factors related to ICU patients with sepsis include 
age, SOFA score, SAPS II score > 44, MAP ≤ 75 mmHg, RR, cerebrovascular disease, 
malignant tumors, severe liver disease, use of vasoactive drugs within 24 hours, 
PaO2, Lac, BUN, TBil, PT > 14.5 s. The nomogram model constructed based on this 
can predict the death risk of ICU patients with sepsis.

BACKGROUND: Acute kidney injury (AKI) is a frequent consequence of sepsis and 
has been linked to poor prognosis. In critically ill patients, the ratio of 
neutrophils to lymphocytes and platelets (N/LP) has been confirmed as an 
inflammation-related marker connected with the development of renal dysfunction. 
However, the effect of the N/LP ratio on the initiation and development of AKI 
in patients with sepsis remained unclear. The purpose of this study was to 
determine if the N/LP ratio on intensive care unit (ICU) admission was 
associated with the occurrence of sepsis-associated AKI (S-AKI) and severe AKI.
METHODS: Adult septic patients from the Medical Information Mart for Intensive 
Care-IV database were screened and classified into three categories (low, 
middle, or high) based on their N/LP ratio quartiles. The Cox proportional 
hazard and competing risk models were used to determine the risk of S-AKI in 
various N/LP groups, whilst the logistic regression model and restricted cubic 
splines (RCS) analysis were employed to investigate the link between N/LP ratios 
and the occurrence of severe AKI. Finally, we did a doubly robust estimation, a 
subgroup analysis, and a sensitivity analysis to determine the findings' 
robustness.
RESULTS: We categorized 485, 968, and 485 septic patients into three groups 
based on their N/LP ratios: low, intermediate, and high. According the Cox 
proportional hazard model, the hazard rate (95% CI) for those in the middle and 
high N/LP groups on the incidence of S-AKI were 1.30(1.07, 1.58) and 1.27(1.02, 
1.59), respectively, as compared to those in the low N/LP group. And the 
Fine-Gray proportional subdistribution hazards model indicated that mortality 
was not a substantial competing risk for S-AKI. Additionally, multivariate 
logistic regression revealed that the risk of severe AKI increased 1.83 fold in 
the high group compared to the low group. The RCS result also suggested that the 
probability of severe AKI rose significantly when N/LP > 9.5. The consistency of 
these findings was confirmed using doubly robust estimation. However, subgroup 
and sensitivity analyses revealed that the association between N/LP and the 
incidence of S-AKI, severe AKI varied considerably between different populations 
and diagnostic criteria.
CONCLUSION: A raised initial N/LP level may induce the development of S-AKI and 
severe AKI within 7 days after ICU admission in septic patients. These 
influences were enhanced in elder, male, septic shock, and those with poor 
health condition. Furthermore, high NLP was more strongly connected to the risk 
of S-AKI and severe AKI in sepsis patients on the urine output-based AKI 
criteria than on the serum creatinine-based criteria.

AIM: This study aims to investigated the associations between estimated plasma 
volume status (ePVS) and 30-day and 1-year mortality in intracerebral hemorrhage 
(ICH) patients, providing insights into the management in ICH.
METHODS: Data of adult ICH patients were extracted from both the Medical 
Information Mart for Intensive Care IV (MIMIC-IV) database and the Hospital 
Information System (HIS) in this retrospective cohort study. Univariate and 
multivariate Cox regression analyses, and restricted cubic spline plots (RCS) 
were conducted to explore the associations between ePVS levels and both 30-day 
and 1-year mortality, with hazard ratios (HR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) 
used for evaluation. Subgroup analyses were performed to further investigate 
these associations.
RESULTS: Among 2,512 eligible patients from the MIMIC-IV database, 655 (26.07%) 
died within 30 days, with 1,254 (49.92%) had died by the 1-year follow-up. After 
adjusting for covariates, elevated ePVS was independently associated with both 
30-day mortality (HR = 1.05, 95%CI: 1.01-1.09) and 1-year mortality (HR = 1.09, 
95% CI: 1.06-1.13). Compared to patients with ePVS levels of [4.63-5.79), those 
with ePVS levels ≥5.79 had a higher risk of 30-day mortality (HR: 1.36, 95%CI: 
1.12-1.64) and 1-year mortality (HR = 1.24, 95% CI: 1.08-1.42). Among 515 
eligible patients from the HIS, 132 (25.60%) died within 30 days, with 288 
(55.90%) mortality observed at 1-year follow-up. After adjusting for covariates, 
elevated ePVS was independently associated with both 30-day mortality 
(HR = 1.33, 95%CI: 1.23-1.43) and 1-year mortality (HR = 1.26, 95% CI: 
1.18-1.35). Comparing to patients with ePVS levels of [4.63-5.79), those with 
ePVS levels of ≥5.79 had a higher risk of 30-day mortality (HR:2.21, 95%CI: 
1.48-3.30) and 1-year mortality (HR = 2.75, 95% CI: 2.04-3.72). Additionally, 
subgroup analyses demonstrated that ePVS was significantly associated with 
30-day mortality or 1-year mortality derived from MIMIC-IV and HIS in most 
subgroups (p < 0.05). And RCS analysis indicates that, whether using MIMIC-IV or 
HIS data, ePVS was linearly associated with 30-day or 1-year mortality.
CONCLUSION: Higher ePVS levels may be a potential risk factor for 30-day and 
1-year mortality in ICH patients, suggesting that timely monitoring and 
stabilization of ePVS could improve prognosis in this population. However, 
further studies are needed to validate these fingings.

BACKGROUND: This study aims to investigate the relationship between blood urea 
nitrogen to serum albumin ratio (BAR) and all-cause mortality in patients with 
acute kidney injury (AKI) and evaluate the effect of BAR on the prognosis of 
AKI.
METHODS: Adult patients with AKI admitted to the ICU in the Medical Information 
Mart for Intensive Care IV (MIMIC-IV) were selected in a retrospective cohort 
study. BAR (mg/g) was calculated using initial blood urea nitrogen (mg/dl)/serum 
albumin (g/dl). According to the BAR, these patients were divided into quartiles 
(Q1-Q4). Kaplan-Meier analysis was used to compare the mortality of the above 
four groups. Multivariate Cox regression analysis was used to evaluate the 
association between BAR and 28-day mortality and 365-day mortality. The receiver 
operating characteristic (ROC) curve was plotted and the area under the curve 
(AUC) was calculated, and the subgroup analysis was finally stratified by 
relevant covariates.
RESULTS: A total of 12,125 patients with AKI were included in this study. The 
28-day and 365-day mortality rates were 23.89 and 39.07%, respectively. 
Kaplan-Meier analysis showed a significant increase in all-cause mortality in 
patients with high BAR (Log-rank p < 0.001). Multivariate Cox regression 
analysis showed that BAR was an independent risk factor for 28-day mortality 
(4.32 < BAR≤7.14: HR 1.12, 95% CI 0.97-1.30, p = 0.114; 7.14 < BAR≤13.03: HR 
1.51, 95% CI 1.31-1.75, p < 0.001; BAR>13.03: HR 2.07, 95% CI 1.74-2.47, 
p < 0.001; Reference BAR≤4.32) and 365-day mortality (4.32 < BAR≤7.14: HR 1.22, 
95% CI 1.09-1.36, p < 0.001; 7.14 < BAR≤13.03: HR 1.63, 95% CI 1.46-1.82, 
p < 0.001; BAR>13.03: HR 2.22, 95% CI 1.93-2.54, p < 0.001; Reference 
BAR ≤ 4.32) in patients with AKI. The AUC of BAR for predicting 28-day mortality 
and 365-day mortality was 0.649 and 0.662, respectively, which is better than 
that of blood urea nitrogen and sequential organ failure assessment. In 
addition, subgroup analysis showed a stable relationship between BAR and adverse 
outcomes in patients with AKI.
CONCLUSION: BAR is significantly associated with increased all-cause mortality 
in patients with AKI. This finding suggests that BAR may help identify people 
with AKI at high risk of mortality.

BACKGROUND: The objective of this study was to evaluate the association between 
red cell distribution width/platelet ratio (RPR) and 30-day and 1-year mortality 
in acute ischemic stroke (AIS).
METHODS: Data for the retrospective cohort study were collected from the Medical 
Information Mart for Intensive Care (MIMIC) III database. RPR was divided into 
two groups: RPR ≤ 0.11 and RPR > 0.11. The study outcomes were 30-day mortality 
and 1-year mortality from AIS. Cox proportional hazard models were utilized to 
assess the association between RPR and mortality. Subgroup analyses were applied 
based on age, tissue-type plasminogen activator (IV-tPA), endovascular 
treatment, and myocardial infarction.
RESULTS: A total of 1,358 patients were included in the study. Short- and 
long-term mortality occurred in 375 (27.61%) and 560 (41.24%) AIS patients, 
respectively. A high RPR was significantly associated with increased 30-day 
[hazard ratio (HR): 1.45, 95% confidence interval (CI): 1.10 to 1.92, P = 0.009] 
and 1-year mortality (HR: 1.54, 95%CI: 1.23 to 1.93, P < 0.001) in AIS patients. 
Meanwhile, RPR was found to be significantly related to 30-day mortality in AIS 
patients aged < 65 years (HR: 2.19, 95% CI: 1.17 to 4.10, P = 0.014), without 
IV-tPA use (HR: 1.42, 95% CI: 1.05 to 1.90, P = 0.021), without using 
endovascular treatment (HR: 1.45, 95% CI: 1.08 to 1.94, P = 0.012), and without 
myocardial infarction (HR: 1.54, 95% CI: 1.13 to 2.10, P = 0.006). Additionally, 
RPR was associated with 1-year mortality in AIS patients aged < 65 years (HR: 
2.54, 95% CI: 1.56 to 4.14, P < 0.001), aged ≥ 65 years (HR: 1.38, 95% CI: 1.06 
to 1.19, P = 0.015), with (HR: 1.46, 95% CI: 1.15 to 1.85, P = 0.002) and 
without using IV-tPA (HR: 2.30, 95% CI: 1.03 to 5.11, P = 0.041), without using 
endovascular treatment (HR: 1.56, 95% CI: 1.23 to 1.96, P < 0.001), and without 
myocardial infarction (HR: 1.68, 95% CI: 1.31 to 2.15, P < 0.001).
CONCLUSION: Elevated RPR is associated with a high risk of short-term and 
long-term mortality in AIS.

OBJECTIVE: To compare the predictive value of Oxford acute severity of illness 
score (OASIS) and simplified acute physiology score II (SAPS II) for in-hospital 
mortality in intensive care unit (ICU) patients with sepsis.
METHODS: A retrospective cohort study was conducted using the data in the 
Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care-IV 0.4 (MIMIC-IV 0.4). Based on 
Sepsis-3 diagnostic criteria, the basic information of ICU adult sepsis patients 
with infection and sequential organ failure assessment (SOFA) score ≥ 2 within 
24 hours of ICU admission admitted for the first time in the database was 
extracted, including gender, age, vasopressor drugs, sedative drugs, mechanical 
ventilation, renal replacement therapy, length of ICU stay, OASIS, SAPS II 
scores, etc. The primary outcome was in-hospital mortality. A receiver operator 
characteristic curve (ROC curve) was drawn, and the area under the ROC curve 
(AUC) was calculated to compare the prognostic value of OASIS score and SAPS II 
score.
RESULTS: A total of 11 098 adult ICU sepsis patients were enrolled in the final 
analysis, of which 2 320 died and 8 778 survived in hospital, with a mortality 
of 20.90%. Compared with the survivors, the non-survivors were older [years old: 
71 (60, 81) vs. 67 (56, 78)], had longer length of ICU stay [days: 6.95 (3.39, 
13.07) vs. 4.23 (2.19, 9.73)] and higher proportions of using vasopressor drugs, 
sedative drugs, mechanical ventilation and renal replacement therapy 
[vasopressor drugs: 50.65% (1 175/2 320) vs. 33.05% (2 901/8 778), sedative 
drugs: 58.53% (1 358/2 320) vs. 48.41% (4 249/8 778), mechanical ventilation: 
89.57% (2 078/2 320) vs. 81.66% (7 168/8 778), renal replacement therapy: 11.98% 
(278/2 320) vs. 6.57% (577/8 778), all P < 0.01]. Moreover, the non-survivors 
had higher OASIS score [43 (36, 49) vs. 35 (29, 41), P < 0.01] and SAPS II score 
[49 (40, 60) vs. 38 (31, 47), P < 0.01] as compared with the survivors. ROC 
curve analysis showed that the AUC of OASIS score and SAPS II score for 
predicting in-hospital death of ICU patients with sepsis was 0.713 [95% 
confidence interval (95%CI) was 0.701-0.725] and 0.716 (95%CI was 0.704-0.728), 
respectively, and the Delong test showed no significant difference in AUC 
between the two scoring systems (P > 0.05).
CONCLUSIONS: OASIS score has a good predictive value for in-hospital mortality 
in sepsis patients, which is similar to SAPS II score. OASIS score is simpler 
and has a broader clinical application prospect than SAPS II score.

BACKGROUND: The stress hyperglycemia ratio (SHR) has been established as a 
predictor of unfavorable outcomes across various diseases. However, its 
relationship with prognosis in patients with cardiogenic shock (CS) remains 
unclear. This study aims to investigate the association between SHR and outcomes 
in CS patients.
METHODS: A total of 904 CS patients with their first ICU admission were included 
in this study, utilizing data from the American Medical Information Mart for 
Intensive Care (MIMIC-IV) database. The primary endpoints were all-cause 
mortality at 30 days and 360 days. Patients were stratified into three groups 
based on the tertiles of the SHR.
RESULTS: The mean age of the cohort was 67.62 years, with 67.3% of participants 
being men. During the follow-up period, 221 patients (24.4%) died within 30 
days, and 360 patients (39.8%) died within 360 days. The 30-day all-cause 
mortality rates were 16.9%, 22.3%, and 34.2% in the T1, T2, and T3 groups, 
respectively (p < 0.001), while the 360-day all-cause mortality rates were 
34.9%, 39.0%, and 45.6%, respectively (p = 0.015). Compared with patients in T1, 
those in T3 exhibited a significantly higher risk of 30-day all-cause mortality 
(HR = 2.140, 95% CI: 1.522-3.008, p < 0.001) and 360-day all-cause mortality 
(HR = 1.495, 95% CI: 1.157-1.931, p = 0.002). Restricted cubic spline (RCS) 
analyses demonstrated an approximately linear relationship between SHR and 
360-day all-cause mortality (p for overall = 0.011; p for nonlinearity = 0.099). 
However, a nonlinear association was observed between SHR and 30-day all-cause 
mortality (p for overall < 0.001; p for nonlinearity = 0.030), with the risk 
increasing significantly when SHR exceeded 1.176. Subgroup analyses revealed 
that the effect of SHR was consistent across most subgroups except in patients 
with and without acute myocardial infarction (AMI). In patients with AMI, SHR 
was associated with a significantly elevated risk of mortality, whereas no 
significant association was observed in patients without AMI. For 30-day 
all-cause mortality, the HR was 1.059 (95% CI: 1.040-1.078) in patients with AMI 
and 1.002 (95% CI: 0.966-1.040) in those without AMI (p for 
interaction = 0.007). For 360-day all-cause mortality, the HR was 1.043 (95% CI: 
1.026-1.061) in patients with AMI and 0.984 (95% CI: 0.955-1.014) in those 
without AMI (p for interaction < 0.001).
CONCLUSION: Elevated SHR was significantly associated with increased 30-day and 
360-day all-cause mortality in patients with CS, particularly in those with CS 
complicated by AMI. SHR may serve as a valuable marker for risk stratification 
and guiding subsequent interventions in CS patients. However, further 
prospective studies are needed to confirm these findings.

BACKGROUND: The triglyceride-glucose (TyG) index and stress hyperglycemia ratio 
(SHR) have been linked to the cardiovascular risks in critical ill patients. 
However, little is known about the predictive power of the TyG index, SHR and 
their combination on the incidence and mortality risks of new-onset atrial 
fibrillation (NOAF) in patients with sepsis.
METHOD: This retrospective study included patients from the Medical Information 
Mart for Intensive Care (MIMIC)-IV database. Primary outcomes were defined as 
the incidence and 360-day mortality of in-hospital NOAF among patients with 
sepsis. Logistic model, Cox proportional hazard model, Kaplan-Meier analysis and 
receiver-operating characteristic (ROC) were performed to explore the 
association between the indices and clinical outcomes. Machine learning approach 
also was constructed to evaluate and compare the indices in predicting mortality 
risks.
RESULTS: 4276 patients meeting the inclusion criteria were enrolled and 764 
individuals developed NOAF during hospitalization. The multivariable adjusted 
odds ratios (95%, CI) of incidence of NOAF in patients with sepsis in the 
highest group versus the lowest group were 1.36 (1.10-1.69), 1.35 (1.09-1.67) 
and 1.58 (1.23-2.02), respectively, for the TyG index, SHR and the TyG index-SHR 
combination. However, the predictive powers of these indices were relatively 
low. Among septic patients who developed in-hospital NOAF, those in the highest 
TyG index group and the highest SHR group exhibited an increased risk of 360-day 
mortality compared with those with the lowest TyG index and the lowest SHR (the 
TyG index: hazard ratio [HR] 1.59, 95% CI 1.00-2.62; SHR: HR 1.67, 95% CI 
1.03-2.70). Patients with both the highest the TyG index and the highest SHR 
demonstrated the highest risk of 360-day mortality (HR 1.72, 95% CI 1.08-2.72). 
The ROC also confirmed the TyG index-SHR combination had more robust predictive 
power for 360-day mortality among septic patients with NOAF than the TyG index 
and SHR itself (p < 0.05). The random forest model validated that the predictive 
capability was significantly enhanced with the integration of the TyG index and 
SHR.
CONCLUSION: The TyG index and SHR were associated with the incidence of 
in-hospital NOAF during sepsis, although their predictive powers were limited. 
In septic patients with in-hospital NOAF, high levels of the TyG index and SHR 
were significantly associated with increased 360-day mortality risks, with their 
combination demonstrating superior predictive power. Joint assessments of the 
TyG index and SHR could help identify individuals at high risks of mortality 
post-discharge, enabling clinicians to prioritize follow-up care and improve 
patient management.

BACKGROUND: Ischemic stroke is a major contributor to global morbidity and 
mortality, particularly in critically ill patients in intensive care units 
(ICUs). While advances in stroke management have improved outcomes, predicting 
mortality remains challenging due to the involvement of complex metabolic and 
cardiovascular factors. The triglyceride-glucose (TyG) index, a marker for 
insulin resistance, has gained attention for its potential to predict adverse 
outcomes in stroke patients. Furthermore, the TyG-BMI index, which combines TyG 
with body mass index (BMI), may offer a more comprehensive measure by accounting 
for obesity-related metabolic burden. However, the comparative impact of these 
indices on short- and long-term mortality among critically ill ischemic stroke 
patients remains unclear.
METHODS: This retrospective cohort study analyzed data from the Medical 
Information Mart for Intensive Care IV (MIMIC-IV 3.0) database, including 1,334 
critically ill ischemic stroke patients. The patients were divided into four 
groups based on TyG and TyG-BMI quartiles, respectively. Cox proportional 
hazards models were employed to assess the association of these indices with 
30-day, 90-day, 180-day, and 1-year all-cause mortality (ACM). Kaplan-Meier 
survival analysis was used to compare survival rates across different index 
levels. We utilized restricted cubic splines (RCS) to examine the association 
between the TyG, TyG-BMI index and the specified outcomes. Furthermore, TyG and 
TyG-BMI index were utilized to establish logistic regression models for 
mortality across different time periods, and corresponding Receiver Operating 
Characteristic (ROC) curves were generated.
RESULTS: Kaplan-Meier survival analysis show that Higher TyG levels were 
associated with significantly increased mortality risk at all time points, with 
patients in the highest TyG quartile exhibiting the greatest risk. Conversely, 
patients having a lower TyG-BMI level faced a heightened risk of long-term ACM. 
The RCS analysis results demonstrated that the TyG index did not exhibit a 
statistically significant nonlinear relationship with mortality across all time 
points. However, a significant nonlinear relationship was observed between the 
TyG index and long-term mortality. From the ROC curve, it can be observed that 
TyG performs better in predicting short-term mortality. Conversely, TyG-BMI 
demonstrates superior performance in predicting long-term mortality. The 
analysis revealed that while the TyG index alone is a strong predictor of 
mortality, the TyG-BMI index enhances the ability to predict long-term outcomes.
CONCLUSION: This finding suggests both the TyG and TyG-BMI indices serve as 
valuable predictors of mortality in critically ill ischemic stroke patients. 
However, significant differences were observed across the various follow-up 
periods. Based on the distinct characteristics of these two indicators, future 
research should focus on the selective integration of TyG and TyG-BMI indices 
into clinical risk assessment models, tailored to the metabolic profiles of 
ischemic stroke patients in the ICU. This approach could enhance the precision 
of mortality risk stratification and optimize patient management strategies.

BACKGROUND: Sepsis is a common and severe disease with a high mortality rate in 
intensive care unit (ICU). The hemoglobin (HGB) level is a key parameter for 
oxygen supply in sepsis. Although HGB is associated with the progression of 
inflammation in sepsis patients, its role as a marker following sepsis treatment 
remains unclear. Here, we studied the correlation between early temporal changes 
in HGB levels and long-term mortality rates in septic patients.
METHOD: In this retrospective study of data on patients with sepsis from the 
Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care (MIMIC) IV database, the outcome was 
long-term mortality. Patients were divided based on the cut-off of the HGB 
percentage for receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve calculation. 
Kaplan-Meier (KM) survival curves and Cox proportional hazards regression models 
were used to analyse the associations between groups and outcomes. Propensity 
score matching (PSM) was used to verify the results.
RESULTS: In this study, 2042 patients with sepsis and changes in HGB levels at 
day 4 after admission compared to day 1 were enrolled and divided into two 
groups: group 1 (n = 1147) for those with reduction of HGB < 7% and group 2 
(n = 895) for those with dropping ≥ 7%. The long-term survival chances of sepsis 
with less than a 7% reduction in the proportion of HGB at day four were 
significantly higher than those of patients in the group with a reduction of 7% 
or more. After adjusting for covariates in the Cox model, the hazard ratios 
(HRs) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) for long-term all-cause mortality in 
the group with a reduction of 7% or more were as follows: 180 days [HR = 1.41, 
95% CI (1.22 to 1.63), P < 0.001]; 360 days [HR = 1.37, 95% CI (1.21 to 1.56), 
P < 0.001]; 540 days [HR = 1.35, 95% CI (1.20 to 1.53), P < 0.001]; 720 days 
[HR = 1.45, 95% CI (1.29 to 1.64), P < 0.001]. Additionally, the long-term 
survival rates, using Kaplan-Meier analysis, for the group with a reduction of 
7% or more were lower compared to the group with less than 7% reduction at 
180 days (54.3% vs. 65.3%, P < 0.001), 360 days (42.3% vs. 50.9%, P < 0.001), 
540 days (40.2% vs. 48.6%, P < 0.001), and 720 days (35.5% vs. 46.1%, 
P < 0.001). The same trend was obtained after using PSM.
CONCLUSION: A ≥ 7% decrease in HGB levels on Day 4 after admission was 
associated with worse long-term prognosis in sepsis patients admitted to the 
ICU.

OBJECTIVE: To study the influence of time-dependent acute physiology and chronic 
health evaluation II (APACHE II) score on 14-day death risk in patients with 
severe stroke, and to provide reference for clinical diagnosis and treatment.
METHODS: Data of 3 229 patients with severe stroke were enrolled from Medical 
Information Mart for Intensive Care-III (MIMIC-III). According to the main types 
of stroke, the patients were divided into subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH), 
intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH), ischemic stroke (IS) and other groups. According 
to age, patients were divided into > 60 years old and ≤ 60 years old subgroups. 
According to the baseline of sequential organ failure assessment (SOFA) score, 
they were divided into subgroups of > 3 and ≤ 3. The daily measured values of 
APACHE II scores in each patient were recorded. And all-cause death within 14 
days after admission to intensive care unit (ICU) was used as the outcome index 
to obtain the survival status and survival time of patients. Joint models for 
longitudinal and time-to-event data were established to evaluate the effect of 
APACHE II score measured at multiple time points on the death risk of patients, 
and a subgroup analysis was performed.
RESULTS: Among the joint models, the one which include APACHE II score, and the 
interaction items between APACHE II and age showed the better fitting. Further 
analysis showed that APACHE II score was affected by age, gender, hospital 
admission, baseline SOFA score and smoking history. After controlling for these 
confounding factors, APACHE II score was significantly associated with 14-day 
all-cause death in patients with severe stroke [hazard ratio (HR) = 1.48, 95% 
confidence interval (95%CI) was 1.31-1.66, P < 0.001], which indicated that the 
risk of death increased by 48% (95%CI was 31%-66%) for each 1-point increase in 
APACHE II score. Subgroup analysis showed that for different types of severe 
stroke patients, APACHE II score had a greater impact on the risk of 14-day 
death in SAH patients (HR = 1.43, 95%CI was 1.10-1.85), but had a smaller impact 
on ICH and IS groups [HR (95%CI) was 1.37 (1.15-1.64) and 1.35 (1.06-1.71), 
respectively]. There was no significant difference in APACHE II score on the 
risk of 14-day death between the patients aged > 60 years old and those aged ≤ 
60 years old [HR (95%CI): 1.37 (1.08-1.72) vs. 1.35 (1.07-1.70), respectively]. 
Compared with patients with SOFA score > 3, APACHE II score had a greater impact 
on the risk of 14-day death in patients with SOFA score ≤ 3 [HR (95%CI): 1.40 
(1.16-1.70) vs. 1.34 (1.16-1.55)].
CONCLUSIONS: Time-dependent APACHE II score is an important indicator to 
evaluate the risk of death in patients with severe stroke.

OBJECTIVE: This research aims to investigate the prognosis value using the 
time-weighted average neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio (TWA-NLR) for predicting 
all-cause hospital mortality among sepsis patients. Data were analyzed through 
the use of the eICU Collaborative Research Database (eICU-CRD 2.0) as well as 
Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care IV 2.2 (MIMIC-IV 2.2).
METHODS: Septic patients from both eICU-CRD 2.0 as well as MIMIC-IV 2.2 
databases were included. The neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratios (NLR) were 
available for analysis, utilizing complete blood counts obtained on days one, 
four, and seven following ICU admission. The TWA-NLR was computed at the end of 
the seven days, and patients were then stratified based on TWA-NLR thresholds. 
90-day all-cause mortality during hospitalization was the primary objective, 
with 60-day all-cause hospital mortality as a secondary objective. The 
correlation between TWA-NLR and sepsis patients' primary outcome was analyzed 
using univariable and multivariable Cox proportional hazard regressions. A 
restricted cubic spline (RCS) analysis was conducted in an attempt to confirm 
this association further, and subgroup analyses were employed to evaluate the 
correlation across various comorbidity groups.
RESULTS: 3921 patients were included from the eICU-CRD 2.0, and the hospital 
mortality rate was 20.8 %. Both multivariable as well as univariable Cox 
proportional hazard regression analyses revealed that TWA-NLR was independently 
correlated with 90-day all-cause hospital mortality, yielding a hazard ratio 
(HR) of 1.02 (95 % CI 1.01-1.02, P-value<0.01) as well as 1.12 (95 % CI 
1.01-1.15, P-value<0.01), respectively. The RCS analysis demonstrated a 
significant nonlinear relationship between TWA-NLR and 90-day all-cause hospital 
mortality risk. The study subjects were divided into higher (>10.5) and lower 
(≤10.5) TWA-NLR cohorts. A significantly decreased incidence of 90-day all-cause 
hospital mortality (HR = 0.56, 95 % CI 0.48-0.64, P-value<0.01) and longer 
median survival time (40 days vs 24 days, P-value<0.05) were observed in the 
lower TWA-NLR cohort. However, septic patients with chronic pulmonary 
(interaction of P-value = 0.009) or renal disease (interaction of 
P-value = 0.008) exhibited significant interactive associations between TWA-NLR 
and 90-day all-cause hospital mortality, suggesting the predictive power of 
TWA-NLR may be limited in these subgroups. The MIMIC-IV 2.2 was utilized as a 
validation cohort and exhibited a similar pattern.
CONCLUSION: Our findings suggest that TWA-NLR is a powerful and independent 
prognostic indicator for 90-day all-cause hospital mortality among septic 
patients, and the TWA-NLR cutoff value may prove a useful method for identifying 
high-risk septic patients.

Background: Sepsis, as one of the severe diseases, is frequently observed in 
critically ill patients, especially concurrent with diabetes. Whether admission 
blood glucose is associated with the prognosis, and outcome of septic patients 
is still debatable. Methods: We retrospectively reviewed and analyzed the 
demographic characteristics of septic patients in the Medical Information Mart 
for Intensive Care III (MIMIC III, version 1.4) between June 2001 and October 
2012. The Chi-square and Fisher's exact tests were used for the comparison of 
qualitative variables among septic patients with different glucose levels and 
the 30-day mortality in septic patients with diabetes or not. Univariate and 
stepwise multivariate Cox regression analyses were used to determine the risk 
factors for 30-day mortality. Kaplan-Meier analysis was conducted to reveal the 
different 30-day survival probabilities in each subgroup. Results: A total of 
2,948 septic patients (910 cases with diabetes, 2,038 cases without diabetes) 
were ultimately included in the study. The 30-day mortality was 32.4% (956/2,948 
cases) in the overall population without any difference among diabetic and 
non-diabetic septic patients (p = 1.000). Admission blood glucose levels <70 
mg/dl were only observed to be significantly associated with the 30-day 
mortality of septic patients without diabetes (hazard ratio (HR) = 2.48, p < 
0.001). After adjusting for confounders, age >65 years (HR = 1.53, p = 0.001), 
the Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (SOFA) score >5 (HR = 2.26, p < 0.001), 
lactic acid >2 mmol/L (Lac, HR = 1.35, p = 0.024), and platelet abnormality 
(<100 k/ul: HR = 1.49; >300 k/ul: HR = 1.36, p < 0.001) were the independent 
risk factors for 30-day mortality in septic patients with diabetes. In 
non-diabetes population, age >65 years (HR = 1.53, p < 0.001), non-White or 
non-Black patients (HR = 1.30, p = 0.004), SOFA score >5 (HR = 1.56, p < 0.001), 
blood glucose <70 mg/dl (HR = 1.91, p = 0.003), anion gap (AG) >2 mmol/L (HR = 
1.60, p < 0.001), Lac (HR = 1.61, p < 0.001), urea nitrogen >21 mg/dl (HR = 
1.45, p = 0.001), alanine aminotransferase (ALT, HR = 1.31, p = 0.009), total 
bilirubin >1.2 mg/dl (HR = 1.20, p = 0.033), and low hemoglobin (HR = 1.34, p = 
0.001) were the independent risk factors for 30-day mortality. Conclusions: Our 
results indicate admission blood glucose, especially in terms of <70 mg/dl, is 
the key signaling in predicting the worse 30-day survival probability of septic 
patients without diabetes, which could help clinicians to make a more suitable

OBJECTIVE: To explore the risk factors of severe acute kidney injury (AKI) in 
septic patients, and to establish an hour-specific prediction model.
METHODS: Based on the information of septic patients in the Medical Information 
Mart for Intensive Care- IV (MIMIC- IV) database, general information, 
comorbidities, vital signs, severity scoring system, laboratory indicators, 
invasive operations and medication use were recorded. The enrolled patients were 
randomized into a training set and a validation set according to a ratio of 7 : 
3. AKI was diagnosed according to the guidelines of Kidney Disease: Improving 
Global Outcome (KDIGO). Based on Lasso regression and Cox regression, the risk 
factors of severe AKI (AKI stage 2 and stage 3) in septic patients were analyzed 
and hour-specific prediction model were established. Consistency index 
(C-index), area under the receiver operator characteristic curve (AUC) and 
calibration curve were used to assess the predictive efficacy of the model.
RESULTS: A total of 20 551 septic patients were enrolled, including 14 385 
patients in the training set and 6 166 patients in the validation set. 
Multivariate Cox regression analysis showed that atrial fibrillation [hazard 
ratio (HR) = 1.266, 95% confidence interval (95%CI) was 1.150-1.393], heart 
failure (HR = 1.348, 95%CI was 1.217-1.493), respiratory failure (HR = 1.565, 
95%CI was 1.428-1.715), heart rate (HR = 1.004, 95%CI was 1.002-1.007), mean 
arterial pressure (HR = 1.245, 95%CI was 1.126-1.377), lactic acid (HR = 1.051, 
95%CI was 1.025-1.077), simplified acute physiology score II (SAPS II, HR = 
1.019, 95%CI was 1.016-1.023), serum creatinine (HR = 1.171, 95%CI was 
1.127-1.216), anion gap (HR = 1.024, 95%CI was 1.010-1.038), serum potassium (HR 
= 1.155, 95%CI was 1.079-1.236), white blood cell count (HR = 1.006, 95%CI was 
1.003-1.009) and furosemide use (HR = 0.414, 95%CI was 0.368-0.467) were 
independently associated with severe AKI in septic patients (all P < 0.01). The 
above predictors were applied to construct an hour-specific prediction model for 
the occurrence of severe AKI in septic patients. The C-index of the prediction 
model was 0.723 and 0.735 in the training and validation sets, respectively. The 
AUC for the occurrence of severe AKI at 12, 24, and 48 hours were 0.795 (95%CI 
was 0.782-0.808), 0.792 (95%CI was 0.780-0.805), and 0.775 (95%CI was 
0.762-0.788) in the training set, and the AUC were 0.803 (95%CI was 
0.784-0.823), 0.791 (95%CI was 0.772-0.810), and 0.773 (95%CI was 0.752-0.793) 
in the validation set, respectively. The calibration curves of the two cohorts 
were in good agreement.
CONCLUSIONS: The hour-specific prediction model effectively identifies high-risk 
septic patients for developing severe AKI within 48 hours, aiding clinicians in 
stratifying patients for early therapeutic interventions to improve outcomes.

BACKGROUND: Gastrointestinal bleeding (GIB) is a severe and potentially 
life-threatening complication in patients with acute myocardial infarction 
(AMI), significantly affecting prognosis during hospitalization. Early 
identification of high-risk patients is essential to reduce complications, 
improve outcomes, and guide clinical decision-making.
OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to develop and validate a machine learning 
(ML)-based model for predicting in-hospital GIB in patients with AMI, identify 
key risk factors, and evaluate the clinical applicability of the model for risk 
stratification and decision support.
METHODS: A multicenter retrospective cohort study was conducted, including 1910 
patients with AMI from the Affiliated Hospital of Guangdong Medical University 
(2005-2024). Patients were divided into training (n=1575) and testing (n=335) 
cohorts based on admission dates. For external validation, 1746 patients with 
AMI were included in the publicly available MIMIC-IV (Medical Information Mart 
for Intensive Care IV) database. Propensity score matching was adjusted for 
demographics, and the Boruta algorithm identified key predictors. A total of 7 
ML algorithms-logistic regression, k-nearest neighbors, support vector machine, 
decision tree, random forest (RF), extreme gradient boosting, and neural 
networks-were trained using 10-fold cross-validation. The models were evaluated 
for the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve, accuracy, 
sensitivity, specificity, recall, F1-score, and decision curve analysis. Shapley 
additive explanations analysis ranked variable importance. Kaplan-Meier survival 
analysis evaluated the impact of GIB on short-term survival. Multivariate 
logistic regression assessed the relationship between coronary heart disease 
(CHD) and in-hospital GIB after adjusting for clinical variables.
RESULTS: The RF model outperformed other ML models, achieving an area under the 
receiver operating characteristic curve of 0.77 in the training cohort, 0.77 in 
the testing cohort, and 0.75 in the validation cohort. Key predictors included 
red blood cell count, hemoglobin, maximal myoglobin, hematocrit, CHD, and other 
variables, all of which were strongly associated with GIB risk. Decision curve 
analysis demonstrated the clinical use of the RF model for early risk 
stratification. Kaplan-Meier survival analysis showed no significant differences 
in 7- and 15-day survival rates between patients with AMI with and without GIB 
(P=.83 for 7-day survival and P=.87 for 15-day survival). Multivariate logistic 
regression showed that CHD was an independent risk factor for in-hospital GIB 
(odds ratio 2.79, 95% CI 2.09-3.74). Stratified analyses by sex, age, 
occupation, marital status, and other subgroups consistently showed that the 
association between CHD and GIB remained robust across all subgroups.
CONCLUSIONS: The ML-based RF model provides a robust and clinically applicable 
tool for predicting in-hospital GIB in patients with AMI. By leveraging 
routinely available clinical and laboratory data, the model supports early risk 
stratification and personalized preventive strategies.

OBJECTIVE: To explore the basic characteristics of various types of intensive 
care unit (ICU) patients and the predictive value of six common disease severity 
scores in critically ill patients on the first day on the 28-day death risk.
METHODS: The general information, disease severity scores [acute physiology 
score III (APS III), Oxford acute disease severity (OASIS) score, Logistic organ 
dysfunction score (LODS), simplified acute physiology score II (SAPS II), 
systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS) score and sequential organ 
failure assessment (SOFA) score], prognosis and other indicators of critically 
ill patients admitted from 2008 to 2019 were extracted from Medical Information 
Mart for Intensive Care-IV 2.0 (MIMIC-IV 2.0). The receiver operator 
characteristic curve (ROC curve) of six critical illness scores for 28-day death 
risk of patients in various ICU, and the area under the ROC curve (AUC) was 
calculated, the optimal Youden index was used to determine the cut-off value, 
and the AUC of various ICU was verified by Delong method.
RESULTS: A total of 53 150 critically ill patients were enrolled, with medical 
ICU (MICU) accounted for the most (19.25%, n = 10 233), followed by cardiac 
vascular ICU (CVICU) with 17.78%(n = 9 450), and neurological ICU (NICU) 
accounted for the least (6.25%, n = 3 320). The patients in coronary care unit 
(CCU) were the oldest [years old: 71.79 (60.27, 82.33)]. The length of ICU stay 
in NICU was the longest [days: 2.84 (1.51, 5.49)] and accounted for the highest 
proportion of total length of hospital stay [63.51% (34.61%, 97.07%)]. The 
patients in comprehensive ICU had the shortest length of ICU stay [days: 1.75 
(0.99, 3.05)]. The patients in CVICU had the lowest proportion of length of ICU 
stay to total length of hospital stay [27.69% (18.68%, 45.18%)]. The six scores 
within the first day of ICU admission in NICU patients were lower than those in 
the other ICU, while APS III, LODS, OASIS, and SOFA scores in MICU patients were 
higher than those in the other ICU. SAP II and SIRS scores were both the highest 
in CVICU, respectively. In terms of prognosis, MICU patients had the highest 
28-day mortality (14.14%, 1 447/10 233), while CVICU patients had the lowest 
(2.88%, 272/9 450). ROC curve analysis of the predictive value of each score on 
the 28-day death risk of various ICU patients showed that, the predictive value 
of APS III, LODS, and SAPS II in comprehensive ICU were higher [AUC and 95% 
confidence interval (95%CI) were 0.84 (0.83-0.85), 0.82 (0.81-0.84), and 0.83 
(0.82-0.84), respectively]. The predictive value of OASIS, LODS, and SAPS II in 
surgical ICU (SICU) were higher [AUC and 95%CI were 0.80 (0.79-0.82), 0.79 
(0.78-0.81), and 0.79 (0.77-0.80), respectively]. The predictive value of APS 
III and SAPS II in MICU were higher [AUC and 95%CI were 0.84 (0.82-0.85) and 
0.82 (0.81-0.83), respectively]. The predictive value of APS III and SAPS II in 
CCU were higher [AUC and 95%CI were 0.86 (0.85-0.88) and 0.85 (0.83-0.86), 
respectively]. The predictive value of LODS and SAPS II in trauma ICU (TICU) 
were higher [AUC and 95%CI were 0.83 (0.82-0.83) and 0.83 (0.82-0.84), 
respectively]. The predictive value of OASIS and SAPS II in NICU were higher 
[AUC and 95%CI were 0.83 (0.80-0.85) and 0.81 (0.78-0.83), respectively]. The 
predictive value of APS III, LODS, and SAPS II in CVICU were higher [AUC and 
95%CI were 0.84 (0.83-0.85), 0.81 (0.80-0.82), and 0.78 (0.77-0.78), 
respectively].
CONCLUSIONS: For the patients in comprehensive ICU, MICU, CCU, and CVICU, APS 
III or SAPS II can be applied for predicting 28-day death risk. For the patients 
in SICU and NICU, OASIS or SAPS II can be applied to predict 28-day death risk. 
For the patients in TICU, SAPS II or LODS can be applied for predicting 28-day 
death risk. For CVICU patients, APS III or LODS can be applied to predict 28-day 
death risk.

OBJECTIVE: To investigate the relationship between 1-hour lactate (1 h Lac) and 
30-day mortality in critical care patients in intensive care unit (ICU).
METHODS: A retrospective, observational cohort study was performed with adult 
critical patients (age ≥ 16 years old) having lactate records within 1 hour 
after ICU admission from Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care-III 
database (MIMIC-III). According to the 1 h Lac level, the patients were divided 
into three groups: < 2 mmol/L, 2-4 mmol/L, and > 4 mmol/L groups. The baseline 
characteristics were analyzed. Multivariable Logistic regression analysis was 
performed to assess the association between 1 h Lac and 30-day mortality. The 
receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve was used to analyze the predictive 
value of 1 h Lac for 30-day mortality, and Kaplan-Meier survival curve was 
performed according to the best cut-off value. In addition, sensitivity analysis 
was carried out for each classification variable.
RESULTS: A total of 3 969 ICU patients were included, with 673 died in 30 days, 
and the total mortality was 16.95%. There were 1 664, 1 588, 717 patients in Lac 
< 2 mmol/L, 2-4 mmol/L and > 4 mmol/L group, respectively. There were 
significant differences in age, ICU duration, ICU type, heart rate, leukocyte 
count, hemoglobin, creatinine, sequential organ failure score (SOFA), ventilator 
application, vasoactive drug use and main diagnosis among the three groups. 
Multivariable Logistic regression analysis showed that a 1 mmol/L increment in 
Lac was associated with 0.24 times higher risk of 30-day mortality [odds ratio 
(OR) = 1.24, 95% confidence interval (95%CI) was 1.19-1.29, P < 0.000 1]. ROC 
curve analysis showed that the area under ROC curve (AUC) of 1 h Lac for 
predicting 30-day mortality of severe patients was 0.694 (95%CI was 
0.669-0.718). The cut-off value was 3.35 mmol/L with sensitivity of 0.499 and 
specificity of 0.779, whilst positive likelihood ratio was 2.260, and negative 
likelihood ratio was 0.643. According to the cut-off value of 1 h Lac, the 
patients were divided into high lactate group (≥ 3.35 mmol/L) and low lactate 
group (< 3.35 mmol/L). In the two subgroups, 30-day mortality was 31.58% (336/1 
064) and 11.60% (337/2 905), respectively. The Kaplan-Meier survival curve 
showed that the 30-day cumulative survival rate of high lactate group was 
significantly lower than that of low lactate group (Log-rank test: χ2 = 247.72, 
P < 0.000 1). Multiple Logistic regression analysis showed that the 30-day 
mortality rate of high lactate group was 2.34 times that the level of low 
lactate group (OR = 2.34, 95%CI was 1.90-2.88, P < 0.000 1), after the 
adjustment of age, time of admission, type of ICU, hemoglobin, leukocyte count, 
use of vasopressor, use of ventilator and main diagnosis of patients. Stratified 
analysis showed that the relationship between 1 h Lac and 30-day mortality was 
stable.
CONCLUSIONS: 1 h Lac is associated with 30-day mortality in critical care 
patients. The risk of death was significantly increased in critically ill 
patients with 1 h Lac higher than 3.35 mmol/L.

AIMS: The effect of changes in serum sodium levels on the survival of patients 
with heart failure (HF) is unclear. We aimed to analyse the impact of serum 
sodium level trajectories on survival in intensive care unit (ICU) patients with 
HF.
METHODS: A total of 4760 patients diagnosed with HF between 2001 and 2012 from 
the Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care III (MIMIC-III) database were 
extracted. Of these patients, 1132 patients who died within 48 h of ICU 
admission were excluded, and 3628 patients were included in this retrospective 
cohort study. Sodium levels were measured at baseline, 6, 12, 18, 24, 30, 36, 
42, and 48 h. Patients were divided into hyponatremia, normal, and hypernatremia 
groups based on baseline sodium levels, and trajectory modelling was performed 
for each group separately. Group-based trajectory model (GBTM) method was 
utilized to identify serum sodium levels trajectories.
RESULTS: The number of patients with hyponatremia (<135 mmol/L), normal sodium 
levels (135-145 mmol/L), and hypernatremia (>145 mmol/L) at baseline were 594 
(16.37%), 2,738 (75.47%), and 296 (8.16%), respectively. A total of seven 
trajectory groups were identified, including hyponatremia-slow rise group 
[initial levels (IL), 128.48 ± 5.42 mmol/L; end levels (EL), 
131.23 ± 3.83 mmol/L], hyponatremia-rapid rise to normal group (IL, 
132.13 ± 2.18 mmol/L; EL, 137.46 ± 3.68 mmol/L), normal-slow decline group (IL, 
137.65 ± 2.15 mmol/L; EL, 134.50 ± 2.54 mmol/L), normal-steady-state group (IL, 
139.20 ± 2.26 mmol/L; EL, 139.04 ± 2.58 mmol/L), normal-slow rise group (IL, 
140.94 ± 2.37 mmol/L; EL, 143.43 ± 2.89 mmol/L), hypernatremia-rapid decline to 
normal group (IL, 146.31 ± 1.98 mmol/L; EL, 140.71 ± 3.61 mmol/L), and 
hypernatremia-slow decline group (IL, 148.89 ± 5.54 mmol/L; EL, 
146.28 ± 3.90 mmol/L). The results showed that hyponatremia-slow rise group 
[hazard ratio (HR) = 1.35; 95% confidence interval (CI), 1.01-1.80, P = 0.040], 
hyponatremia-rapid rise to normal group (HR = 1.37; 95% CI, 1.11-1.71, 
P = 0.004), hypernatremia-rapid decline to normal group (HR = 1.46; 95% CI, 
1.08-1.97, P = 0.014), and hypernatremia-slow decline group (HR = 1.49; 95% CI, 
1.07-2.07, P = 0.018) trajectories were associated with an increased risk of 
1-year mortality in HF patients compared with normal-steady-state group. After 
adjustment for all confounders, hyponatremia-rapid rise to normal group 
(HR = 1.26, 95% CI; 1.01-1.57, P = 0.038) and hypernatremia-rapid decline to 
normal group (HR = 1.36; 95% CI, 1.01-1.84, P = 0.047) trajectories were still 
related to an increased risk of 1-year mortality in patients with HF.
CONCLUSIONS: Serum sodium level trajectories were associated with mortality in 
patients with HF. Association between serum sodium level trajectories and 
prognosis in patients with HF deserve further study.

OBJECTIVE: To investigate the correlation of monocyte/lymphocyte ratio (MLR) 
with the prognosis and adverse event in critically ill patients.
METHODS: Basic information of patients were extracted from Medical Information 
Mart for Intensive Care-III (MIMIC-III), including demographics, blood routine, 
biochemical indexes, systemic inflammatory response syndrome score (SIRS), 
sequential organ failure assessment (SOFA) score, and outcome, etc. MLR on the 
first day of intensive care unit (ICU) admission was calculated. The receiver 
operating characteristic curve (ROC curve) was applied to evaluate the 
prognostic value of MLR on the 30-day mortality and its cut-off value. According 
to the cut-off value, the patients were divided into two groups, and the 
differences between the groups were compared. Logistic regression model was used 
to analyze the relationship of MLR with 30-day mortality, continuous renal 
replacement therapy (CRRT), mechanical ventilation, the length of ICU stay, and 
total hospitalization time.
RESULTS: (1) A total of 43 174 critically ill patients were included. ROC curve 
showed that area under ROC curve (AUC) of MLR in predicting 30-day mortality was 
0.655 [95% confidence interval (95%CI) was 0.632-0.687]. The cut-off value of 
MLR calculated according to the maximum Yoden index was 0.5. There were 16 948 
patients with MLR ≥ 0.5 (high MLR group) and 26 226 patients with MLR < 0.5 (low 
MLR group). (2) Compared with the low MLR group, the high MLR group had higher 
age, proportion of male, body mass index (BMI) [age (years old): 66.0 (51.7, 
78.4) vs. 57.6 (27.1, 74.6), proportion of male: 57.2% vs. 52.5%, BMI (kg/m2): 
26.5 (22.5, 31.1) vs. 24.7 (14.3, 29.7)]. The high MLR group also had higher 
incidence of complications (hypertension: 49.2% vs. 44.6%, chronic heart 
failure: 32.6% vs. 21.7%, diabetes mellitus: 27.0% vs. 23.4%, chronic 
obstructive pulmonary disease: 21.5% vs. 16.1%, renal insufficiency: 19.3% vs. 
13.1%), and higher white blood cell count (WBC), blood glucose, lactate (Lac), 
serum creatinine (SCr), SIRS score and SOFA score [WBC (×109/L): 13.8 (9.6, 
19.2) vs. 11.5 (8.4, 15.6), blood glucose (mmol/L): 8.66 (6.88, 11.49) vs. 8.27 
(6.55, 10.88), Lac (mmol/L): 2.2 (1.5, 3.7) vs. 2.1 (1.4, 3.3), SCr (μmol/L): 
106.1 (70.7, 176.8) vs. 88.4 (70.7, 132.6), SIRS score: 3 (2, 4) vs. 2 (2, 3), 
SOFA score: 4 (2, 7) vs. 3 (1, 5)]. The 30-day mortality, and the proportion of 
patients with length of ICU stay > 5 days, total hospitalization time > 14 days, 
CRRT and mechanical ventilation > 5 days were significantly higher in high MLR 
group (30-day mortality: 20.0% vs. 8.3%, length of ICU stay > 5 days: 33.2% vs. 
20.4%, total hospitalization time > 14 days: 33.7% vs. 16.2%, CRRT: 3.6% vs. 
0.7%, mechanical ventilation > 5 days: 18.4% vs. 5.7%), with statistically 
significant differences (all P < 0.05). (3) After adjusted with the related 
factors, multivariate Logistic regression analysis showed that elevated MLR was 
an independent risk factor for increased 30-day mortality [odd ratio (OR) = 
1.54, 95%CI was 1.37-1.72, P < 0.001]. Moreover, the increased MLR was 
independently associated with the increased risk of usage of CRRT (OR = 2.77, 
95%CI was 2.18-3.51), mechanical ventilation > 5 days (OR = 2.45, 95%CI was 
2.21-2.72), the length of ICU stay > 5 days (OR = 2.29, 95%CI was 2.10-2.49), 
and total hospitalization time > 14 days (OR = 2.28, 95%CI was 2.08-2.49), all P 
< 0.001.
CONCLUSIONS: Retrospective analysis of large sample shows that MLR elevation is 
an independent risk factor for 30-day mortality, usage of CRRT, prolonged 
mechanical ventilation time, prolonged hospitalization, prolonged length of ICU 
stay. MLR can be used for risk stratification of severe patients.

OBJECTIVE: To construct and validate the best predictive model for 28-day death 
risk in patients with septic shock based on different supervised machine 
learning algorithms.
METHODS: The patients with septic shock meeting the Sepsis-3 criteria were 
selected from Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care-IV v2.0 (MIMIC-IV 
v2.0). According to the principle of random allocation, 70% of these patients 
were used as the training set, and 30% as the validation set. Relevant 
predictive variables were extracted from three aspects: demographic 
characteristics and basic vital signs, serum indicators within 24 hours of 
intensive care unit (ICU) admission and complications possibly affecting 
indicators, functional scoring and advanced life support. The predictive 
efficacy of models constructed using five mainstream machine learning algorithms 
including decision tree classification and regression tree (CART), random forest 
(RF), support vector machine (SVM), linear regression (LR), and super learner 
[SL; combined CART, RF and extreme gradient boosting (XGBoost)] for 28-day death 
in patients with septic shock was compared, and the best algorithm model was 
selected. The optimal predictive variables were determined by intersecting the 
results from LASSO regression, RF, and XGBoost algorithms, and a predictive 
model was constructed. The predictive efficacy of the model was validated by 
drawing receiver operator characteristic curve (ROC curve), the accuracy of the 
model was assessed using calibration curves, and the practicality of the model 
was verified through decision curve analysis (DCA).
RESULTS: A total of 3 295 patients with septic shock were included, with 2 164 
surviving and 1 131 dying within 28 days, resulting in a mortality of 34.32%. Of 
these, 2 307 were in the training set (with 792 deaths within 28 days, a 
mortality of 34.33%), and 988 in the validation set (with 339 deaths within 28 
days, a mortality of 34.31%). Five machine learning models were established 
based on the training set data. After including variables at three aspects, the 
area under the ROC curve (AUC) of RF, SVM, and LR machine learning algorithm 
models for predicting 28-day death in septic shock patients in the validation 
set was 0.823 [95% confidence interval (95%CI) was 0.795-0.849], 0.823 (95%CI 
was 0.796-0.849), and 0.810 (95%CI was 0.782-0.838), respectively, which were 
higher than that of the CART algorithm model (AUC = 0.750, 95%CI was 
0.717-0.782) and SL algorithm model (AUC = 0.756, 95%CI was 0.724-0.789). Thus 
above three algorithm models were determined to be the best algorithm models. 
After integrating variables from three aspects, 16 optimal predictive variables 
were identified through intersection by LASSO regression, RF, and XGBoost 
algorithms, including the highest pH value, the highest albumin (Alb), the 
highest body temperature, the lowest lactic acid (Lac), the highest Lac, the 
highest serum creatinine (SCr), the highest Ca2+, the lowest hemoglobin (Hb), 
the lowest white blood cell count (WBC), age, simplified acute physiology score 
III (SAPS III), the highest WBC, acute physiology score III (APS III), the 
lowest Na+, body mass index (BMI), and the shortest activated partial 
thromboplastin time (APTT) within 24 hours of ICU admission. ROC curve analysis 
showed that the Logistic regression model constructed with above 16 optimal 
predictive variables was the best predictive model, with an AUC of 0.806 (95%CI 
was 0.778-0.835) in the validation set. The calibration curve and DCA curve 
showed that this model had high accuracy and the highest net benefit could reach 
0.3, which was significantly outperforming traditional models based on single 
functional score [APS III score, SAPS III score, and sequential organ failure 
assessment (SOFA) score] with AUC (95%CI) of 0.746 (0.715-0.778), 0.765 
(0.734-0.796), and 0.625 (0.589-0.661), respectively.
CONCLUSIONS: The Logistic regression model, constructed using 16 optimal 
predictive variables including pH value, Alb, body temperature, Lac, SCr, Ca2+, 
Hb, WBC, SAPS III score, APS III score, Na+, BMI, and APTT, is identified as the 
best predictive model for the 28-day death risk in patients with septic shock. 
Its performance is stable, with high discriminative ability and accuracy.

OBJECTIVE: To establish an acute kidney injury (AKI) prediction model in 
patients after cardiac surgery by extreme gradient boosting (XGBoost) machine 
learning model, and to explore the risk and protective factors for AKI in 
patients after cardiac surgery.
METHODS: All patients who underwent cardiac surgery in Medical Information Mart 
for Intensive Care-III (MIMIC-III) database were enrolled, and they were divided 
into AKI group and non-AKI group according to whether AKI developed within 14 
days after cardiac surgery. Their clinical characteristics were compared. Based 
on five-fold cross-validation, XGBoost and Logistic regression were used to 
establish the prediction model of AKI after cardiac surgery. And the area under 
the receiver operator characteristic curve (AUC) of the models was compared. The 
output model of XGBoost was interpreted by Shapley additive explanations (SHAP).
RESULTS: A total of 6 912 patients were included, of which 5 681 (82.2%) 
developed AKI within 14 days after the operation, and 1 231 (17.8%) did not. 
Compared with the non-AKI group, the main characteristics of AKI group included 
older age [years: 68.0 (59.0, 76.0) vs. 62.0 (52.0, 71.0)], higher incidence of 
emergency admission and complicated with obesity and diabetes (52.4% vs. 47.8%, 
9.0% vs. 4.0%, 32.0% vs. 22.2%), lower respiratory rate [RR; bpm: times/min: 
17.0 (14.0, 20.0) vs. 19.0 (15.0, 22.0)], lower heart rate [HR; bpm: 80.0 (67.0, 
89.0) vs. 82.0 (71.5, 93.0)], higher blood pressure [mmHg (1 mmHg ≈ 0.133 kPa): 
80.0 (70.7, 90.0) vs. 78.0 (70.0, 88.0)], higher hemoglobin (Hb), blood glucose, 
blood K+ level and serum creatinine [SCr; Hb (g/L): 122.0 (109.0, 136.0) vs. 
120.0 (106.0, 135.0), blood glucose (mmol/L): 7.3 (6.1, 8.9) vs. 6.8 (5.7, 8.5), 
blood K+ level (mmol/L): 4.2 (3.9, 4.7) vs. 4.2 (3.8, 4.6), SCr (μmol/L): 88.4 
(70.7, 106.1) vs. 79.6 (70.7, 97.2)], lower albumin (ALB) and triacylglycerol 
[TG; ALB (g/L): 38.0 (35.0, 41.0) vs. 39.0 (37.0, 42.0), TG (mmol/L): 1.4 (1.0, 
2.0) vs. 1.5 (1.0, 2.2)] as well as higher incidence of multiple organ 
dysfunction syndrome (MODS) and sepsis (30.6% vs. 16.2%, 3.3% vs. 1.9%), with 
significant differences (all P < 0.05). In the output model of Logistic 
regression, important predictors were lactic acid [Lac; odds ratio (OR) = 1.062, 
95% confidence interval (95%CI) was 1.030-1.100, P = 0.005], obesity (OR = 
2.234, 95%CI was 1.900-2.640, P < 0.001), male (OR = 0.858, 95%CI was 
0.794-0.928, P = 0.049), diabetes (OR = 1.820, 95%CI was 1.680-1.980, P < 0.001) 
and emergency admission (OR = 1.278, 95%CI was 1.190-1.380, P < 0.001). Receiver 
operator characteristic curve (ROC curve) analysis showed that the AUC of the 
Logistic regression model for predicting AKI after cardiac surgery was 0.62 
(95%CI was 0.61-0.67). After optimizing the XGBoost model parameters by grid 
search combined with five-fold cross-validation, the model was trained well with 
no overfitting or overfitting. ROC analysis showed that the AUC of XGBoost model 
for predicting AKI after cardiac surgery was 0.77 (95%CI was 0.75-0.80), which 
was significantly higher than that of Logistic regression model (P < 0.01). 
After SHAP treatment, in the output model of XGBoost, age and ALB were the most 
important predictors of the final outcome, where age was the risk factor 
(average |SHAP value| was 0.434), and ALB was the protective factor (average 
|SHAP value| was 0.221).
CONCLUSIONS: Age is an important risk factor for AKI after cardiac surgery, and 
ALB is a protective factor. The performance of machine learning in predicting 
cardiac and vascular surgery-associated AKI is better than the traditional 
Logistic regression. XGBoost can analyze the more complex relationship between 
variables and outcomes, and can predict the risk of postoperative AKI more 
accurately and individually.
