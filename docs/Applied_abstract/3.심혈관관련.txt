BACKGROUND: Insulin resistance (IR) can be effectively assessed using the 
dependable surrogate biomarker triglyceride-glucose (TyG) index. In various 
critical care contexts, like contrast-induced acute kidney injury (AKI), an 
elevated TyG index has demonstrated a robust correlation with the incidence of 
AKI. Nonetheless, the potential of the TyG index to predict AKI in critically 
ill patients with heart failure (HF) remains uncertain.
METHODS: A cohort of participants was non-consecutively selected from the 
Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care IV (MIMIC-IV) database and divided 
into quartiles based on their TyG index values. The incidence of AKI was the 
primary outcome. The secondary endpoint was in-hospital mortality within both 
the whole study population and the subset of AKI patients. The use of the renal 
replacement therapy (RRT) which represented the progression of AKI severity was 
also included as a secondary endpoint representing renal outcome. A restricted 
cubic splines model and Cox proportional hazards models were utilized to 
evaluate the association of TyG index with the risk of AKI in patients with HF 
in a critical condition. Kaplan-Meier survival analysis was employed to estimate 
primary and secondary endpoint disparities across groups differentiated by their 
TyG index.
RESULTS: This study included a total of 1,393 patients, with 59% being male. The 
incidence of AKI was 82.8%. Cox proportional hazards analyses revealed a 
significant association between TyG index and the incidence of AKI in critically 
ill patients with HF. The restricted cubic splines model illustrated the linear 
relationship between higher TyG index and increased risk of AKI in this specific 
patient population. Furthermore, the Kaplan-Meier survival analyses unveiled 
statistically significant differences in the use of RRT across the subset of AKI 
patients based on the quartiles of the TyG index.
CONCLUSIONS: The results highlight the TyG index as a robust and independent 
predictor of the incidence of AKI and poor renal outcome in patients with HF in 
a critical condition. However, further confirmation of causality necessitates 
larger prospective studies.

BACKGROUND: The triglyceride glucose-body mass (TyG-BMI) index is acknowledged 
as both a reliable indicator of the risk of cardiovascular disease and an 
accurate surrogate biomarker for evaluating insulin resistance (IR). The 
importance of the TyG-BMI index among people with heart failure (HF), however, 
requires more investigation. The objective of this study was to inquire about 
the relationship between HF patients' TyG-BMI index and their risk of 360-day 
mortality.
METHODS: The Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care (MIMIC-IV) database 
provided the study's patient data, which were divided into quartiles according 
to their TyG-BMI index. The endpoint was mortality from all causes within 360 
days. Kaplan-Meier analysis was used to compare this primary endpoint amongst 
the four groups indicated above. The association between the TyG-BMI index and 
the endpoint was investigated using restricted cubic splines and Cox 
proportional hazards analysis.
RESULTS: The study enrolled a total of 423 patients with HF (59.2% male), of 
whom 70 patients (16.9%) died within 360 days. Patients with higher TyG-BMI 
indexes had significantly lower mortality risks, according to the Kaplan-Meier 
analysis (log-rank P = 0.003). Furthermore, the restricted cubic spline analysis 
illustrated a decrease in the risk of all-cause mortality with an increasing 
TyG-BMI index. Additionally, multivariable Cox proportional hazards analyses 
showed that the risk of 360-day death from all causes was considerably higher in 
the lowest quartile of TyG-BMI. In comparison to the lowest TyG-BMI group, the 
fully adjusted Cox model yielded a hazard ratio (HR) of 0.24 (95% CI: 0.10, 
0.59; p = 0.002) for 360-day mortality.
CONCLUSIONS: In patients diagnosed with HF, a lower TyG-BMI index is strongly 
related to a higher risk of 360-day mortality. This index can be employed to 
categorize the risk levels of patients with HF and predict their one-year 
all-cause mortality .

BACKGROUND: Among patients with acute coronary syndrome and percutaneous 
coronary intervention, stress hyperglycemia ratio (SHR) is primarily associated 
with short-term unfavorable outcomes. However, the relationship between SHR and 
long-term worsen prognosis in acute myocardial infarction (AMI) patients 
admitted in intensive care unit (ICU) are not fully investigated, especially in 
those with different ethnicity. This study aimed to clarify the association of 
SHR with all-cause mortality in critical AMI patients from American and Chinese 
cohorts.
METHODS: Overall 4,337 AMI patients with their first ICU admission from the 
American Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care (MIMIC)-IV database 
(n = 2,166) and Chinese multicenter registry cohort Cardiorenal ImprovemeNt II 
(CIN-II, n = 2,171) were included in this study. The patients were divided into 
4 groups based on quantiles of SHR in both two cohorts.
RESULTS: The total mortality was 23.8% (maximum follow-up time: 12.1 years) in 
American MIMIC-IV and 29.1% (maximum follow-up time: 14.1 years) in Chinese 
CIN-II. In MIMIC-IV cohort, patients with SHR of quartile 4 had higher risk of 
1-year (adjusted hazard radio [aHR] = 1.87; 95% CI: 1.40-2.50) and long-term 
(aHR = 1.63; 95% CI: 1.27-2.09) all-cause mortality than quartile 2 (as 
reference). Similar results were observed in CIN-II cohort (1-year mortality: 
aHR = 1.44; 95%CI: 1.03-2.02; long-term mortality: aHR = 1.32; 95%CI: 
1.05-1.66). In both two group, restricted cubic splines indicated a J-shaped 
correlation between SHR and all-cause mortality. In subgroup analysis, SHR was 
significantly associated with higher 1-year and long-term all-cause mortality 
among patients without diabetes in both MIMIC-IV and CIN-II cohort.
CONCLUSION: Among critical AMI patients, elevated SHR is significantly 
associated with and 1-year and long-term all-cause mortality, especially in 
those without diabetes, and the results are consistently in both American and 
Chinese cohorts.

BACKGROUND: New-onset atrial fibrillation (NOAF) is the most common arrhythmia 
in critically ill patients admitted to intensive care and is associated with 
poor prognosis and disease burden. Identifying high-risk individuals early is 
crucial. This study aims to create and validate a NOAF prediction model for 
critically ill patients using machine learning (ML).
METHODS: The data came from two non-overlapping datasets from the Medical 
Information Mart for Intensive Care (MIMIC), with MIMIC-IV used for training and 
subset of MIMIC-III used as external validation. LASSO regression was used for 
feature selection. Eight ML algorithms were employed to construct the prediction 
model. Model performance was evaluated based on identification, calibration, and 
clinical application. The SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) method was used 
for visualizing model characteristics and individual case predictions.
RESULTS: Among 16,528 MIMIC-IV patients, 1520 (9.2%) developed AF post-ICU 
admission. A model with 23 variables was built, with XGBoost performing best, 
achieving an AUC of 0.891 (0.873-0.888) in validation and 0.769 (0.756-0.782) in 
external validation. Key predictors included age, mechanical ventilation, urine 
output, sepsis, blood urea nitrogen, percutaneous arterial oxygen saturation, 
continuous renal replacement therapy and weight. A risk probability greater than 
0.6 was defined as high risk. A friendly user interface had been developed for 
clinician use.
CONCLUSION: We developed a ML model to predict the risk of NOAF in critically 
ill patients without cardiac surgery and validated its potential as a clinically 
reliable tool. SHAP improves the interpretability of the model, enables 
clinicians to better understand the causes of NOAF, helps clinicians to prevent 
it in advance and improves patient outcomes.

BACKGROUND: Heart failure (HF) combined with hypertension is an extremely 
important cause of in-hospital mortality, especially for the intensive care unit 
(ICU) patients. However, under intense working pressure, the medical staff are 
easily overwhelmed by the large number of clinical signals generated in the ICU, 
which may lead to treatment delay, sub-optimal care, or even wrong clinical 
decisions. Individual risk stratification is an essential strategy for managing 
ICU patients with HF combined with hypertension. Artificial intelligence, 
especially machine learning (ML), can develop superior models to predict the 
prognosis of these patients. This study aimed to develop a machine learning 
method to predict the 28-day mortality for ICU patients with HF combined with 
hypertension.
METHODS: We enrolled all critically ill patients with HF combined with 
hypertension in the Medical Information Mart for IntensiveCare Database-IV 
(MIMIC-IV, v.1.4) and the eICU Collaborative Research Database (eICU-CRD) from 
2008 to 2019. Subsequently, MIMIC-IV was divided into training cohort and 
testing cohort in an 8:2 ratio, and eICU-CRD was designated as the external 
validation cohort. The least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) 
Cox regression with internal tenfold cross-validation was used for data 
dimension reduction and identifying the most valuable predictive features for 
28-day mortality. Based on its accuracy and area under the curve (AUC), the best 
model in the validation cohort was selected. In addition, we utilized the 
Shapley Additive Explanations (SHAP) method to highlight the importance of model 
features, analyze the impact of individual features on model output, and 
visualize an individual's Shapley values.
RESULTS: A total of 3,458 and 6582 patients with HF combined with hypertension 
in MIMIC-IV and eICU-CRD were included. The patients, including 1,756 males, had 
a median (Q1, Q3) age of 75 (65, 84) years. After selection, 22 out of a total 
of 58 clinical parameters were extracted to develop the machine-learning models. 
Among four constructed models, the Neural Networks (NN) model performed the best 
predictive performance with an AUC of 0.764 and 0.674 in the test cohort and 
external validation cohort, respectively. In addition, a simplified model 
including seven variables was built based on NN, which also had good predictive 
performance (AUC: 0.741). Feature importance analysis showed that age, 
mechanical ventilation (MECHVENT), chloride, bun, anion gap, paraplegia, rdw 
(RDW), hyperlipidemia, peripheral capillary oxygen saturation (SpO2), 
respiratory rate, cerebrovascular disease, heart rate, white blood cell (WBC), 
international normalized ratio (INR), mean corpuscular hemoglobin concentration 
(MCHC), glucose, AIDS, mean corpuscular volume (MCV), N-terminal pro-brain 
natriuretic peptide (Npro. BNP), calcium, renal replacement therapy (RRT), and 
partial thromboplastin time (PTT) were the top 22 features of the NN model with 
the greatest impact. Finally, after hyperparameter optimization, SHAP plots were 
employed to make the NN-based model interpretable with an analytical description 
of how the constructed model visualizes the prediction of death.
CONCLUSION: We developed a predictive model to predict the 28-day mortality for 
ICU patients with HF combined with hypertension, which proved superior to the 
traditional logistic regression analysis. The SHAP method enables machine 
learning models to be more interpretable, thereby helping clinicians to better 
understand the reasoning behind the outcome and assess in-hospital outcomes for 
critically ill patients.

BACKGROUND: Triglyceride-glucose (TyG) index as a reliable surrogate of insulin 
resistance (IR) has been shown to be related to adverse clinical outcomes in 
patients with acute coronary syndrome, heart failure, ischemic stroke and so on. 
However, the relationship between TyG index and all-cause mortality in intensive 
care unit (ICU) patients remains unknown. The purpose of this study was to 
investigate the correlation between TyG index and all-cause mortality to 
evaluate the impact of IR on the prognosis of this population.
METHODS: This was a retrospective observational study that included 3026 
patients who had an initial triglyceride and glucose data on the first day of 
ICU admission, and all data were extracted from the Medical Information Mart for 
Intensive Care III (MIMIC-III) database. These patients were grouped into 
quartiles (Q1-Q4) according to TyG index. The Kaplan-Meier analysis was used to 
compare all-cause mortality among the above four groups. Cox proportional 
hazards analyses were performed to examine the association between TyG index and 
all-cause mortality.
RESULTS: During 10.46 years of follow-up, 1148 (37.9%) patients died, of which 
350 (11.6%) occurred during the hospital stay and 258 (8.5%) occurred during the 
ICU stay. Kaplan-Meier analysis showed that the risk of all-cause mortality was 
significantly higher in patients with higher TyG index (log-rank P = 0.021). 
Multivariable Cox proportional hazards analyses showed that the TyG index was an 
independent risk predictor of ICU death (HR: 1.72, 95% CI 1.18-2.52, P = 0.005) 
and hospital death (HR: 2.19, 95% CI 1.59-3.03, P < 0.001), and each 1-unit 
increased in the TyG index, a 1.19-fold increase in the risk of death during the 
hospital stay.
CONCLUSIONS: TyG index is strongly related to the all-cause mortality increasing 
in critically ill patients. This finding indicates that the TyG index might be 
useful in identifying people at high risk of ICU death and hospital death.

OBJECTIVE: The predictors of in-hospital mortality for intensive care units 
(ICUs)-admitted heart failure (HF) patients remain poorly characterised. We 
aimed to develop and validate a prediction model for all-cause in-hospital 
mortality among ICU-admitted HF patients.
DESIGN: A retrospective cohort study.
SETTING AND PARTICIPANTS: Data were extracted from the Medical Information Mart 
for Intensive Care (MIMIC-III) database. Data on 1177 heart failure patients 
were analysed.
METHODS: Patients meeting the inclusion criteria were identified from the 
MIMIC-III database and randomly divided into derivation (n=825, 70%) and a 
validation (n=352, 30%) group. Independent risk factors for in-hospital 
mortality were screened using the extreme gradient boosting (XGBoost) and the 
least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) regression models in the 
derivation sample. Multivariate logistic regression analysis was used to build 
prediction models in derivation group, and then validated in validation cohort. 
Discrimination, calibration and clinical usefulness of the predicting model were 
assessed using the C-index, calibration plot and decision curve analysis. After 
pairwise comparison, the best performing model was chosen to build a nomogram 
according to the regression coefficients.
RESULTS: Among the 1177 admissions, in-hospital mortality was 13.52%. In both 
groups, the XGBoost, LASSO regression and Get With the Guidelines-Heart Failure 
(GWTG-HF) risk score models showed acceptable discrimination. The XGBoost and 
LASSO regression models also showed good calibration. In pairwise comparison, 
the prediction effectiveness was higher with the XGBoost and LASSO regression 
models than with the GWTG-HF risk score model (p<0.05). The XGBoost model was 
chosen as our final model for its more concise and wider net beneﬁt threshold 
probability range and was presented as the nomogram.
CONCLUSIONS: Our nomogram enabled good prediction of in-hospital mortality in 
ICU-admitted HF patients, which may help clinical decision-making for such 
patients.

BACKGROUND: Stroke is a disease characterized by sudden cerebral ischemia and is 
the second leading cause of death worldwide. We aimed to develop and validate a 
nomogram model to predict mortality in intensive care unit patients with stroke.
METHODS: All data involved in this study were extracted from the Medical 
Information Mart for Intensive Care III database (MIMIC-III). The data were 
analyzed using multivariate Cox regression, and the performance of the novel 
nomogram, which assessed the patient's overall survival at 30, 180, and 360 days 
after stroke, was evaluated using Harrell's concordance index (C-index) and the 
area under the receiver operating characteristic curve. A calibration curve and 
decision curve were introduced to test the clinical value and effectiveness of 
our prediction model.
RESULTS: A total of 767 patients with stroke were randomly divided into 
derivation (n = 536) and validation (n = 231) cohorts at a 7:3 ratio. 
Multivariate Cox regression showed that 12 independent predictors, including 
age, weight, ventilation, cardiac arrhythmia, metastatic cancer, explicit 
sepsis, Oxford Acute Severity of Illness Score or OASIS score, diastolic blood 
pressure, bicarbonate, chloride, red blood cell and white blood cell counts, 
played a significant role in the survival of individuals with stroke. The 
nomogram model was validated based on the C-indices, calibration plots, and 
decision curve analysis results.
CONCLUSIONS: The plotted nomogram accurately predicted stroke outcomes and, thus 
may contribute to clinical decision-making and treatment as well as consultation 
services for patients.

PURPOSE: Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) concurrent with 
respiratory failure (RF) is devastating, and may result in death and disability. 
Systemic immune-inflammation index (SII) is a new prognostic biomarker linked to 
unfavorable outcomes of acute coronary syndrome, ischemic stroke, and heart 
failure. Nonetheless, its role in COPD is rarely investigated. Consequently, 
this study intends to assess the accuracy of SII in predicting the prognosis of 
COPD.
PATIENTS AND METHODS: The clinical information was retrospectively acquired from 
the Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care-IV database. The outcomes 
encompassed the incidence of RF and mortality. The relationship between 
different SII and outcomes was examined utilizing the Cox proportional-hazards 
model and restricted cubic splines. Kaplan-Meier analysis was employed for 
all-cause mortality.
RESULTS: The present study incorporated 1653 patients. During hospitalization, 
697 patients (42.2%) developed RF, and 169 patients (10.2%) died. And 637 
patients (38.5%) died during long-term follow-up. Higher SII increased the risk 
of RF (RF: HR: 1.19, 95% CI 1.12-1.28, P<0.001), in-hospital mortality (HR: 
1.22, 95% CI 1.07-1.39, P=0.003), and long-term follow-up mortality (HR: 1.12, 
95% CI 1.05-1.19, P<0.001). Kaplan-Meier analysis suggested a significantly 
elevated risk of all-cause death (log-rank P<0.001) in patients with higher SII, 
especially during the short-term follow-up period of 21 days.
CONCLUSION: SII is closely linked to an elevated risk of RF and death in COPD 
patients. It appears to be a potential predictor of the prognosis of COPD 
patients, which is helpful for the risk stratification of this population. 
However, more prospective studies are warranted to consolidate our conclusion.

BACKGROUND: Triglyceride-glucose (TyG) index, a dependable indicator of insulin 
resistance, has been identified as a valid marker regarding multiple 
cardiovascular diseases. Nevertheless, the correlation of TyG index with acute 
myocardial infarction complicated by cardiogenic shock (AMICS) remains 
uncertain. Our study aims for elucidating this relationship by comprehensively 
analyzing two large-scale cohorts.
METHODS: Utilizing records from the eICU Collaborative Research Database and the 
Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care IV, the link between TyG and the 
incidence and prognosis of AMICS was assessed multicentrally and retrospectively 
by logistic and correlation models, as well as restricted cubic spline (RCS). 
Propensity score matching (PSM), inverse probability of treatment weighting 
(IPTW), and overlap weighting (OW) were employed to balance the potential 
confounders. Subgroup analyses were performed according to potential modifiers.
RESULTS: Overall, 5208 AMI patients, consisting of 375 developing CS were 
finally included. The TyG index exhibited an apparently higher level in AMI 
populations developing CS than in those who did not experienced CS [9.2 
(8.8-9.7) vs. 9.0 (8.5-9.5)], with a moderate discrimination ability to 
recognize AMICS from the general AMI (AUC: 0.604). Logistic analyses showed that 
the TyG index was significantly correlated with in-hospital and ICU mortality. 
RCS analysis demonstrated a linear link between elevated TyG and increased risks 
regarding in-hospital and ICU mortality in the AMICS population. An increased 
mortality risk remains evident in PSM-, OW- and IPTW-adjusted populations with 
higher TyG index who have undergone CS. Correlation analyses demonstrated an 
apparent link between TyG index and APS score. Subgroup analyses presented a 
stable link between elevated TyG and mortality particularly in older age, 
females, those who are overweight or hypertensive, as well as those without 
diabetes.
CONCLUSIONS: Elevated TyG index was related to the incidence of CS following AMI 
and higher mortality risks in the population with AMICS. Our findings pointed a 
previously undisclosed role of TyG index in regard to AMICS that still requires 
further validation.

BACKGROUND: Cardiac arrest (CA) is one of the leading causes of death among 
patients in the intensive care unit (ICU). Although many CA prediction models 
with high sensitivity have been developed to anticipate CA, their practical 
application has been challenging due to a lack of generalization and validation. 
Additionally, the heterogeneity among patients in different ICU subtypes has not 
been adequately addressed.
OBJECTIVE: This study aims to propose a clinically interpretable ensemble 
approach for the timely and accurate prediction of CA within 24 hours, 
regardless of patient heterogeneity, including variations across different 
populations and ICU subtypes. Additionally, we conducted patient-independent 
evaluations to emphasize the model's generalization performance and analyzed 
interpretable results that can be readily adopted by clinicians in real-time.
METHODS: Patients were retrospectively analyzed using data from the Medical 
Information Mart for Intensive Care-IV (MIMIC-IV) and the eICU-Collaborative 
Research Database (eICU-CRD). To address the problem of underperformance, we 
constructed our framework using feature sets based on vital signs, 
multiresolution statistical analysis, and the Gini index, with a 12-hour window 
to capture the unique characteristics of CA. We extracted 3 types of features 
from each database to compare the performance of CA prediction between high-risk 
patient groups from MIMIC-IV and patients without CA from eICU-CRD. After 
feature extraction, we developed a tabular network (TabNet) model using feature 
screening with cost-sensitive learning. To assess real-time CA prediction 
performance, we used 10-fold leave-one-patient-out cross-validation and a 
cross-data set method. We evaluated MIMIC-IV and eICU-CRD across different 
cohort populations and subtypes of ICU within each database. Finally, external 
validation using the eICU-CRD and MIMIC-IV databases was conducted to assess the 
model's generalization ability. The decision mask of the proposed method was 
used to capture the interpretability of the model.
RESULTS: The proposed method outperformed conventional approaches across 
different cohort populations in both MIMIC-IV and eICU-CRD. Additionally, it 
achieved higher accuracy than baseline models for various ICU subtypes within 
both databases. The interpretable prediction results can enhance clinicians' 
understanding of CA prediction by serving as a statistical comparison between 
non-CA and CA groups. Next, we tested the eICU-CRD and MIMIC-IV data sets using 
models trained on MIMIC-IV and eICU-CRD, respectively, to evaluate 
generalization ability. The results demonstrated superior performance compared 
with baseline models.
CONCLUSIONS: Our novel framework for learning unique features provides stable 
predictive power across different ICU environments. Most of the interpretable 
global information reveals statistical differences between CA and non-CA groups, 
demonstrating its utility as an indicator for clinical decisions. Consequently, 
the proposed CA prediction system is a clinically validated algorithm that 
enables clinicians to intervene early based on CA prediction information and can 
be applied to clinical trials in digital health.

OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to evaluate the association between the Endothelial 
Activation and Stress Index (EASIX) and 30-day mortality risk in acute 
myocardial infarction (AMI) patients.
METHODS: Using a retrospective cohort design, data were extracted from the 
Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care-IV (MIMIC-IV) database between 2008 
and 2019. Patients diagnosed with AMI at intensive care unit (ICU) admission 
were included. EASIX score was calculated as follows: lactate dehydrogenase 
(LDH) level (U/L) × creatinine level (mg/dL)/platelet count (109/L). Cox 
regression models assessed the association between EASIX and 30-day mortality, 
with subgroup analyses based on age, gender, AMI subtype, and sepsis status.
RESULTS: A total of 1,036 patients were analyzed, among whom 323 did not survive 
beyond 30 days post-ICU admission. Higher EASIX scores were associated with 
increased 30-day mortality in AMI patients [Hazard ratio (HR): 1.70, 95% 
confidence interval (CI): 1.17-2.46, P = 0.005). Subgroup analyses supported 
these findings and revealed significant interactions between EASIX and variables 
such as gender and AMI subtype (P < 0.05).
CONCLUSION: Elevated EASIX scores are significantly correlated with increased 
30-day mortality risk in AMI patients, suggesting EASIX as a valuable prognostic 
tool that may inform clinical management strategies to improve outcomes in AMI.

BACKGROUND: The triglyceride-glucose (TyG) index has demonstrated correlations 
with adverse clinical outcomes in patients with ischaemic stroke, coronary heart 
disease and cardiac failure. However, its association with overall mortality in 
individuals concurrently experiencing heart failure (HF) and chronic kidney 
disease (CKD) remains inadequately explored.
METHODS: Utilizing the Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care IV (Version 
2.2) repository, subjects underwent quartile stratification based on the TyG 
index. The primary endpoint was all-cause mortality during hospitalization. Cox 
proportional hazard models were employed to examine the correlation between TyG 
and all-cause mortality in HF patients with CKD. Evaluation involved 
Kaplan-Meier (KM) analysis and restricted cubic splines (RCSs) to compare 
mortality rates during hospitalization and 1 year after admission across cohorts 
with varying TyG index levels.
RESULTS: A cohort of 1537 HF and CKD patients participated. Cox regression 
analysis revealed elevated TyG levels as an independent risk factor for both 
in-hospital and 1 year mortality. RCS analysis indicated a rising, non-linear 
association between TyG levels and all-cause mortality (P value for non-linear 
<0.001). KM survival curves demonstrated a statistically significant reduction 
in survival rates within the high TyG index group compared with the low one 
(log-rank P < 0.001).
CONCLUSIONS: The TyG index exhibited substantial independent prognostic value 
for elevated in-hospital and 1 year all-cause mortality among the cohort with HF 
and CKD. These findings suggest that assessing the TyG index could play a 
crucial role in developing novel therapeutic strategies to improve outcomes for 
this high-risk demographic.

BACKGROUND: Heart failure (HF) is a complex disorder that has an association 
with increased morbidity and mortality rates globally. The association of statin 
use with mortality rate in individuals with HF remains unclear.
OBJECTIVES: To examine the association of statin use with the short-term and 
long-term all-cause mortality rate in critically ill individuals with HF.
METHODS: We performed a retrospective cohort analysis based on the Medical 
Information Mart for Intensive Care (MIMIC)-IV database. The critically ill 
people with HF were assigned to a statin group and a non-statin group according 
to whether they had been treated with statin or not during hospitalization. The 
Kaplan-Meier (KM) method and Cox proportional hazard models were adopted to 
explore the link between statin administration and the 30-day, 90-day, as well 
as 1-year mortality rates. To ensure the robustness of the findings, a 1:1 
nearest propensity-score matching (PSM) was also performed.
RESULTS: The current research included 11,381 patients for the final analysis, 
with 7,561 in the statin group and 3,820 in the non-statin group. After multiple 
confounders were adjusted, we found that the Cox regression models revealed 
great beneficial effects of statin therapy on the 30-day, 90-day, as well as 
1-year mortality rates among critically ill individuals with HF in the fully 
adjusted model. PSM also achieved consistent results. After PSM, the risk of 
mortality reduced by 23% for the 30-day mortality (HR = 0.77, 95%CI: 0.68-0.88, 
p < 0.001), 16% for the 90-day mortality rate (HR = 0.84, 95%CI: 0.75-0.93, p < 
0.001), and 12% for the 1-year mortality rate (HR = 0.88, 95%CI: 0.81-0.97, p = 
0.007). Patients treated with rosuvastatin had the greatest reduction in 
mortality rate. The 30-day, 90-day, and 1-year all-cause mortality rates were 
remarkably lower in patients who were treated with low-dose statins.
CONCLUSION: Our study unveiled that statin use was related to decreased 
short-term and long-term all-cause mortality rates in critically ill individuals 
with HF. Rosuvastatin was associated with the greatest reduction of all-cause 
mortality rates. Low-dose statins can significantly reduce short-term and 
long-term mortality, while high-dose statins are not significantly correlated 
with mortality. However, the results are not conclusive and should be 
interpreted with caution.

OBJECTIVE: Coagulopathy score has been applied as a new prognostic indicator for 
sepsis, heart failure and acute respiratory failure. However, its ability to 
forecast intensive care unit (ICU) mortality in patients with an acute cerebral 
hemorrhage (ICH) has not been assessed. The purpose of this study was to clarify 
the relationship between ICU mortality and early coagulation problem score.
METHODS: Data from the Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care (MIMIC-IV) 
(v2.0) database were used in this retrospective cohort analysis. The association 
between the coagulation disorder score and ICU mortality was examined using 
multivariate logistic regression. Furthermore, the impact of additional 
variables on the results was investigated by a subgroup analysis.
RESULTS: 3174 patients (57.3 % male) were enrolled in total. The ICU mortality 
reached 18.2 %. After adjusting for potential confounders, the ICU mortality of 
patients rose with the increase of coagulation disorder score. The ROC curve 
revealed the predictive accuracy of coagulation dysfunction score to mortality 
in patients with ICU. The coagulation disorder score had a lower AUC value 
(0.601, P < 0.001) than the SAPSII(AUCs of 0.745[95 % CI, 0.730-0.761]) and the 
combined indicators(AUCs of 0.752[95 % CI, 0.737-0.767]), but larger than single 
indicators platelet, INR and APTT. In the subgroup analysis, most subgroups 
showed no significant interaction, but only age showed significant interaction 
in the adjusted model.
CONCLUSION: The coagulopathy score and ICU mortality were found to be strongly 
positively correlated in this study, and its ability to predict ICU mortality 
was better than that of a single measure (platelet, INR, or APTT), but worse 
than that of the SAPSII score, GCS system.

INTRODUCTION: Paroxetine is a GRK2 inhibitor that has been widely used to treat 
depression and anxiety over the last few decades. The inhibition of GRK2 has 
been studied extensively in vivo; however, evidence of its impact on heart 
failure remains scarce.
METHODS: To assess the association between paroxetine use and mortality in 
patients with heart failure. We conducted a retrospective longitudinal cohort 
study from 2008 to 2019, with a follow-up time of 28 days for all groups. This 
is a single-center study using the Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care 
IV database with 11,657 heart failure patients identified. We performed genetic 
matching to adjust for the covariates. Heart failure patients prescribed 
paroxetine for >24 h after hospital admission were categorized into the 
paroxetine group (77 patients), with remaining heart failure patients making up 
the matched control group (231 patients). The primary outcome was 28-day 
all-cause mortality from the date of hospital admission. Secondary outcomes 
included length of intensive care unit stay, length of hospital stay, and 
in-hospital mortality. The Kaplan-Meier survival estimator, logistic regression, 
Cox regression, and restricted mean survival time were used to detect the 
association between paroxetine therapy and outcomes.
RESULTS: Patients who received paroxetine during one hospital admission lived, 
on average, 0.7 lesser days (95% CI -2.53 to 1.1, p = 0.46) than patients who 
did not use it in a 28-day truncation time point. Multivariable logistic 
regression, including all matched covariates, demonstrated that the adjusted 
odds ratio of 28-day mortality of the paroxetine administration group was 1.1 
(95% CI 0.37-2.9, p = 0.90). Multivariable Cox regression of 28-day mortality 
presented an adjusted hazard ratio of 1.00 (95% CI 0.42-2.62, p = 0.92). 
Paroxetine was associated with an increased survival time at a 3,000-day 
truncation time point (203 days, 95% CI -305.69 to 817.8, p = 0.37).
CONCLUSIONS: In patients with heart failure, treatment with paroxetine did not 
significantly reduce 28-day all-cause mortality.

Previous studies have suggested that levels of sodium and chloride in the blood 
may be indicative of the prognosis of different medical conditions. 
Nevertheless, the assessment of the prognostic significance of the 
sodium-to-chloride (Na/Cl) ratio in relation to in-hospital mortality among 
individuals suffering from acute heart failure (AHF) remains unexplored. In this 
study, the participants were selected from the Medical Information Mart for 
Intensive Care IV database and divided into three groups based on the Na/Cl 
ratio level upon admission. The primary results were the mortality rate within 
the hospital. Cox regression, Kaplan-Meier curves, receiver operator 
characteristic (ROC) curve analysis and subgroup analyses were utilized to 
investigate the correlation between the admission Na/Cl ratio and outcomes in 
critically ill patients with AHF. A total of 7844 patients who met the selection 
criteria were included in this study. After adjusting for confounders, the 
multivariable Cox regression analysis revealed that the baseline Na/Cl ratio 
significantly elevated the risk of in-hospital mortality among critically ill 
patients with AHF (HR = 1.34, 95% CI 1.21-1.49). Furthermore, when the Na/Cl 
ratio was converted into a categorical factor and the initial tertile was taken 
as a point of comparison, the hazard ratios (HRs) and 95% confidence intervals 
(CIs) for the second and third tertiles were 1.27 (1.05-1.54) and 1.53 
(1.27-1.84), respectively. Additionally, a P value indicating a significant 
trend of < 0.001 was observed. ROC curve analysis showed that Na/Cl ratio had a 
more sensitive prognostic value in predicting in-hospital mortality of AHF than 
the sodium or chloride level alone (0.564 vs. 0.505, 0.544). Subgroup 
examinations indicated that the association between the Na/Cl ratio upon 
admission and the mortality rate of critically ill patients with AHF remained 
consistent in the subgroups of hyponatremia and hypochlorhydria (P for 
interaction > 0.05). The linear relationship between the Na/Cl ratio and 
in-hospital mortality in AHF patients indicates a positive association.

BACKGROUND: Systemic inflammation is closely associated with the development and 
progression of heart failure (HF), increasing vulnerability to thromboembolic 
events. This retrospective cohort study assessed the potential of the 
fibrinogen-to-albumin ratio (FAR), a new inflammatory biomarker, as a prognostic 
indicator for HF risk.
METHODS: One thousand one hundred and sixty six women and 826 men with a mean 
age of 70.70 ± 13.98 years were extracted from the Medical Information Mart for 
Intensive Care-IV (MIMIC-IV v2.0) database. Additionally, a second cohort was 
obtained, including 309 patients from the Second Affiliated Hospital of Wenzhou 
Medical University. The relationship between FAR and the prognosis of HF was 
evaluated using multivariate analysis, propensity score-matched analysis, and 
subgroup analysis.
RESULTS: Fibrinogen-to-albumin ratio was an independent risk factor for 90-day 
all-cause mortality (hazard ratio: 1.19; 95% confidence interval (CI): 
1.01-1.40), 1-year all-cause mortality (hazard ratio: 1.23; 95% confidence 
interval: 1.06-1.41), and length of hospital stay (LOS) (β: 1.52; 95% CI: 
0.67-2.37) in the MIMIC-IV dataset, even after adjusting for potential 
covariates. These findings were verified in the second cohort (β: 1.82; 95% CI: 
0.33-3.31) and persisted after propensity score-matching and subgroup analysis. 
FAR was positively correlated with C-reactive protein, NT-proBNP, and Padua 
score. The correlation between FAR and NT-proBNP (R = .3026) was higher than 
with fibrinogen (R = .2576), albumin (R = -.1822), platelet-to-albumin ratio 
(R = .1170), and platelet-to-lymphocyte ratio (R = .1878) (ps  < .05).
CONCLUSIONS: Fibrinogen-to-albumin ratio is an independent risk prognostic 
factor for 90-day, 1-year all-cause mortality and LOS among HF patients. 
Inflammation and prothrombotic state may underlie the relationship between FAR 
and poor prognosis in HF.

AIMS: This study aims to develop explainable machine learning models and 
clinical tools for predicting mortality in patients in the intensive care unit 
(ICU) with heart failure (HF).
METHODS: Patients diagnosed with HF who experienced their first ICU stay lasting 
between 24 h and 28 days were selected from the Medical Information Mart for 
Intensive Care IV (MIMIC-IV) database. The primary outcome was all-cause 
mortality within 28 days. Data analysis was performed using Python and R, with 
feature selection conducted via least absolute shrinkage and selection operator 
(LASSO) regression. Fifteen models were evaluated, and the most effective model 
was rendered explainable through the Shapley additive explanations (SHAP) 
approach. A nomogram was developed based on logistic regression to facilitate 
interpretation. For external validation, the eICU database was utilized.
RESULTS: After selection, the study included 2343 records, with 1808 surviving 
and 535 deceased patients. The median age of the study population was 70.00, 
with ~3/5 males (60.31%). The median length of stay in the ICU was 6.00 days. 
The median age of the survival group was younger than the non-survival group 
(69.00 vs. 73.00), and non-survival patients spent longer time in the ICU. 
Seventy-five features were initially selected, including basic information, 
vital signs, laboratory tests, haemodynamics and oxygen status. LASSO regression 
determined the shrinkage parameter α = 0.020, and 44 features were chosen for 
model construction. The linear discriminant analysis (LDA) model showed the best 
performance, and the accuracy reached 0.8354 in the training cohort and 0.8563 
in the testing cohort. It showed satisfying area under the curve (AUC), recall, 
precision, F1 score, Cohen's kappa score and Matthew's correlation coefficient. 
The concordance index (c-index) reached 0.7972 in the training cohort and 0.8125 
in the testing cohort. In external validation, the LDA model achieved 
approximately 0.9 in accuracy, precision, recall and F1 score, with an AUC of 
0.79. Univariable analysis was performed in the training cohort. Features that 
differed significantly between the survival and non-survival groups were 
subjected to multiple logistic regression. The nomogram built on multiple 
logistic regression included 14 features and demonstrated excellent performance. 
The AUC of the nomogram is 0.852 in the training cohort, 0.855 in the internal 
validation cohort and 0.770 in the external validation cohort. The calibration 
curve showed good consistency.
CONCLUSIONS: The study developed an LDA and a nomogram model for predicting 
mortality in HF patients in the ICU. The SHAP approach was employed to elucidate 
the LDA model, enhancing its utility for clinicians. These models were made 
accessible online for clinical application.

BACKGROUND: Gastrointestinal bleeding (GIB) is a severe and potentially 
life-threatening complication in patients with acute myocardial infarction 
(AMI), significantly affecting prognosis during hospitalization. Early 
identification of high-risk patients is essential to reduce complications, 
improve outcomes, and guide clinical decision-making.
OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to develop and validate a machine learning 
(ML)-based model for predicting in-hospital GIB in patients with AMI, identify 
key risk factors, and evaluate the clinical applicability of the model for risk 
stratification and decision support.
METHODS: A multicenter retrospective cohort study was conducted, including 1910 
patients with AMI from the Affiliated Hospital of Guangdong Medical University 
(2005-2024). Patients were divided into training (n=1575) and testing (n=335) 
cohorts based on admission dates. For external validation, 1746 patients with 
AMI were included in the publicly available MIMIC-IV (Medical Information Mart 
for Intensive Care IV) database. Propensity score matching was adjusted for 
demographics, and the Boruta algorithm identified key predictors. A total of 7 
ML algorithms-logistic regression, k-nearest neighbors, support vector machine, 
decision tree, random forest (RF), extreme gradient boosting, and neural 
networks-were trained using 10-fold cross-validation. The models were evaluated 
for the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve, accuracy, 
sensitivity, specificity, recall, F1-score, and decision curve analysis. Shapley 
additive explanations analysis ranked variable importance. Kaplan-Meier survival 
analysis evaluated the impact of GIB on short-term survival. Multivariate 
logistic regression assessed the relationship between coronary heart disease 
(CHD) and in-hospital GIB after adjusting for clinical variables.
RESULTS: The RF model outperformed other ML models, achieving an area under the 
receiver operating characteristic curve of 0.77 in the training cohort, 0.77 in 
the testing cohort, and 0.75 in the validation cohort. Key predictors included 
red blood cell count, hemoglobin, maximal myoglobin, hematocrit, CHD, and other 
variables, all of which were strongly associated with GIB risk. Decision curve 
analysis demonstrated the clinical use of the RF model for early risk 
stratification. Kaplan-Meier survival analysis showed no significant differences 
in 7- and 15-day survival rates between patients with AMI with and without GIB 
(P=.83 for 7-day survival and P=.87 for 15-day survival). Multivariate logistic 
regression showed that CHD was an independent risk factor for in-hospital GIB 
(odds ratio 2.79, 95% CI 2.09-3.74). Stratified analyses by sex, age, 
occupation, marital status, and other subgroups consistently showed that the 
association between CHD and GIB remained robust across all subgroups.
CONCLUSIONS: The ML-based RF model provides a robust and clinically applicable 
tool for predicting in-hospital GIB in patients with AMI. By leveraging 
routinely available clinical and laboratory data, the model supports early risk 
stratification and personalized preventive strategies.

BACKGROUND: Lactate was a prognostic indicator for acute myocardial infarction 
(AMI) patients. However, the association between normalized lactate load, 
representing hypoxic burden over time, and in-hospital mortality remained 
uncertain.
METHODS: The data for this study was obtained from the Medical Information Mart 
for Intensive Care IV (MIMIC-IV, version 2.1) database. The normalized lactate 
load, describing the average intensity of hyperlactatemia, was calculated as the 
area under the curve (AUC) of lactate divided by time. 5882 AMI patients 
enrolled in this study were divided into survivor (n = 5015), and non-survivor 
group (n = 867). The primary endpoint was in-hospital mortality. Receiver 
operating characteristic (ROC) curves were generated to assess the predictive 
efficacy of normalized lactate load for in-hospital mortality, and areas under 
the curves of different parameters were compared using DeLong test. Multivariate 
binary logistic regression analysis was employed to explore the association 
between normalized lactate load and in-hospital mortality. The adjusting 
variables included age, gender, ethnicity, heart rate, systolic blood pressure, 
congestive heart failure, shock, dyslipidemia, cardiac arrest, cerebrovascular 
disease, neutrophil, lymphocyte, creatinine, blood nitrogen urea, clopidogrel, 
beta-blockers, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor (ACEI)/angiotensin 
receptor blocker (ARB), statins, dialysis, extracorporeal membrane oxygenation 
(ECMO), the Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (SOFA) score and Simplified 
Acute Physiology Score II (SAPS II). Restricted cubic spline (RCS) was conducted 
to evaluate nonlinear associations of normalized lactate load with in-hospital 
mortality.
RESULTS: The overall in-hospital mortality rate was 14.7%. After adjusting for 
confounding variables, normalized lactate load was independently associated with 
increased risk of in-hospital mortality (Normalized lactate load≥2.6 vs 
Normalized lactate load<2.6: OR, 95% CI: 1.56, 1.27-1.93). The RCS demonstrated 
a positive linear relationship between normalized lactate load and in-hospital 
mortality (non-linear p = 0.725). ROC curves showed that normalized lactate load 
was better than first lactate, maximum lactate, and mean lactate in predicting 
in-hospital mortality, but lower than SOFA and SAPS II. Among participants with 
at least nine lactate measures, normalized lactate load showed predictive 
performance comparable to SOFA and SAPS II.
CONCLUSION: Normalized lactate load can be used to predict the prognosis of 
in-hospital mortality in AMI patients, and its prediction performance increases 
with the increase of lactate measurement.

Acute myocardial infarction (AMI) and sepsis are the leading causes of high 
mortality rates in intensive care units. While sepsis frequently affects the 
cardiovascular system, distinguishing between sepsis-induced cardiomyopathy and 
AMI remains challenging due to overlapping biomarkers. Misdiagnosis can hinder 
timely treatment and increase risk of complications. This study used 
multidimensional clinical data and machine learning techniques to develop and 
validate a novel predictive model for identifying AMI in critically ill patients 
with sepsis. Data from patients with sepsis were extracted from the Medical 
Information Mart for Intensive Care-IV database. Six machine learning algorithms 
were employed for model construction. Additionally, the machine learning-based 
models were compared with traditional scoring systems. Model performance was 
evaluated in terms of discrimination, calibration, and clinical applicability. 
In total, 2,103 critically ill patients with sepsis were included, 459 (21.8%) 
of whom experienced AMI during hospitalization. A total of 26 variables were 
selected for model construction. Among all models, the Gradient Boosting 
Classifier model demonstrated the best predictive performance in terms of 
discrimination, calibration, and clinical applicability. Machine learning models 
have the potential to serve as tools for predicting AMI in patients with sepsis. 
The Gradient Boosting Classifier model developed herein demonstrated promising 
predictive performance, supporting clinicians in identifying patients at 
high-risk of sepsis and implementing early interventions to reduce mortality 
rates.

STUDY OBJECTIVE: The lactate-to-albumin ratio (LAR) has been confirmed to be an 
effective prognostic marker in sepsis, heart failure, and acute respiratory 
failure. However, the relationship between LAR and mortality in patients with 
acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) remains unclear. We aim to evaluate 
the predictive value of LAR for ARDS patients.
DESIGN: A retrospective cohort study.
SETTING: Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care IV (v2.2) database.
PATIENTS: 769 patients with acute respiratory distress syndrome(ARDS).
INTERVENTIONS: We divided the patients into two subgroups according to the 
primary study endpoint (28-days all-cause mortality): the 28-day survivors and 
the 28-day non-survivors.
MEASURES: Multivariate Cox Regression, Receiver Operator Characteristic (ROC) 
and Kaplan-Meier survival analysis were used to investigate the relationship 
between LAR and short-time mortality in patients with ARDS.
MAIN RESULTS: The 28-day mortality was 38 % in this study. Multivariable Cox 
regression analysis showed that LAR was an independent predictive factor for 
28-day mortality (HR 1.11, 95 %CI: 1.06-1.16, P < 0.001). The area under curve 
(AUC) of LAR in the ROC was 70.34 % (95 %CI: 66.53 % - 74.15 %) that provided 
significantly higher discrimination compared with lactate (AUC = 68.00 %, 
P = 0.0007) or albumin (AUC = 63.17 %, P = 0.002) alone. LAR was also not 
inferior to SAPSII with the AUC of 73.44 % (95 %CI: 69.84 % - 77.04 %, 
P = 0.21). Additionally, Kaplan-Meier survival analysis displayed that ARDS 
patients with high LAR (> the cut-off value 0.9055) had a significantly higher 
28-day overall mortality rate (P < 0.001) and in-hospital mortality rate 
(P < 0.001). However, patients in high LAR group had shorter length of hospital 
stay (P < 0.001), which might be caused by higher in-hospital mortality.
CONCLUSIONS: We confirmed that there was a positive correlation between LAR and 
28-day mortality. This could provide anesthesiologists and critical care 
physicians with a more convenient tool than SAPSII without being superior for 
detecting ARDS patients with poor prognosis timely.

AIMS: The effect of changes in serum sodium levels on the survival of patients 
with heart failure (HF) is unclear. We aimed to analyse the impact of serum 
sodium level trajectories on survival in intensive care unit (ICU) patients with 
HF.
METHODS: A total of 4760 patients diagnosed with HF between 2001 and 2012 from 
the Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care III (MIMIC-III) database were 
extracted. Of these patients, 1132 patients who died within 48 h of ICU 
admission were excluded, and 3628 patients were included in this retrospective 
cohort study. Sodium levels were measured at baseline, 6, 12, 18, 24, 30, 36, 
42, and 48 h. Patients were divided into hyponatremia, normal, and hypernatremia 
groups based on baseline sodium levels, and trajectory modelling was performed 
for each group separately. Group-based trajectory model (GBTM) method was 
utilized to identify serum sodium levels trajectories.
RESULTS: The number of patients with hyponatremia (<135 mmol/L), normal sodium 
levels (135-145 mmol/L), and hypernatremia (>145 mmol/L) at baseline were 594 
(16.37%), 2,738 (75.47%), and 296 (8.16%), respectively. A total of seven 
trajectory groups were identified, including hyponatremia-slow rise group 
[initial levels (IL), 128.48 ± 5.42 mmol/L; end levels (EL), 
131.23 ± 3.83 mmol/L], hyponatremia-rapid rise to normal group (IL, 
132.13 ± 2.18 mmol/L; EL, 137.46 ± 3.68 mmol/L), normal-slow decline group (IL, 
137.65 ± 2.15 mmol/L; EL, 134.50 ± 2.54 mmol/L), normal-steady-state group (IL, 
139.20 ± 2.26 mmol/L; EL, 139.04 ± 2.58 mmol/L), normal-slow rise group (IL, 
140.94 ± 2.37 mmol/L; EL, 143.43 ± 2.89 mmol/L), hypernatremia-rapid decline to 
normal group (IL, 146.31 ± 1.98 mmol/L; EL, 140.71 ± 3.61 mmol/L), and 
hypernatremia-slow decline group (IL, 148.89 ± 5.54 mmol/L; EL, 
146.28 ± 3.90 mmol/L). The results showed that hyponatremia-slow rise group 
[hazard ratio (HR) = 1.35; 95% confidence interval (CI), 1.01-1.80, P = 0.040], 
hyponatremia-rapid rise to normal group (HR = 1.37; 95% CI, 1.11-1.71, 
P = 0.004), hypernatremia-rapid decline to normal group (HR = 1.46; 95% CI, 
1.08-1.97, P = 0.014), and hypernatremia-slow decline group (HR = 1.49; 95% CI, 
1.07-2.07, P = 0.018) trajectories were associated with an increased risk of 
1-year mortality in HF patients compared with normal-steady-state group. After 
adjustment for all confounders, hyponatremia-rapid rise to normal group 
(HR = 1.26, 95% CI; 1.01-1.57, P = 0.038) and hypernatremia-rapid decline to 
normal group (HR = 1.36; 95% CI, 1.01-1.84, P = 0.047) trajectories were still 
related to an increased risk of 1-year mortality in patients with HF.
CONCLUSIONS: Serum sodium level trajectories were associated with mortality in 
patients with HF. Association between serum sodium level trajectories and 
prognosis in patients with HF deserve further study.

BACKGROUND: Stress hyperglycemia ratio (SHR) has shown a predominant correlation 
with transient adverse events in critically ill patients. However, there remains 
a gap in comprehensive research regarding the association between SHR and 
mortality among patients experiencing cardiac arrest and admitted to the 
intensive care unit (ICU).
METHODS: A total of 535 patients with their initial ICU admission suffered 
cardiac arrest, according to the American Medical Information Mart for Intensive 
Care (MIMIC)-IV database. Patients were stratified into four categories based on 
quantiles of SHR. Multivariable Cox regression models were used to evaluate the 
association SHR and mortality. The association between SHR and mortality was 
assessed using multivariable Cox regression models. Subgroup analyses were 
conducted to determine whether SHR influenced ICU, 1-year, and long-term 
all-cause mortality in subgroups stratified according to diabetes status.
RESULTS: Patients with higher SHR, when compared to the reference quartile 1 
group, exhibited a greater risk of ICU mortality (adjusted hazard ratio [aHR] = 
3.029; 95% CI: 1.802-5.090), 1-year mortality (aHR = 3.057; 95% CI: 
1.885-4.958), and long-term mortality (aHR = 3.183; 95% CI: 2.020-5.015). This 
association was particularly noteworthy among patients without diabetes, as 
indicated by subgroup analysis.
CONCLUSION: Elevated SHR was notably associated with heightened risks of ICU, 
1-year, and long-term all-cause mortality among cardiac arrest patients. These 
findings underscore the importance of considering SHR as a potential prognostic 
factor in the critical care management of cardiac arrest patients, warranting 
further investigation and clinical attention.

BACKGROUND: There is a continual push for developing accurate predictors for 
Intensive Care Unit (ICU) admitted heart failure (HF) patients and in-hospital 
mortality.
OBJECTIVE: The study aimed to utilize transparent machine learning and create 
hierarchical clustering of key predictors based off of model importance 
statistics gain, cover, and frequency.
METHODS: Inclusion criteria of complete patient information for in-hospital 
mortality in the ICU with HF from the MIMIC-III database were randomly divided 
into a training (n = 941, 80%) and test (n = 235, 20%). A grid search was set to 
find hyperparameters. Machine Learning with XGBoost were used to predict 
mortality followed by feature importance with Shapely Additive Explanations 
(SHAP) and hierarchical clustering of model metrics with a dendrogram and heat 
map.
RESULTS: Of the 1,176 heart failure ICU patients that met inclusion criteria for 
the study, 558 (47.5%) were males. The mean age was 74.05 (SD = 12.85). XGBoost 
model had an area under the receiver operator curve of 0.662. The highest 
overall SHAP explanations were urine output, leukocytes, bicarbonate, and 
platelets. Average urine output was 1899.28 (SD = 1272.36) mL/day with the 
hospital mortality group having 1345.97 (SD = 1136.58) mL/day and the group 
without hospital mortality having 1986.91 (SD = 1271.16) mL/day. The average 
leukocyte count in the cohort was 10.72 (SD = 5.23) cells per microliter. For 
the hospital mortality group the leukocyte count was 13.47 (SD = 7.42) cells per 
microliter and for the group without hospital mortality the leukocyte count was 
10.28 (SD = 4.66) cells per microliter. The average bicarbonate value was 26.91 
(SD = 5.17) mEq/L. Amongst the group with hospital mortality the average 
bicarbonate value was 24.00 (SD = 5.42) mEq/L. Amongst the group without 
hospital mortality the average bicarbonate value was 27.37 (SD = 4.98) mEq/L. 
The average platelet value was 241.52 platelets per microliter. For the group 
with hospital mortality the average platelet value was 216.21 platelets per 
microliter. For the group without hospital mortality the average platelet value 
was 245.47 platelets per microliter. Cluster 1 of the dendrogram grouped the 
temperature, platelets, urine output, Saturation of partial pressure of Oxygen 
(SPO2), Leukocyte count, lymphocyte count, bicarbonate, anion gap, respiratory 
rate, PCO2, BMI, and age as most similar in having the highest aggregate gain, 
cover, and frequency metrics.
CONCLUSION: Machine Learning models that incorporate dendrograms and heat maps 
can offer additional summaries of model statistics in differentiating factors 
between in patient ICU mortality in heart failure patients.

BACKGROUND: Intensive Care Unit (ICU) readmissions in patients with heart 
failure (HF) result in a significant risk of death and financial burden for 
patients and healthcare systems. Prediction of at-risk patients for readmission 
allows for targeted interventions that reduce morbidity and mortality.
METHODS AND RESULTS: We presented a process mining/deep learning approach for 
the prediction of unplanned 30-day readmission of ICU patients with HF. A 
patient's health records can be understood as a sequence of observations called 
event logs; used to discover a process model. Time information was extracted 
using the DREAM (Decay Replay Mining) algorithm. Demographic information and 
severity scores upon admission were then combined with the time information and 
fed to a neural network (NN) model to further enhance the prediction efficiency. 
Additionally, several machine learning (ML) algorithms were developed to be used 
as the baseline models for the comparison of the results.
RESULTS: By using the Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care III 
(MIMIC-III) dataset of 3411 ICU patients with HF, our proposed model yielded an 
area under the receiver operating characteristics (AUROC) of 0.930, 95% 
confidence interval of [0.898-0.960], the precision of 0.886, sensitivity of 
0.805, accuracy of 0.841, and F-score of 0.800 which were far better than the 
results of the best baseline model and the existing literature.
CONCLUSIONS: The proposed approach was capable of modeling the time-related 
variables and incorporating the medical history of patients from prior hospital 
visits for prediction. Thus, our approach significantly improved the outcome 
prediction compared to that of other ML-based models and health calculators.

OBJECTIVE: This cohort study was to assess the association between serum calcium 
levels and the risk of acute kidney injury (AKI) in acute myocardial infarction 
(AMI) patients.
METHODS: This study was analyzed using data of 1286 AMI patients aged ≥18 years 
who stayed in ICU more than 24 h in Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care 
IV (MIMIC-IV) database. Univariable logistic regression model was established to 
identify potential covariates. Univariate and multivariable logistic regression 
models were used to analyze the association between serum calcium and the risk 
of AKI in patients with AMI. The association between serum calcium and the risk 
of AKI in patients with AMI was also shown by restricted cubic spline (RCS) 
plot. Odds ratio (OR) and 95% confidence interval (CI) were calculated.
RESULTS: The median follow-up time was 1.61 (1.23, 2.30) days, and 436 (33.90%) 
participants had AKI at the end of follow-up. After adjusting for covariates, 
elevated level of serum calcium level was related to reduced risk of AKI in AMI 
patients (OR = 0.88, 95%CI: 0.80-0.98). Decreased risk of AKI was found in AMI 
patients with serum calcium level of 8.40-8.90 mg/dL (OR = 0.54, 95%CI: 
0.34-0.86) or ≥8.90 mg/dL (OR = 0.60, 95%CI: 0.37-0.99). The RCS plot depicted 
that serum calcium level was negatively correlated with the risk of AKI in 
patients with AMI.
CONCLUSIONS: AMI patients with AKI had lower serum calcium levels compared with 
those without AKI. Increased serum calcium level was associated with decreased 
risk of AKI in patients with AMI.

BACKGROUND: Acute kidney injury (AKI) in patients with acute myocardial 
infarction (AMI) often indicates a poor prognosis.
OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to investigate the association between the TyG index 
and the risk of AKI in patients with AMI.
METHODS: Data were taken from the Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care 
(MIMIC) database. A 1:3 propensity score (PS) was set to match patients in the 
AKI and non-AKI groups. Multivariate logistic regression analysis, restricted 
cubic spline (RCS) regression and subgroup analysis were performed to assess the 
association between TyG index and AKI.
RESULTS: Totally, 1831 AMI patients were included, of which 302 (15.6%) had AKI. 
The TyG level was higher in AKI patients than in non-AKI patients 
(9.30 ± 0.71 mg/mL vs. 9.03 ± 0.73 mg/mL, P < 0.001). Compared to the lowest 
quartile of TyG levels, quartiles 3 or 4 had a higher risk of AKI, respectively 
(Odds Ratiomodel 4 = 2.139, 95% Confidence Interval: 1.382-3.310, for quartile 4 
vs. quartile 1, Ptrend < 0.001). The risk of AKI increased by 34.4% when the TyG 
level increased by 1 S.D. (OR: 1.344, 95% CI: 1.150-1.570, P < 0.001). The TyG 
level was non-linearly associated with the risk of AKI in the population within 
a specified range. After 1:3 propensity score matching, the results were similar 
and the TyG level remained a risk factor for AKI in patients with AMI.
CONCLUSION: High levels of TyG increase the risk of AKI in AMI patients. The TyG 
level is a predictor of AKI risk in AMI patients, and can be used for clinical 
management.

BACKGROUND: The coexistence of heart failure and diabetes is prevalent, 
particularly in Intensive Care Units (ICU). However, the relationship between 
the triglyceride-glucose (TyG) index, heart failure, diabetes, and the length of 
hospital stay (LHS) in patients with cerebrovascular disease in the ICU remains 
uncertain. This study aims to investigate the association between the TyG index 
and LHS in patients with heart failure and diabetes.
METHODS: This retrospective study utilized the Medical Information Mart for 
Intensive Care (MIMIC)-IV database to analyze patients with diabetes and heart 
failure. Participants were categorized into quartiles based on the TyG index, 
and the primary outcome was LHS. The association between the TyG index at ICU 
admission and LHS was examined through multivariable logistic regression models, 
restricted cubic spline regression, and subgroup analysis.
RESULTS: The study included 635 patients with concurrent diabetes and heart 
failure. The fully adjusted model demonstrated a positive association between 
the TyG index and LHS. As a tertile variable (Q2 and Q3 vs Q1), the beta (β) 
values were 0.88 and 2.04, with a 95% confidence interval (95%CI) of -0.68 to 
2.44 and 0.33 to 3.74, respectively. As a continuous variable, per 1 unit 
increment, the β (95% CI) was 1.13 (0.18 to 2.08). The TyG index's relationship 
with LHS showed linearity (non-linear p = 0.751). Stratified analyses further 
confirmed the robustness of this correlation.
CONCLUSION: The TyG index exhibited a linearly positive association with the LHS 
in patients with both heart failure and diabetes. Nevertheless, prospective, 
randomized, controlled studies are imperative to substantiate and validate the 
findings presented in this investigation.

BACKGROUND: Fluid resuscitation is necessary to correct the sepsis-induced 
hypoperfusion, which is contradictory to the treatment of heart failure. This 
study explored the association between fluid balance (FB) of the first 24 h 
after ICU admission and mortality in critically ill patients with heart failure 
and sepsis.
METHODS: Data were extracted from the Medical Information Mart for Intensive 
Care database. The locally weighted scatterplot smoothing (Lowess) method was 
used to demonstrate the relationship between FB and in-hospital mortality. 
Groups were divided into high FB (≥ 55.85 ml/kg) and low FB (< 55.85 ml/kg) 
according to the cut-off value of FB using Receiver operating characteristic 
analysis and Youden index method. The primary outcome was in-hospital mortality. 
Subgroup analyses, multivariable logistic regression analyses, and Kaplan-Meier 
curves were used to detect the association and survival difference between 
groups. Inverse probability treatment weighting (IPTW) and propensity score 
matching (PSM) were performed to minimize the bias of confounding factors and 
facilitate the comparability between groups.
RESULTS: A total of 936 patients were included. The Lowess curve showed an 
approximate positive linear relationship for FB and in-hospital mortality. In 
the multivariable logistic regression adjusted model, high FB showed strong 
associations with in-hospital mortality (OR 2.53, 95% CI 1.60-3.99, p < 0.001) 
as compared to the low FB group. In IPTW and PSM models, high FB consistently 
showed higher in-hospital mortality (IPTW model: OR 1.94, 95% CI 1.52-2.49, 
p < 0.001; PSM model: OR 2.93, 95% CI 1.75-4.90, p < 0.001) and 30-day mortality 
(IPTW model: OR 1.65, 95% CI 1.29-2.10, p < 0.001; PSM model: OR 2.50, 95% CI 
1.51-4.15, p < 0.001), compared with the low FB group.
CONCLUSION: For critically ill patients with heart failure and sepsis, high FB 
within the first 24 h after ICU admission could serve as an independent risk 
factor for in-hospital mortality and 30-day mortality. The avoidance of fluid 
overload exerts important effects on reducing mortality in such patients.

It has been demonstrated that lactate/albumin (L/A) ratio is substantially 
relevant to the prognosis of sepsis, septic shock, and heart failure. However, 
there is still debate regarding the connection between the L/A ratio and severe 
acute myocardial infarction (AMI). The aim of this study is to determine the 
prognostic role of L/A ratio in patients with severe AMI. Our retrospective 
study extracted data from the Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care III 
(MIMIC-III) database, included 1,134 patients diagnosed with AMI. Based on the 
tertiles of L/A ratio, the patients were divided into three groups: Tertile1 
(T1) group (L/A ratio<0.4063, n=379), Tertile2 (T2) group (0.4063≤L/A 
ratio≤0.6667, n =379), and Tertile3 (T3) group (L/A ratio>0.6667, n =376). Uni- 
and multivariate COX regression model were used to analyze the relationship 
between L/A ratio and 14-day, 28-day and 90-day all-cause mortality. Meanwhile, 
the restricted cubic spline (RCS) model was used to evaluate the effect of L/A 
ratio as a continuous variable. Higher mortality was observed in AMI patients 
with higher L/A ratio. Multivariate Cox proportional risk model validated the 
independent association of L/A ratio with 14-day all-cause mortality [hazard 
ratio (HR) 1.813, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.041-3.156 (T3 vs T1 group)], 
28-day all-cause mortality [HR 1.725, 95% CI 1.035-2.874 (T2 vs T1 group), HR 
1.991, 95% CI 1.214-3.266 (T3 vs T1 group)], as well as 90-day all-cause 
mortality [HR 1.934, 95% CI 1.176-3.183 (T2 vs T1 group), HR 2.307, 95% CI 
1.426-3.733 (T3 vs T1 group)]. There was a consistent trend in subgroup 
analysis. The Kaplan-Meier (K-M) survival curves indicated that patients with 
L/A ratio>0.6667 had the highest mortality. Even after adjusting the confounding 
factors, RCS curves revealed a nearly linearity between L/A ratio and 14-day, 
28-day and 90-day all-cause mortality. Meanwhile, the areas under the receiver 
operating characteristic (ROC) curve (AUC) of 14-day, 28-day and 90-day 
all-cause mortality were 0.730, 0.725 and 0.730, respectively. L/A ratio was 
significantly associated with 14-day, 28-day and 90-day all-cause mortality in 
critical patients with AMI. Higher L/A ratio will be considered an independent 
risk factor for higher mortality in AMI patients.

BACKGROUND: Insulin resistance (IR) is closely related to the development of 
cardiovascular diseases. Triglyceride-glucose-body mass index (TyG-BMI) has been 
proven to be a reliable surrogate of IR, but the relationship between TyG-BMI 
and acute myocardial infarction (AMI) is unknown. The present study aims to 
determine the effects of TyG-BMI on the clinical prognosis of critically ill 
patients with AMI.
METHODS: The data of AMI patients were extracted from the Medical Information 
Mart for Intensive Care IV (MIMIC-IV) database. All patients were divided into 
four groups according to the TyG-BMI quartile. Outcomes were defined as 30-, 
90-, 180-, and 365-day all-cause mortality. Kaplan-Meier (K-M) curve was used to 
compare survival rate between groups. Meanwhile, Cox regression analysis and 
restricted cubic splines (RCS) were used to explore the relationship between 
TyG-BMI index and outcome events.
RESULTS: A total of 1,188 critically ill patients with AMI were included in this 
study. They were divided into four groups according to TyG-BMI quartiles, there 
were significant differences in 90-, 180-, and 365-day all-cause mortality while 
there was no difference in 30-day all-cause mortality. Interestingly, with the 
increase of TyG-BMI, the 90-, 180-, and 365-day survival rate increased first 
and then gradually decreased, but the survival rate after decreasing was still 
higher than that in the group with the lowest TyG-BMI. U-shaped relationships 
between TyG-BMI index and 90-, 180-, and 365-day all-cause mortality were 
identified using RCS curve and the inflection point was 311.1, 316.5, and 320.1, 
respectively, whereas the TyG-BMI index was not non-linearly associated with 
30-day all-cause mortality. The results of Cox proportional hazard regression 
analysis are consistent with those of RCS analysis.
CONCLUSION: U-shaped relationships are existed between the TyG-BMI index and 
90-, 180-, and 365-day all-cause mortality in critically ill patients with AMI, 
but not 30-day all-cause mortality. The TyG-BMI index can be used as an 
effective index for early prevention of critically ill patients with AMI.

BACKGROUND: The Geriatric Nutritional Risk Index (GNRI) is a clinical indicator 
for evaluating the nutritional status of patients, but its role in the 
short-term prognosis of patients with acute myocardial infarction is still not 
fully understood. This study aims to explore the correlation between the GNRI 
and the overall mortality within 30 days and 365 days in those with acute 
myocardial infarction (AMI).
METHODS: A retrospective analysis was performed utilizing the Medical 
Information Mart for Intensive Care IV (MIMIC-IV) database. The study included 
895 patients diagnosed with AMI and identified through ICD9 and ICD10 codes 
(410, I21, I23) who were hospitalized for the first time due to AMI. Subjects 
were classified into four groups according to GNRI: high (GNRI <82, n = 110), 
moderate (82 ≤ GNRI <92, n = 205), low (92 ≤ GNRI <98, n = 225), and no 
nutritional risk (GNRI ≥98, n = 355). Restricted cubic splines (RCS) and 
threshold effect analyses were applied to explore the non-linear relationship 
between GNRI and mortality. Subgroup analyses were conducted based on gender, 
hypertension, diabetes, stroke, hyperlipidemia, chronic obstructive pulmonary 
disease, and age. A mediation study was conducted to investigate the impact of 
lymphocytes on the association between GNRI and mortality.
RESULTS: In an overall sample of 895 patients, an elevated GNRI correlated with 
reduced 30-day (HR = 0.937, 95% CI: 0.917-0.957, p < 0.001) and 365-day 
mortality (HR = 0.937, 95% CI: 0.923-0.950, p < 0.001). The trend analysis for 
GNRI categories indicated a significant decline in mortality associated with 
rising GNRI (P for trend <0.001). Subgroup analysis validated the consistency of 
such results throughout diverse patient characteristics. The lymphocytes 
significantly mediated the relationship between GNRI and 30-day mortality (ACME: 
0.022, 95% CI: 0.003-0.180, p < 0.001). A landmark analysis at 20 days after 
admission further demonstrated the impact of GNRI on mortality during different 
phases of recovery.
CONCLUSION: This study highlights the prognostic value of GNRI in predicting 
short-term and long-term mortality in AMI patients, emphasizing the significance 
of nutritional status and inflammatory indicators in the therapy and risk 
assessment of these individuals.

Background: Whether heart rate (HR) fluctuation after admission has an impact on 
the outcomes of critically ill myocardial infarction (MI) patients in intensive 
care unit remains unknown. Methods: A total of 2,031 MI patients were enrolled 
from the Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care (MIMIC-III) database. HR 
fluctuation was calculated as the maximum HR minus the minimum HR in the initial 
24 h after admission. Participants were divided into 3 groups, namely, low HR 
fluctuation [<30 beats per minute (bpm)], medium HR fluctuation (30-49 bpm), and 
high HR fluctuation (≥ 50 bpm). The main outcomes were 30-day and 1-year 
mortality. Cox regression and restricted cubic spline model were used. Results: 
Each 10-bpm increase in HR fluctuation was associated with a higher risk of 
30-day mortality and 1-year mortality, with adjusted hazard ratios of 1.122 (95% 
CI, 1.083-1.162) and 1.107 (95% CI, 1.074-1.140), respectively. Compared with 
the low HR fluctuation group, the high HR fluctuation group suffered a 
significantly higher risk of mortality after adjustment, with hazard ratios of 
2.156 (95% CI, 1.483-3.134) for 30-day mortality and 1.796 (95% CI, 1.354-2.381) 
for 1-year mortality. A typical J-type curve was observed in restricted cubic 
splines for the association between HR fluctuation and 30-day or 1-year 
mortality of MI patients, with the lowest risk on the HR fluctuation of 30 bpm. 
Sensitivity analyses emphasized the robustness of our results. Conclusions: This 
retrospective cohort study revealed an independent positive association between 
HR fluctuation and 30-day and 1-year mortality in critically ill MI patients, 
which warrants further investigation.

OBJECTIVE: Hypoproteinemia is common in patients with acute heart failure, 
especially in the intensive care unit (ICU). We assessed short-term mortality in 
patients with acute heart failure for albumin and nonalbumin users.
METHODS: Our study was a retrospective, observational and single-center study. 
We included patients with acute heart failure from the Medical Information Mart 
for Intensive Care-IV and compared short-term mortality and length of hospital 
stay in patients with and without albumin use. We used propensity score matching 
(PSM) to adjust for confounders, a multivariate Cox proportional hazard 
regression model, and performed subgroup analysis.
RESULTS: We enrolled 1706 patients with acute heart failure (318 albumin users 
and 1388 nonalbumin users). The 30-day overall mortality rate was 15.1% 
(258/1706). After PSM, the 30-day overall mortality was 22.9% (67/292) in the 
nonalbumin group and 13.7% (40/292) in the albumin group. In the Cox regression 
model, after propensity matching, the albumin use group was associated with a 
47% reduction in 30-day overall mortality [hazard ratio (HR) = 0.53, 95% 
confidence interval (CI): 0.36-0.78, P = 0.001]. In subgroup analysis, the 
association was more significant in males, patients with heart failure with 
reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF), and nonsepsis patients.
CONCLUSION: In conclusion, our investigation suggests that the use of albumin 
was associated with lower 30-day mortality in patients with acute heart failure, 
especially in males, those aged >75 years, those with HFrEF, those with higher 
N-terminal pro-brain natriuretic peptide levels, and those without sepsis.

BACKGROUND: Cardiac arrest (CA) is one of the leading causes of death globally, 
characterized by high incidence and mortality. It is of particular significance 
to determine the prognosis of patients with CA early and accurately. Therefore, 
we aim to investigate the correlation between albumin-corrected calcium (ACC) 
and the prognosis in patients diagnosed with CA.
METHODS: We retrospectively collected data from medical information mart for 
intensive care IV database. Patients were divided into two groups (survival and 
non-survival groups), according to the 90-day prognosis. In the Restricted cubic 
spline (RCS) analysis, the cut-off values (8.86 and 10.32) were obtained to 
categorize patients into three groups: low ACC group (< 8.86), moderate ACC 
group (8.86-10.32), and high ACC group (> 10.32). The least absolute shrinkage 
and selection operator with a ten-fold cross-validation regression analysis was 
performed to identify variables linked to the mortality. The inverse probability 
treatment weighting (IPTW) was used to address the confounding factors, and a 
weighted cohort was generated. RCS, Kaplan-Meier curve, and Cox regression 
analyses were used to explore the relationship between ACC and the mortality. 
Sensitivity analysis was employed to validate the stability of the results.
RESULTS: Cut-off values for ACC of 8.86 and 10.32 were determined. RCS analyses 
showed that there was an overall non-linear trend relationship between ACC and 
the risk of 90-day and 360-day mortalities. After IPTW adjustment, compared to 
the moderate ACC group, the 90-day and 360-day mortalities in the high ACC group 
were higher (P < 0.05). The Cox analyses before and after IPTW adjustment showed 
that both low ACC and high ACC group were independent risk factors for 90-day 
and 360-day all-cause mortality in patients with CA (P < 0.05). The results 
obtained from sensitivity analyses indicated the stability of the findings. The 
Kaplan-Meier survival curves indicated that 90- and 360-day cumulative survival 
rates in the low ACC and high ACC groups were lower than that in the moderate 
ACC group (χ2 = 11.350, P = 0.003; χ2 = 14.110, P = 0.001).
CONCLUSION: Both low ACC (< 8.86) and high ACC groups (> 10.32) were independent 
risk factors for 90-day and 360-day all-cause mortality in patients with CA 
(P < 0.05). For those CA patients with high and low ACC, it deserved the 
attention of clinicians.

BACKGROUND: Clinical notes contain contextualized information beyond structured 
data related to patients' past and current health status.
OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to design a multimodal deep learning approach to 
improve the evaluation precision of hospital outcomes for heart failure (HF) 
using admission clinical notes and easily collected tabular data.
METHODS: Data for the development and validation of the multimodal model were 
retrospectively derived from 3 open-access US databases, including the Medical 
Information Mart for Intensive Care III v1.4 (MIMIC-III) and MIMIC-IV v1.0, 
collected from a teaching hospital from 2001 to 2019, and the eICU Collaborative 
Research Database v1.2, collected from 208 hospitals from 2014 to 2015. The 
study cohorts consisted of all patients with critical HF. The clinical notes, 
including chief complaint, history of present illness, physical examination, 
medical history, and admission medication, as well as clinical variables 
recorded in electronic health records, were analyzed. We developed a deep 
learning mortality prediction model for in-hospital patients, which underwent 
complete internal, prospective, and external evaluation. The Integrated 
Gradients and SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) methods were used to analyze 
the importance of risk factors.
RESULTS: The study included 9989 (16.4%) patients in the development set, 2497 
(14.1%) patients in the internal validation set, 1896 (18.3%) in the prospective 
validation set, and 7432 (15%) patients in the external validation set. The area 
under the receiver operating characteristic curve of the models was 0.838 (95% 
CI 0.827-0.851), 0.849 (95% CI 0.841-0.856), and 0.767 (95% CI 0.762-0.772), for 
the internal, prospective, and external validation sets, respectively. The area 
under the receiver operating characteristic curve of the multimodal model 
outperformed that of the unimodal models in all test sets, and tabular data 
contributed to higher discrimination. The medical history and physical 
examination were more useful than other factors in early assessments.
CONCLUSIONS: The multimodal deep learning model for combining admission notes 
and clinical tabular data showed promising efficacy as a potentially novel 
method in evaluating the risk of mortality in patients with HF, providing more 
accurate and timely decision support.

BACKGROUND: The frailty index based on laboratory tests (FI-lab) can identify 
individuals at increased risk for adverse health outcomes. The association 
between the FI-lab and all-cause mortality in patients with heart failure (HF) 
in the intensive care unit (ICU) remains unknown. This study aimed to determine 
the correlation between FI-lab and all-cause mortality to evaluate the impact of 
FI-lab on the prognosis of critically ill patients with HF.
METHODS: This retrospective observational study utilized data extracted from the 
Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care IV database. The FI-lab, which 
consists of 33 laboratory tests, was constructed. Patients were then grouped 
into quartiles (Q1-Q4) based on their FI-lab scores. Kaplan-Meier analysis was 
used to compare all-cause mortality among the four groups. A Cox proportional 
hazard analysis was conducted to examine the association between the FI-lab 
score and all-cause mortality. The incremental predictive value of adding FI-lab 
to classical disease severity scores was assessed using Harrell's C statistic, 
integrated discrimination improvement (IDI) and net reclassification improvement 
(NRI).
RESULTS: Among 3021 patients, 838 (27.74%) died within 28 days, and 1400 
(46.34%) died within a 360 day follow-up period. Kaplan-Meier analysis indicated 
that patients with higher FI-lab scores had significantly higher risks of 
all-cause mortality (log-rank P < 0.001). Multivariable Cox regression suggested 
that FI-lab, evaluated as a continuous variable (for each 0.01 increase), was 
associated with increased 28 day mortality [hazard ratio (HR) 1.02, 95% 
confidence interval (CI) (1.01-1.03), P < 0.001] and 360 day mortality [HR 1.02, 
95% CI (1.01-1.02), P < 0.001]. When assessed in quartiles, the 28 day mortality 
risk [HR 1.66, 95% CI (1.28-2.15), P < 0.001] and 360 day mortality risk [HR 
1.48, 95% CI (1.23-1.8), P < 0.001] were significantly higher for FI-lab Q4 
compared with FI-lab Q1. FI-lab significantly improved the predictive capability 
of classical disease severity scores for 28 and 360 day mortality.
CONCLUSIONS: In ICU patients diagnosed with HF, the FI-lab is a potent predictor 
of short-term and long-term mortality in critically ill patients with HF. The 
active use of FI-lab to identify high-risk groups among critically ill HF 
patients and initiate timely interventions may have significant value in 
improving the prognosis of critically ill patients with HF.

BACKGROUND: The relationship between triglyceride glucose (TyG) index and the 
incidence of acute kidney injury (AKI) in patients with acute myocardial 
infarction (AMI) is unclear. This study aims to explore the relationship between 
the two.
METHODS: Participants were enrolled from Medical Information Mart for Intensive 
Care IV (MIMICIV) and grouping of subjects based on the quartile interval of the 
TyG index. With the presence of AKI as the main outcome, a logistic regression 
model was constructed. The correlation of the TyG index with the results 
obtained was examined by using a restricted cubic spline (RCS) model.

Publisher: UVOD: Veza između indeksa triglicerida glukoze (TiG) i incidence 
akutne povrede bubrega (AKI) kod pacijenata sa akutnim infarktom miokarda (AMI) 
nije jasna. Ova studija ima za cilj da istraži odnos između njih.
METODE: Učesnici su upisani iz Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care IV 
(MIMICIV) i grupisanje ispitanika na osnovu kvartilnog intervala TiG indeksa. Uz 
prisustvo AKI kao glavnog ishoda, konstruisan je model logističke regresije. 
Korelacija TiG indeksa sa dobijenim rezultatima ispitana je korišćenjem modela 
ograničenog kubnog splajna (RCS).
REZULTATI: Među 1.101 učesnikom AMI, 64,7% su bili muški pacijenti, a ukupna 
stopa incidencije AKI je bila 37,1%. Rezultati multivarijantne logističke 
regresione analize (LRA) otkrili su nezavisnu korelaciju TiG indeksa sa 
povećanim rizikom od AKI (odnos šanse (OR) = 2,23; interval poverenja (CI) = 
1,59 do 3,17; P < 0,001). K4 (9,5-12,208) u kvartilu TiG indeksa je nezavisno 
korelirao sa povećanim rizikom od AKI (OR = 2,99, 95% CI = 1,64 do 5,46, P < 
0,001). RCS model je pokazao da se rizik od AKI linearno povećavao sa povećanjem 
TiG indeksa (P=0,313).
ZAKLJUČAK: Kod pacijenata sa AMI, incidencija TiG i AKI je usko povezana. Ipak, 
potrebne su dalje studije kako bi se potvrdio nalaz.

BACKGROUND: The lack of automated tools for measuring care quality limits the 
implementation of a national program to assess guideline-directed care in heart 
failure with reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF).
OBJECTIVES: The authors aimed to automate the identification of patients with 
HFrEF at hospital discharge, an opportunity to evaluate and improve the quality 
of care.
METHODS: The authors developed a novel deep-learning language model for 
identifying patients with HFrEF from discharge summaries of hospitalizations 
with heart failure at Yale New Haven Hospital during 2015 to 2019. HFrEF was 
defined by left ventricular ejection fraction <40% on antecedent 
echocardiography. The authors externally validated the model at Northwestern 
Medicine, community hospitals of Yale, and the MIMIC-III (Medical Information 
Mart for Intensive Care III) database.
RESULTS: A total of 13,251 notes from 5,392 unique individuals (age 73 ± 14 
years, 48% women), including 2,487 patients with HFrEF (46.1%), were used for 
model development (train/held-out: 70%/30%). The model achieved an area under 
receiver-operating characteristic curve (AUROC) of 0.97 and area under precision 
recall curve (AUPRC) of 0.97 in detecting HFrEF on the held-out set. The model 
had high performance in identifying HFrEF with AUROC = 0.94 and AUPRC = 0.91 on 
19,242 notes from Northwestern Medicine, AUROC = 0.95 and AUPRC = 0.96 on 139 
manually abstracted notes from Yale community hospitals, and AUROC = 0.91 and 
AUPRC = 0.92 on 146 manually reviewed notes from MIMIC-III. Model-based 
predictions of HFrEF corresponded to a net reclassification improvement of 60.2% 
± 1.9% compared with diagnosis codes (P < 0.001).
CONCLUSIONS: The authors developed a language model that identifies HFrEF from 
clinical notes with high precision and accuracy, representing a key element in 
automating quality assessment for individuals with HFrEF.

BACKGROUND: Heart failure (HF) combined with diabetes is highly prevalent and is 
associated with more severe left ventricular dysfunction and a higher mortality 
rate. Early prediction of prognosis in such patients is crucial. This study aims 
to investigate the relationship between the lactate-to-albumin ratio (LAR) and 
outcomes in critically ill patients diagnosed with HF and diabetes.
METHODS: Data on critically ill HF patients with diabetes were retrospectively 
collected from the Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care IV (MIMIC-IV) 
database. Restricted cubic spline (RCS) analysis identified a threshold value of 
0.44, dividing patients into low-LAR (< 0.44) and high-LAR (≥ 0.44) groups. 
Least Absolute Shrinkage and Selection Operator (LASSO) regression with tenfold 
cross-validation identified variables associated with mortality. RCS, 
Kaplan-Meier curves, and Cox regression analyses were employed to evaluate the 
association between LAR and mortality. Subgroup analyses were conducted to 
validate the robustness of the findings.
RESULTS: A total of 3,774 patients were included, with a determined LAR cutoff 
value of 0.44. RCS analysis revealed a positive correlation between LAR and 
all-cause mortality at 90 days, 180 days, and 1 year. Cox regression analysis 
showed that both low-LAR and high-LAR groups were independent risk factors for 
all-cause mortality at 90 days, 180 days, and 1 year in HF patients with 
diabetes (P < 0.05). Kaplan-Meier survival curves demonstrated that the 
cumulative survival rates at 90 days, 180 days, and 1 year were lower in the 
low-LAR group compared to the high-LAR group. Subgroup analyses confirmed the 
stability of the association between LAR and all-cause mortality at all time 
points.
CONCLUSION: In summary, LAR is a reliable and independent predictor of increased 
mortality in critically ill HF patients with diabetes. However, additional 
comprehensive prospective studies are needed to validate these findings.

Heart failure (HF) is associated with poor prognosis. While various immune 
markers have been linked to HF outcomes, the relationship between eosinophils 
(EOS) and prognosis across different HF phenotypes remains unclear and 
controversial. In this study, we analyzed 2,677 HF patients from the Medical 
Information Mart for Intensive Care III (MIMIC-III) database, categorizing them 
into reduced ejection fraction (≤ 50%) and preserved ejection fraction (> 50%) 
groups. Multiple logistic regression, Kaplan-Meier survival curve estimation, 
Cox proportional hazards model, and restricted cubic splines were employed to 
assess the association between admission EOS and mortality. Subgroup analyses 
were conducted based on age, gender, sepsis, atrial fibrillation, hypertension 
and rheumatic and immunological diseases and mechanical ventilation. A total of 
954 patients with heart failure with reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF) and 1723 
patients with heart failure with preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF) were 
enrolled, with a female proportion of 37.84% and 56.88%, respectively. The 
median age of patients was 74.46 (IQR: 63.34-83.26) years and the median EOS was 
0.09 (IQR: 0.04-0.20). Among these patients, in-hospital mortality was 14.5% 
(389 patients), and the overall 90-day mortality rate reached 27.12% (726 
patients). There were no significant differences in EOS levels between the HFrEF 
and HFpEF groups (0.1 vs. 0.09, P = 0.154). After adjusting for confounders, 
multivariate logistic regression showed that higher EOS quartiles were 
associated with reduced in-hospital mortality in HFrEF patients, with quartile 3 
(Q3) (OR 0.54, 95% CI 0.31-0.96, P = 0.035) and Q4 (OR 0.37, 95% CI 0.19-0.71, 
P = 0.003) showing significant protective effects compared with the lowest EOS 
quartile (Q1), while Q2 did not reach statistical significance (P = 0.931). 
Subgroup analyses yielded similar findings. Multivariate Cox regression 
demonstrated a reduced hazard ratio in Q4 (HR 0.64, 95% CI 0.44-0.94, P = 0.023) 
compared with Q1 in HFrEF patients. However, no significant association was 
observed between EOS and prognosis in HFpEF. Our findings indicated that higher 
EOS was associated with improved in-hospital and 90-day survival in ICU patients 
with HFrEF, but not in those with HFpEF.

BACKGROUND: The triglyceride-glucose (TyG) index, renowned for its efficacy and 
convenience in assessing insulin resistance, has been validated as a reliable 
indicator for various cardiovascular conditions. The current study aims for 
clarifying the link of TyG with the incidences and prognoses of cardiac arrest 
(CA) following acute myocardial infarction (AMI).
METHODS: Our analysis is a multicenter, retrospective study utilizing data from 
the Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care IV and the eICU Collaborative 
Research Database. Patients with AMI for whom TyG could be calculated within the 
first 24 h after admission were included. The main endpoints were in-hospital 
and ICU mortalities. Correlations between TyG and outcomes were evaluated using 
logistic regression models, restricted cubic splines (RCS), as well as 
correlation and linear analyses. Overlap weighting (OW), inverse probability of 
treatment weighting (IPTW), and propensity score matching (PSM) methodologies 
were utilized to balance the cohorts, thereby minimizing potential biases. 
Subgroup analyses were performed in accordance with identified modifiers.
RESULTS: In total, 5208 individuals diagnosed with AMI, among whom 371 developed 
CA, were ultimately included. Higher TyG levels were observed among AMI 
populations with CA compared to those without [9.2 (8.7-9.7) vs. 9.0 (8.5-9.4)], 
and TyG demonstrated a moderate discriminatory capacity for identifying CA 
occurrences within entire AMI populations. Multivariate logistic regressions 
revealed TyG serves a significant risk indicator for both in-hospital (OR 1.711) 
and ICU mortalities (OR 1.520) in AMI-CA patients, and it is also associated 
with prolonged LOSs. RCS analyses confirmed linear relationships of ascending 
TyG with increased mortality risks for AMI-CA (P for nonlinearity: 0.592 and 
0.816, respectively), which persisted following PSM, OW, and IPTW adjustments. 
Subgroup analyses further identified a strong link of the TyG with mortality 
rates among elders, females, individuals with BMI < 28 kg/m2, and those with 
hypertension.
CONCLUSIONS: Elevated TyG levels were found to apparently correlate with higher 
prevalence and adverse outcomes regarding CA in patients with AMI. Our findings 
point a fresh insight into the significance of the TyG in critically ill 
coronary conditions.

BACKGROUND: Inflammation is involved in the development and progression of 
atherosclerosis. Recent studies indicated that glucose-to-lymphocyte ratio (GLR) 
level were significantly associated with the risk of mortality from inflammatory 
diseases, and showed a specific prognostic value. Herein, this study intended to 
explore the association between GLR level and in-hospital mortality in patients 
with acute myocardial infarction (AMI), and evaluate the predictive value of GLR 
on AMI prognosis.
METHODS: Data of patients with AMI were extracted from the Medical Information 
Mart for Intensive Care IV (MIMIC-IV) database in 2012-2019 in this 
retrospective cohort study. Univariate COX proportional hazard model was used to 
screen covariates. The associations between GLR and in-hospital mortality were 
evaluated using univariate and multivariate COX proportional hazard models. 
Subgroup analysis of age, gender, vasopressor use, SOFA scores, renal 
replacement therapy, coronary artery bypass graft, and β blockers use were 
performed. The evaluated index was hazard ratios (HRs) and 95% confidence 
intervals (CIs). In addition, the predictive performance of GLR, glucose, and 
lymphocytes on in-hospital mortality was assessed respectively.
RESULTS: Among eligible patients, 248 (13.74%) died in the hospital. After 
adjusting for covariates, we found that a higher GLR level was associated with 
an increased risk of in-hospital mortality [HR = 1.70, 95%CI: (1.24-2.34)]. This 
relationship was also found in patients who were male, aged ≥65 years old, did 
not have renal replacement therapy, coronary artery bypass graft, or β blockers, 
used vasopressor or not, and whatever the SOFA scores (all P<0.05). Moreover, 
the predictive performance of GLR on in-hospital mortality seemed superior to 
that of glucose or lymphocytes.
CONCLUSION: GLR may be a potential predictor for AMI prognosis, which provided 
some references for identifying and managing high-risk populations early in 
clinical.

BACKGROUND: The objective of this study was to develop and validate a machine 
learning (ML) model for predict in-hospital mortality among critically ill 
patients with congestive heart failure (CHF) combined with chronic kidney 
disease (CKD).
METHODS: After employing least absolute shrinkage and selection operator 
regression for feature selection, six distinct methodologies were employed in 
the construction of the model. The selection of the optimal model was based on 
the area under the curve (AUC). Furthermore, the interpretation of the chosen 
model was facilitated through the utilization of SHapley Additive exPlanation 
(SHAP) values and the Local Interpretable Model-Agnostic Explanations (LIME) 
algorithm.
RESULTS: This study collected data and enrolled 5041 patients on CHF combined 
with CKD from 2008 to 2019, utilizing the Medical Information Mart for Intensive 
Care Unit. After selection, 22 of the 47 variables collected post-intensive care 
unit admission were identified as mortality-associated and subsequently utilized 
in the development of ML models. Among the six models generated, the eXtreme 
Gradient Boosting (XGBoost) model demonstrated the highest AUC at 0.837. 
Notably, the SHAP values highlighted the sequential organ failure assessment 
score, age, simplified acute physiology score II, and urine output as the four 
most influential variables in the XGBoost model. In addition, the LIME algorithm 
explains the individualized predictions.
CONCLUSIONS: In conclusion, our study accomplished the successful development 
and validation of ML models for predicting in-hospital mortality in critically 
ill patients with CHF combined with CKD. Notably, the XGBoost model emerged as 
the most efficacious among all the ML models employed.

BACKGROUND: Predictive models based on machine learning have been widely used in 
clinical practice. Patients with acute myocardial infarction (AMI) are prone to 
the risk of acute kidney injury (AKI), which results in a poor prognosis for the 
patient. The aim of this study was to develop a machine learning predictive 
model for the identification of AKI in AMI patients.
METHODS: Patients with AMI who had been registered in the Medical Information 
Mart for Intensive Care (MIMIC) III and IV database were enrolled. The primary 
outcome was the occurrence of AKI during hospitalization. We developed Random 
Forests (RF) model, Naive Bayes (NB) model, Support Vector Machine (SVM) model, 
eXtreme Gradient Boosting (xGBoost) model, Decision Trees (DT) model, and 
Logistic Regression (LR) models with AMI patients in MIMIC-IV database. The 
importance ranking of all variables was obtained by the SHapley Additive 
exPlanations (SHAP) method. AMI patients in MIMIC-III databases were used for 
model evaluation. The area under the receiver operating characteristic curve 
(AUC) was used to compare the performance of each model.
RESULTS: A total of 3,882 subjects with AMI were enrolled through screening of 
the MIMIC database, of which 1,098 patients (28.2%) developed AKI. We randomly 
assigned 70% of the patients in the MIMIC-IV data to the training cohort, which 
is used to develop models in the training cohort. The remaining 30% is allocated 
to the testing cohort. Meanwhile, MIMIC-III patient data performs the external 
validation function of the model. 3,882 patients and 37 predictors were included 
in the analysis for model construction. The top 5 predictors were serum 
creatinine, activated partial prothrombin time, blood glucose concentration, 
platelets, and atrial fibrillation, (SHAP values are 0.670, 0.444, 0.398, 0.389, 
and 0.381, respectively). In the testing cohort, using top 20 important 
features, the models of RF, NB, SVM, xGBoost, DT model, and LR obtained AUC of 
0.733, 0.739, 0.687, 0.689, 0.663, and 0.677, respectively. Placing RF models of 
number of different variables on the external validation cohort yielded their 
AUC of 0.711, 0.754, 0.778, 0.781, and 0.777, respectively.
CONCLUSION: Machine learning algorithms, particularly the random forest 
algorithm, have improved the accuracy of risk stratification for AKI in AMI 
patients and are applied to accurately identify the risk of AKI in AMI patients.

BACKGROUND: The identification of efficient predictors for short-term mortality 
among patients with myocardial infarction (MI) in coronary care units (CCU) 
remains a challenge. This study seeks to investigate the potential of machine 
learning (ML) to improve risk prediction and develop a predictive model 
specifically tailored for 30-day mortality in critical MI patients.
METHOD: This study focused on MI patients extracted from the Medical Information 
Mart for Intensive Care-IV database. The patient cohort was randomly stratified 
into derivation (n = 1,389, 70%) and validation (n = 595, 30%) groups. 
Independent risk factors were identified through eXtreme Gradient Boosting 
(XGBoost) and random decision forest (RDF) methodologies. Subsequently, 
multivariate logistic regression analysis was employed to construct predictive 
models. The discrimination, calibration and clinical utility were assessed 
utilizing metrics such as receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve, 
calibration plot and decision curve analysis (DCA).
RESULT: A total of 1,984 patients were identified (mean [SD] age, 69.4 [13.0] 
years; 659 [33.2%] female). The predictive performance of the XGBoost and 
RDF-based models demonstrated similar efficacy. Subsequently, a 30-day mortality 
prediction algorithm was developed using the same selected variables, and a 
regression model was visually represented through a nomogram. In the validation 
group, the nomogram (Area Under the Curve [AUC]: 0.835, 95% Confidence Interval 
[CI]: [0.774-0.897]) exhibited superior discriminative capability for 30-day 
mortality compared to the Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (SOFA) score [AUC: 
0.735, 95% CI: (0.662-0.809)]. The nomogram (Accuracy: 0.914) and the SOFA score 
(Accuracy: 0.913) demonstrated satisfactory calibration. DCA indicated that the 
nomogram outperformed the SOFA score, providing a net benefit in predicting 
mortality.
CONCLUSION: The ML-based predictive model demonstrated significant efficacy in 
forecasting 30-day mortality among MI patients admitted to the CCU. The 
prognostic factors identified were age, blood urea nitrogen, heart rate, pulse 
oximetry-derived oxygen saturation, bicarbonate, and metoprolol use. This model 
serves as a valuable decision-making tool for clinicians.

BACKGROUND: To develop a prediction model for in-hospital mortality of patients 
with heart failure (HF) and atrial fibrillation (AF).
METHODS: This cohort study extracted the data of 10,236 patients with HF and AF 
upon intensive care unit (ICU) from the Medical Information Mart for Intensive 
Care (MIMIC). The subjects from MIMIC-IV were divided into the training set to 
construct the prediction model, and the testing set to verify the performance of 
the model. The samples from MIMIC-III database and eICU-CRD were included as the 
internal and external validation set to further validate the predictive value of 
the model, respectively. Univariate and multivariable Logistic regression 
analyses were used to explore predictors for in-hospital death in patients with 
HF and AF. The receiver operator characteristic (ROC), calibration curves and 
the decision curve analysis (DCA) curves were plotted to evaluate the predictive 
values of the model.
RESULTS: The mean survival time of participants from MIMIC-III was 
11.29 ± 10.05 days and the mean survival time of participants from MIMIC-IV was 
10.56 ± 9.19 days. Simplified acute physiology score (SAPSII), red blood cell 
distribution width (RDW), beta-blocker, race, respiratory rate, urine output, 
coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG), Charlson comorbidity index, renal 
replacement therapies (RRT), antiarrhythmic, age, and anticoagulation were 
predictors finally included in the prediction model. The AUC of our prediction 
model was 0.810 (95%CI: 0.791-0.828) in the training set, 0.757 (95%CI: 
0.729-0.786) in the testing set, 0.792 (95%CI: 0.774-0.810) in the internal 
validation set, and 0.724 (95%CI: 0.687-0.762) in the external validation set. 
The calibration curves of revealed that the predictive probabilities of our 
model for the in-hospital death in patients with HF and AF deviated slightly 
from the ideal model. The DCA curves revealed that the use of our prediction 
model increased the net benefit than use no model.
CONCLUSION: The prediction model had good discriminative ability, and might 
provide a tool to timely identify patients with HF complicated with AF who were 
at high risk of in-hospital mortality.

AIMS: Lactate/albumin ratio (L/A) is a recognized prognostic index of patients 
with heart failure (HF) after myocardial infarction (MI). We aim to evaluate the 
prognostic value of L/A ratio in predicting in-hospital mortality for those 
patients.
METHODS AND RESULTS: We enrolled qualified patients from Medical Information 
Mart for Intensive Care IV database for retrospective study. A receiver 
operating characteristic (ROC) curve of the subjects was applied to determine 
the predicted value and the best cut-off value of L/A on admission. 
Univariate/multivariate Cox regression analysis and restricted cubic splines 
(RCS) were performed to identify the association between hospital admission and 
hospital mortality. The Kaplan-Meier (KM) method was used to draw the survival 
curve of the two groups with different L/A levels at admission. L/A values at 
admission were significantly higher in the death groups than the survival groups 
[1.36 (1.20) vs. 0.62 (0.36), P < 0.05], and area under the ROC curve [0.780 
(95% confidence interval, 0.772-0.827)] was better than other indicators, and 
the best the cut-off value was 0.671. Data of Cox regression analysis showed 
that higher L/A value supposed to be an independent risk factor for in-hospital 
mortality. RCS analysis showed evidence of an increasing trend and a non-linear 
relationship between L/A and in-hospital mortality (P value was non-linear 
<0.05). KM survival curves were significantly lower in the high L/A group than 
the low L/A group (P < 0.001), and the former group had an increased risk of 
in-hospital mortality compared with the latter one (log rank P < 0.001).
CONCLUSIONS: Elevated L/A ratio on admission is an independent predictor of high 
in-hospital mortality in post-MI heart failure patients, which proved to be 
better than lactate, Sequential Organ Failure Assessment score and other related 
indicators.

AIMS: Heart failure is a critical health issue with high mortality rates. The 
blood urea nitrogen/creatinine ratio (BCR) has proven more effective at 
predicting outcomes in heart failure patients than individual assessments of 
each marker. Nevertheless, the implications of varying BCR levels for outcomes 
among heart failure patients remain to be fully understood. This study explores 
the impact of BCR on the outcomes of these patients.
METHODS AND RESULTS: Employing a retrospective cohort design at a single center, 
this study examined 1,475 heart failure patients from the Medical Information 
Mart for Intensive Care (MIMIC-III) database, categorized into four quartiles 
based on their BCR levels. We analyzed survival outcomes using Kaplan-Meier and 
Cox proportional hazards models, supplemented by restricted cubic splines to 
elucidate detailed associations. The average age of the patients was 69.52 
years, with males constituting 55.6% of the cohort. As BCR values escalated, the 
average hospital stay increased from 9.64 to 14.15 days, and average survival 
decreased from 685.11 to 412.68 days. Patients in the highest BCR quartile faced 
the most severe mortality rates, with 18.8% in-hospital and 78.3% long-term 
mortality. Nonlinear regression revealed a U-shaped relationship between BCR and 
mortality: at BCR levels below 12.5, there was no significant correlation with 
long-term mortality; between 12.5 and 22, BCR appeared to exert a protective 
effect; and above 22, it emerged as a significant risk factor.
CONCLUSIONS: Admission BCR values are non-linearly associated with mortality in 
heart failure patients, suggesting its utility as a prognostic tool in critical 
care.

BACKGROUND: Acute myocardial infarction (AMI) is one of the most severe 
cardiovascular diseases and is associated with a high risk of in-hospital 
mortality. However, the current deep learning models for in-hospital mortality 
prediction lack interpretability.
OBJECTIVE: This study aims to establish an explainable deep learning model to 
provide individualized in-hospital mortality prediction and risk factor 
assessment for patients with AMI.
METHODS: In this retrospective multicenter study, we used data for consecutive 
patients hospitalized with AMI from the Chongqing University Central Hospital 
between July 2016 and December 2022 and the Electronic Intensive Care Unit 
Collaborative Research Database. These patients were randomly divided into 
training (7668/10,955, 70%) and internal test (3287/10,955, 30%) data sets. In 
addition, data of patients with AMI from the Medical Information Mart for 
Intensive Care database were used for external validation. Deep learning models 
were used to predict in-hospital mortality in patients with AMI, and they were 
compared with linear and tree-based models. The Shapley Additive Explanations 
method was used to explain the model with the highest area under the receiver 
operating characteristic curve in both the internal test and external validation 
data sets to quantify and visualize the features that drive predictions.
RESULTS: A total of 10,955 patients with AMI who were admitted to Chongqing 
University Central Hospital or included in the Electronic Intensive Care Unit 
Collaborative Research Database were randomly divided into a training data set 
of 7668 (70%) patients and an internal test data set of 3287 (30%) patients. A 
total of 9355 patients from the Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care 
database were included for independent external validation. In-hospital 
mortality occurred in 8.74% (670/7668), 8.73% (287/3287), and 9.12% (853/9355) 
of the patients in the training, internal test, and external validation cohorts, 
respectively. The Self-Attention and Intersample Attention Transformer model 
performed best in both the internal test data set and the external validation 
data set among the 9 prediction models, with the highest area under the receiver 
operating characteristic curve of 0.86 (95% CI 0.84-0.88) and 0.85 (95% CI 
0.84-0.87), respectively. Older age, high heart rate, and low body temperature 
were the 3 most important predictors of increased mortality, according to the 
explanations of the Self-Attention and Intersample Attention Transformer model.
CONCLUSIONS: The explainable deep learning model that we developed could provide 
estimates of mortality and visual contribution of the features to the prediction 
for a patient with AMI. The explanations suggested that older age, unstable 
vital signs, and metabolic disorders may increase the risk of mortality in 
patients with AMI.

BACKGROUND: There has been a growing body of research focusing on patients with 
Congestive Heart Failure (CHF) and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) 
admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU). However, the optimal blood pressure 
(BP) level for such patients remains insufficiently explored. This study aimed 
to investigate the associations between systolic blood pressure (SBP) and 
in-hospital mortality among ICU patients with both CHF and COPD.
METHODS: This retrospective cohort study enrolled 6309 patients from the Medical 
Information Mart for Intensive Care IV (MIMIC-IV) database. SBP was examined as 
both a continuous and categorical variable, with the primary outcome being 
in-hospital mortality. The investigation involved multivariable logistic 
regression, restricted cubic spline regression, and subgroup analysis to 
determine the relationship between SBP and mortality.
RESULTS: The cohort consisted of 6309 patients with concurrent CHF and COPD 
(3246 females and 3063 males), with an average age of 73.0 ± 12.5 years. The 
multivariate analysis revealed an inverse association between SBP and 
in-hospital mortality, both as a continuous variable (odds ratio = 0.99 [95% CI, 
0.99~1]) and as a categorical variable (divided into quintiles). Restricted 
cubic spline analysis demonstrated an L-shaped relationship between SBP and 
mortality risk (P nonlinearity < 0.001), with an inflection point at 99.479 
mmHg. Stratified analyses further supported the robustness of this correlation.
CONCLUSION: The relationship between SBP and in-hospital mortality in patients 
with both CHF and COPD follows an L-shaped pattern, with an inflection point at 
approximately 99.479 mmHg.

Background: Thiamine deficiency is common in patients with heart failure, and 
thiamine supplement can benefit these patients. However, the association between 
thiamine administration and prognosis among critically ill patients with heart 
failure remains unclear. Thus, this study aims to prove the survival benefit of 
thiamine use in critically ill patients with heart failure. Methods: A 
retrospective cohort analysis was performed on the basis of the Medical 
Information Mart of Intensive Care-Ⅳ database. Critically ill patients with 
heart failure were divided into the thiamine and non-thiamine groups depending 
on whether they had received thiamine therapy or not during hospitalization. The 
association between thiamine supplement and in-hospital mortality was assessed 
by using the Kaplan-Meier (KM) method and Cox proportional hazard models. A 1:1 
nearest propensity-score matching (PSM) and propensity score-based inverse 
probability of treatment weighting (IPW) were also performed to ensure the 
robustness of the findings. Results: A total of 7,021 patients were included in 
this study, with 685 and 6,336 in the thiamine and non-thiamine groups, 
respectively. The kaplan-meier survival curves indicated that the thiamine group 
had a lower in-hospital mortality than the none-thiamine group. After adjusting 
for various confounders, the Cox regression models showed significant beneficial 
effects of thiamine administration on in-hospital mortality among critically ill 
patients with heart failure with a hazard ratio of 0.78 (95% confidence 
interval: 0.67-0.89) in the fully adjusted model. propensity-score matching and 
probability of treatment weighting analyses also achieved consistent results. 
Conclusion: Thiamine supplement is associated with a decreased risk of 
in-hospital mortality in critically ill patients with heart failure who are 
admitted to the ICU. Further multicenter and well-designed randomized controlled 
trials with large sample sizes are necessary to validate this finding.

BACKGROUND: Septic shock is a clinical syndrome characterized by the progression 
of sepsis to a severe stage. Elderly patients with urosepsis in the intensive 
care unit (ICU) are more likely to progress to septic shock. This study aimed to 
establish and validate a nomogram model for predicting the risk of progression 
to septic shock in elderly patients with urosepsis.
METHODS: We extracted data from the Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care 
(MIMIC-IV) and the eICU Collaborative Research Database (eICU-CRD). The MIMIC-IV 
dataset was split into a training set for model development and an internal 
validation set to assess model performance. Further external validation was 
performed using a distinct dataset sourced from the eICU-CRD. Predictors were 
screened using least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) 
regression and multivariable logistic regression analyses. The evaluation of 
model performance included discrimination, calibration, and clinical usefulness.
RESULTS: The study demonstrated that the Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS), white blood 
count (WBC), platelet, blood urea nitrogen (BUN), calcium, albumin, congestive 
heart failure (CHF), and invasive ventilation were closely associated with 
septic shock in the training cohort. Nomogram prediction, utilizing eight 
parameters, demonstrated strong predictive accuracy with area under the curve 
(AUC) values of 0.809 (95 % CI 0.786-0.834), 0.794 (95 % CI 0.756-0.831), and 
0.723 (95 % CI 0.647-0.801) in the training, internal validation, and external 
validation sets, respectively. Additionally, the nomogram demonstrated a 
promising calibration performance and significant clinical usefulness in both 
the training and validation sets.
CONCLUSION: The constructed nomogram is a reliable and practical tool for 
predicting the risk of progression to septic shock in elderly patients with 
urosepsis. Its implementation in clinical practice may enhance the early 
identification of high-risk patients, facilitate timely and targeted 
interventions to mitigate the risk of septic shock, and improve patient 
outcomes.

The association between the red blood cell distribution width-platelet ratio 
(RPR) and mortality in heart failure patients remains unclear. We aimed to 
investigate the potential non-linear relationship between RPR and 1-year 
mortality risk. A retrospective cohort study was conducted involving 6982 
participants from the Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care IV (MIMIC-IV) 
database. Multivariable Cox regression and restricted cubic spline analyses were 
performed to evaluate the association between RPR and 1-year mortality, 
adjusting for potential confounders. We observed 1091 patients died in hospital 
and 2535 patients died during 1 year follow-up period. The prevalence or 
incidence of mortality did not show statistically significant differences among 
RPR groups in the overall study population. However, a positive association 
between RPR and the risk of mortality was noted after adjusting for multiple 
variables (HR = 1.38, 95 % CI = 1.06-1.81, P = 0.018). Analysis using restricted 
cubic splines indicated a U-shaped relationship between RPR levels and the risk 
of mortality (P nonlinearity <0.05), with the point of lowest risk at 0.104. 
Compared to this level, lower RPR (<0.104) was associated with increased 
mortality (HR = 0.046, 95 % CI: 0.004-0.546), as was higher RPR (>0.104) 
(HR = 2.656, 95 % CI: 1.692-4.170).This U-shaped association was consistent 
across subgroup analyses (all interaction P values > 0.05). RPR exhibits a 
U-shaped association with 1-year mortality in heart failure patients, suggesting 
both low and high RPR levels are linked to increased risk. RPR may serve as a 
relevant biomarker for risk stratification in this population. We incorporated 
RPR into the SOFA (AUC 0.731) and SAPS II (AUC 0.746) models, which 
significantly improved their predictive ability for in-hospital mortality. For 
1-year mortality prediction, RPR + SAPS II (AUC 0.683) showed significantly 
improved accuracy, while RPR + SOFA (AUC 0.626) did not improve significantly.

PURPOSE: To investigate the effect of first 24-hour (24-h) urine output (UO) on 
in-hospital and 1-year mortality in patients admitted to intensive care units 
due to acute myocardial infarction.
METHODS: This was a retrospective cohort study based on the medical information 
mart for intensive care IV database involving patients admitted to intensive 
care units due to acute myocardial infarction. Patients were classified as low 
UO (LUO), high UO (HUO), and middle UO with a first 24-h UO below 800 ml, over 
2500 ml, or in between, respectively. The primary outcome was in-hospital 
mortality and the secondary outcome was 1-year mortality.
RESULTS: A total of 4337 patients were involved. Taking middle UO group as 
reference, after adjusting for confounders including age, gender, height, 
weight, comorbidity, occurrence of cardiogenic shock, revascularization, blood 
pressure, creatinine, N-terminal pro-brain natriuretic peptide, and use of loop 
diuretics, LUO was independently associated with higher in-hospital mortality 
[odds ratio 4.05, 95% confidence interval (CI): 3.12-5.26], while HUO was an 
independent protective factor (odds ratio 0.52, 95% CI: 0.35-0.77). In the 
multivariant Cox regression model, LUO was an independent risk factor for 1-year 
mortality (hazard ratio 2.65, 95% CI: 2.16-3.26), while HUO did not show 
significant association.
CONCLUSION: In patients admitted to intensive care units due to acute myocardial 
infarction, first 24-h UO <800 ml was a strong predictor for higher in-hospital 
and 1-year mortality, while first 24-h UO over 2500 ml was associated with lower 
in-hospital mortality but not long-term mortality.

BACKGROUND: Although blood glucose changes have been suggested to be a potential 
better target for clinical control than baseline blood glucose levels, the 
association of blood glucose changes with the prognosis in acute myocardial 
infarction (AMI) patients with diabetes mellitus (DM) is unclear. Herein, this 
study aimed to investigate association of short-term longitudinal trajectory of 
blood glucose with 30-day mortality in this population.
METHODS: Data of AMI patients with DM were extracted from the Medical 
Information Mart for Intensive Care (MIMIC) database in 2003-2019 in this 
retrospective cohort study. The latent growth mixture modeling (LGMM) model was 
utilized to classify the 24-hour longitudinal trajectory of blood glucose of the 
patients. Kaplan-Meier (KM) curve was drawn to show 30-day mortality risk in 
patients with different trajectory classes. Univariate and multivariate Cox 
regression analyses were employed to explore the association of longitudinal 
trajectory of blood glucose within 24 hours after the ICU admission with 30-day 
mortality. Also, subgroups analysis of age, gender, and AMI types was performed. 
The evaluation indexes were hazard ratios (HRs) and 95% confidence intervals 
(CIs).
RESULTS: Among 1,523 eligible patients, 227 (14.9%) died within 30 days. We 
identified 4 longitudinal trajectories of blood glucose, including class 1 (a 
low initial average blood glucose level with steady trend within 24 hours), 
class 2 (a high initial average blood glucose with gently decreased trend), 
class 3 (the highest initial average blood glucose with rapidly decreased trend) 
and class 4 (a high initial average blood glucose level with the trend that 
increased at first and then decreased). After adjusting for covariates, an 
average blood glucose level of ≥200 mg/dL was linked to higher risk of 30-day 
mortality, comparing to that of <140 mg/dL (HR = 1.80, 95%CI: 1.23-2.63). 
Comparing to patients whose longitudinal trajectory of blood glucose conformed 
to class 1, those with class 2 (HR = 2.52, 95%CI: 1.79-3.53) or class 4 (HR = 
3.53, 95%CI: 2.07-6.03) seemed to have higher risk of 30-day mortality. 
Additionally, these associations were also significant in aged ≥60 years old, 
female, male, NSTEMI, and STEMI subgroups (all P<0.05).
CONCLUSION: A low level of average blood glucose at the ICU admission or 
reducing blood glucose to a normal level quickly with adequate measures in 24 
hours after ICU admission may be beneficial for AMI patients with DM to reduce 
the risk of 30-day mortality. These findings may provide some information for 
further exploration on appropriate range of blood glucose changes in clinical 
practice.

AIMS: Myocardial infarction and heart failure are major cardiovascular diseases 
that affect millions of people in the USA with morbidity and mortality being 
highest among patients who develop cardiogenic shock. Early recognition of 
cardiogenic shock allows prompt implementation of treatment measures. Our 
objective is to develop a new dynamic risk score, called CShock, to improve 
early detection of cardiogenic shock in the cardiac intensive care unit (ICU).
METHODS AND RESULTS: We developed and externally validated a deep learning-based 
risk stratification tool, called CShock, for patients admitted into the cardiac 
ICU with acute decompensated heart failure and/or myocardial infarction to 
predict the onset of cardiogenic shock. We prepared a cardiac ICU dataset using 
the Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care-III database by annotating with 
physician-adjudicated outcomes. This dataset which consisted of 1500 patients 
with 204 having cardiogenic/mixed shock was then used to train CShock. The 
features used to train the model for CShock included patient demographics, 
cardiac ICU admission diagnoses, routinely measured laboratory values and vital 
signs, and relevant features manually extracted from echocardiogram and left 
heart catheterization reports. We externally validated the risk model on the New 
York University (NYU) Langone Health cardiac ICU database which was also 
annotated with physician-adjudicated outcomes. The external validation cohort 
consisted of 131 patients with 25 patients experiencing cardiogenic/mixed shock. 
CShock achieved an area under the receiver operator characteristic curve (AUROC) 
of 0.821 (95% CI 0.792-0.850). CShock was externally validated in the more 
contemporary NYU cohort and achieved an AUROC of 0.800 (95% CI 0.717-0.884), 
demonstrating its generalizability in other cardiac ICUs. Having an elevated 
heart rate is most predictive of cardiogenic shock development based on Shapley 
values. The other top 10 predictors are having an admission diagnosis of 
myocardial infarction with ST-segment elevation, having an admission diagnosis 
of acute decompensated heart failure, Braden Scale, Glasgow Coma Scale, blood 
urea nitrogen, systolic blood pressure, serum chloride, serum sodium, and 
arterial blood pH.
CONCLUSION: The novel CShock score has the potential to provide automated 
detection and early warning for cardiogenic shock and improve the outcomes for 
millions of patients who suffer from myocardial infarction and heart failure.

OBJECTIVE: To explore the relationship between Anion Gap (AG), Albumin Corrected 
AG (ACAG), and in-hospital mortality of Acute Myocardial Infarction (AMI) 
patients and develop a prediction model for predicting the mortality in AMI 
patients.
METHODS: This was a retrospective cohort study based on the Medical Information 
Mart for Intensive Care (MIMIC)-Ⅲ, MIMIC-IV, and eICU Collaborative Study 
Database (eICU). A total of 9767 AMI patients who were admitted to the intensive 
care unit were included. The authors employed univariate and multivariable cox 
proportional hazards analyses to investigate the association between AG, ACAG, 
and in-hospital mortality; p < 0.05 was considered statistically significant. A 
nomogram incorporating ACAG and clinical indicators was developed and validated 
for predicting mortality among AMI patients.
RESULTS: Both ACAG and AG exhibited a significant association with an elevated 
risk of in-hospital mortality in AMI patients. The C-index of ACAG (C-index = 
0.606) was significantly higher than AG (C-index = 0.589). A nomogram (ACAG 
combined model) was developed to predict the in-hospital mortality for AMI 
patients. The nomogram demonstrated a good predictive performance by Area Under 
the Curve (AUC) of 0.763 in the training set, 0.744 and 0.681 in the external 
validation cohort. The C-index of the nomogram was 0.759 in the training set, 
0.756 and 0.762 in the validation cohorts. Additionally, the C-index of the 
nomogram was obviously higher than the ACAG and age shock index in three 
databases.
CONCLUSION: ACAG was related to in-hospital mortality among AMI patients. The 
authors developed a nomogram incorporating ACAG and clinical indicators, 
demonstrating good performance for predicting in-hospital mortality of AMI 
patients.

INTRODUCTION: This study assessed the relationship between β-blockers treatment 
and in-hospital mortality among individuals diagnosed with heart failure (HF).
METHODS: A retrospective cohort study was carried out on 9,968 HF patients 
sourced from the Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care (MIMIC)-IV 
database. Propensity score matching (PSM) was employed to balance the baseline 
differences. A multivariate regression analysis was utilized to evaluate the 
impact of β-blockers therapy on in-hospital mortality.
RESULTS: Among the 9,968 patients, 6,439 (64.6%) were β-blockers users. Before 
matching, the overall in-hospital mortality rate was 12.2% (1,217/9,968). 
Following PSM, a total of 3,212 patient pairs were successfully matched. The 
analysis revealed a correlation between β-blockers therapy and decreased 
in-hospital mortality (odds ratio 0.51 [0.43-0.60], P < 0.001), as well as 
shorter Los (length of stay) hospital (β -1.43 [-1.96∼-0.09], P < 0.001). 
Notably, long-acting β-blockers treatment was linked to a decreased risk of 
in-hospital mortality (odds ratio 0.55 [0.46-0.65], P < 0.001) and a shorter Los 
hospital (β -1.21 [-1.80∼-0.63], P < 0.001). Conversely, the research results 
did not show a notable decrease in-hospital mortality (odds ratio 0.66 
[0.44-1.01], P = 0.051) or Los hospital (β -1.01 [-2.2∼-0.25], P = 0.117) 
associated with short-acting β-blocker therapy.
DISCUSSION: β-blockers therapy in the intensive care unit demonstrates potential 
benefits in lowering the risk of in-hospital mortality and reducing the duration 
of hospitalization among patients with HF. Specifically, long-acting β-blockers 
exhibit a protective effect by significantly decreasing both in-hospital 
mortality and Los hospital. Conversely, the study did not observe a substantial 
impact on in-hospital mortality or Los hospital duration in this cohort of 
patients following the administration of short-acting β-blockers.

AIMS: This study endeavors to explore the ramifications of early dynamic blood 
glucose (BG) trajectories within the initial 48 h of intensive care unit (ICU) 
admission on mortality among critically ill heart failure (HF) patients.
METHODS: The study employed a retrospective observational design, analyzing 
dynamic BG data of HF patients from the Medical Information Mart for Intensive 
Care IV database. The BG trajectory subphenotypes were identified using the 
hierarchical clustering based on the dynamic time-warping algorithm. The primary 
outcome of the study was 28-day mortality, with secondary outcomes including 
180-day and 1-year mortality.
RESULTS: We screened a total of 21,098 HF patients and finally 15,092 patients 
were included in the study. Our results identified three distinct BG trajectory 
subphenotypes: increasing (n = 3503), stabilizing (n = 6250), and decreasing 
(n = 5339). The increasing subphenotype was associated with the highest 
mortality risk at 28 days, 180 days, and 1 year. The stabilizing and decreasing 
subphenotypes showed significantly lower mortality risks across all time points, 
with hazard ratios ranging from 0.85 to 0.88 (P<0.05 for all). Sensitivity 
analyses confirmed the robustness of these findings after adjusting for various 
covariates.
CONCLUSIONS: Increasing BG trajectory within 48 h of admission is significantly 
associated with higher mortality in patients with HF. It is necessary to devote 
greater attention to the early BG dynamic changes in HF patients to optimize 
clinical BG management and enhance patient prognosis.

BACKGROUND: Frailty correlates with adverse outcomes in many cardiovascular 
diseases and is prevalent in individuals with heart failure (HF). The Hospital 
Frailty Risk Score (HFRS) offers an integrated, validated solution for frailty 
assessment in acute care settings, but its application in critically ill 
patients with congestive HF lacks exploration. This study aimed to identify the 
association between frailty assessed by the HFRS and in-hospital mortality in 
critically ill patients with congestive HF.
METHODS: This observational study retrospectively enrolled 12,179 critically ill 
patients with congestive HF. Data from the Medical Information Mart for 
Intensive Care IV database was used. The HFRS was calculated to assess frailty. 
Patients were categorized into three groups: non-frailty (HFRS < 5, n = 7,961), 
pre-frailty (5 ≤ HFRS < 15, n = 3,684), and frailty (HFRS ≥ 15, n = 534). 
Outcomes included in-hospital mortality, length of intensive care unit stay, and 
length of hospital stay. Multiple logistic regression and Locally Weighted 
Scatterplot Smoothing (LOWESS) smoother were used to investigate the association 
between frailty and outcomes. Subgroup analysis was employed to elucidate the 
correlation between frailty levels and in-hospital mortality across diverse 
subgroups.
RESULTS: 12,179 patients were enrolled, 6,679 (54.8%) were male, and the average 
age was 71.05 ± 13.94 years. The overall in-hospital mortality was 11.7%. 
In-hospital mortality increased with the escalation of frailty levels 
(non-frailty vs. pre-frailty vs. frailty: 9.7% vs. 14.8% vs. 20.2%, P < 0.001). 
The LOWESS curve demonstrated that the HFRS was monotonically positively 
correlated with in-hospital mortality. Upon controlling for potential 
confounders, both pre-frailty and frailty statuses were found to be 
independently linked to a heightened risk of mortality during hospitalization 
(odds ratio [95% confidence interval]: pre-frailty vs. non-frailty: 1.27 
[1.10-1.47], P = 0.001; frailty vs. non-frailty: 1.40 [1.07-1.83], P = 0.015; P 
for trend < 0.001). Significant interactions between frailty levels and 
in-hospital mortality were observed in the following subgroups: race, heart 
rate, creatinine, antiplatelet drug, diabetes, cerebrovascular disease, chronic 
renal disease, and sepsis.
CONCLUSION: In critically ill patients with congestive HF, frailty as assessed 
by the HFRS emerged as an independent predictor for the risk of in-hospital 
mortality. Prospective, randomized studies are required to determine whether 
improvement of frailty levels could improve clinical prognosis.

OBJECTIVE: High glycemic variability (GV) often indicates a poor prognosis. Our 
aim is to investigate the relationship between GV and short and long-term 
mortality in critically ill heart failure (HF) patients.
METHODS: We extracted data from the Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care 
IV database. The risks of in-hospital and 1-year mortality were calculated using 
Logistic and COX regression. In addition, mediation analysis was used to 
investigate the indirect effect of ventricular arrhythmias (VA) on in-hospital 
mortality.
RESULTS: Among 8,980 critically ill HF patients, the multifactorial regression 
analysis showed that high GV was associated with an increased risk of 
in-hospital and 1-year mortality (OR 1.69, 95 % CI 1.47-1.93; HR 1.12, 95 % CI 
1.02-1.22). The Kaplan-Meier survival curve and restricted cubic spline plot 
also emphasized this association. Furthermore, the impact of GV on in-hospital 
mortality was partially mediated by VA (4.98%). And the increased risk of 1-year 
mortality associated with high GV was more significant in person with diabetes 
(p for interaction =0.018).
CONCLUSION: Our Study indicates that high GV may be an independent risk factor 
for short and long-term mortality in critically ill HF patients. Maintaining the 
stability of blood glucose can reduce adverse outcomes in critically ill HF 
patients.

Background: Traumatic brain injury-induced coagulopathy (TBI-IC), is a disease 
with poor prognosis and increased mortality rate. Objectives: Our study aimed to 
identify predictors as well as develop machine learning (ML) models to predict 
the risk of coagulopathy in this population. Methods: ML models were developed 
and validated based on two public databases named Medical Information Mart for 
Intensive Care (MIMIC)-IV and the eICU Collaborative Research Database 
(eICU-CRD). Candidate predictors, including demographics, family history, 
comorbidities, vital signs, laboratory findings, injury type, therapy strategy 
and scoring system were included. Models were compared on area under the curve 
(AUC), accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, positive and negative predictive 
values, and decision curve analysis (DCA) curve. Results: Of 999 patients in 
MIMIC-IV included in the final cohort, a total of 493 (49.35%) patients 
developed coagulopathy following TBI. Recursive feature elimination (RFE) 
selected 15 variables, including international normalized ratio (INR), 
prothrombin time (PT), sepsis related organ failure assessment (SOFA), activated 
partial thromboplastin time (APTT), platelet (PLT), hematocrit (HCT), red blood 
cell (RBC), hemoglobin (HGB), blood urea nitrogen (BUN), red blood cell volume 
distribution width (RDW), creatinine (CRE), congestive heart failure, myocardial 
infarction, sodium, and blood transfusion. The external validation in eICU-CRD 
demonstrated that adapting boosting (Ada) model had the highest AUC of 0.924 
(95% CI: 0.902-0.943). Furthermore, in the DCA curve, the Ada model and the 
extreme Gradient Boosting (XGB) model had relatively higher net benefits (ie, 
the correct classification of coagulopathy considering a trade-off between 
false- negatives and false-positives)-over other models across a range of 
threshold probability values. Conclusions: The ML models, as indicated by our 
study, can be used to predict the incidence of TBI-IC in the intensive care unit 
(ICU).

Serum anion gap (AG) is closely related to mortality in critically ill patients 
with several diseases. We aimed to determine the relationship between serum AG 
levels and 28-day intensive care unit (ICU) mortality in patients with diastolic 
heart failure (DHF). This cohort study enrolled critically ill patients with DHF 
from the Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care IV (MIMIC-IV) database. 
Serum AG levels were calculated using the traditional and albumin-adjusted 
methods. Multivariate Cox proportional hazards regression and restricted cubic 
spline curves were used to determine the correlation between serum AG levels and 
28-day ICU mortality. We used receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves and 
area under the curve (AUC) to compare the ability of traditional and 
albumin-adjusted AG to predict mortality. Overall, 3290 patients were included. 
Multivariate analysis showed an association of high levels of traditional 
(hazard ratio [HR], 1.48; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.1-1.98, p = 0.009) and 
albumin-adjusted AG (HR, 1.36; 95% CI, 1.02-1.79, p = 0.033) with higher risk of 
28-day ICU mortality. Restricted cubic spline curves indicated a linear 
relationship between AG level and 28-day ICU mortality. Comparison of the ROC 
curves revealed that albumin-adjusted AG had a greater ability to predict 28-day 
ICU mortality compared with traditional AG (AUCs of 0.569 [95% CI, 0.536-0.601] 
and 0.619 [95% CI, 0.588-0.649], respectively). In ICU patients with DHF, higher 
levels of traditional and albumin-adjusted AG were associated with higher 28-day 
ICU mortality. Albumin-adjusted AG exhibited greater predictive ability for 
mortality compared with traditional AG.

Previous studies have reported that the significant association between serum 
calcium and mortality substantially in patients, especially among those with 
intensive care unit (ICU). And In diabetes mellitus, congestive heart failure 
(CHF) is a significant comorbidity. We aim to evaluate the association between 
serum calcium levels and in-hospital mortality among patients with diabetes and 
congestive heart failure. The participants in this study were extracted from the 
Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care IV (MIMIC-IV) database. To 
scrutinize potential associations between serum calcium levels and in-hospital 
mortality, a comprehensive analysis encompassing multivariate logistic 
regression, cubic spline function model, threshold effect analysis, and subgroup 
analysis was performed. This retrospective cohort study encompassed 7063 
patients, among whom the in-hospital mortality stood at 12.2%. In the 
multivariate logistic regression, adjusted odds ratios (ORs) were contrasted 
with the reference category Q6 (8.8-9.1 mg/dL) for serum calcium levels and 
in-hospital mortality. The adjusted ORs for Q1 (≤ 7.7 mg/dL), Q2 (7.7-8 mg/dL), 
and Q7 (≥ 9.1 mg/dL) were 1.69 (95% CI 1.17-2.44, p = 0.005), 1.62 (95% CI 
1.11-2.36, p = 0.013), and 1.57 (95% CI 1.1-2.24, p = 0.012) respectively. The 
dose-response analysis uncovered a U-shaped relationship between serum calcium 
levels and in-hospital mortality in diabetic patients with heart failure. 
Subgroup analyses confirmed result stability notwithstanding the influence of 
diverse factors. Our investigation revealed a U-shaped correlation between serum 
calcium levels and in-hospital mortality in diabetes patients with congestive 
heart failure, pinpointing a significant inflection point at 9.05 mg/dL.

Chronic heart failure (CHF) poses a significant threat to human health. The 
stress hyperglycemia ratio (SHR) is a novel metric for accurately assessing 
stress hyperglycemia, which has been correlated with adverse outcomes in various 
major diseases. However, it remains unclear whether SHR is associated with 
28-day mortality in patients with pre-existing CHF who were admitted to 
intensive care units (ICUs). This study retrospectively recruited patients who 
were admitted to ICUs with both acute critical illness and pre-existing CHF from 
the Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care (MIMIC) database. 
Characteristics were compared between the survival and non-survival groups. The 
relationship between SHR and 28-day all-cause mortality was analyzed using 
restricted cubic splines, receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves, 
Kaplan-Meier survival analysis, and Cox proportional hazards regression 
analysis. The importance of the potential risk factors was assessed using the 
Boruta algorithm. Prediction models were constructed using machine learning 
algorithms. A total of 913 patients were enrolled. The risk of 28-day mortality 
increased with higher SHR levels (P < 0.001). SHR was independently associated 
with 28-day all-cause mortality, with an unadjusted hazard ratio (HR) of 1.45 
(P < 0.001) and an adjusted HR of 1.43 (P < 0.001). Subgroup analysis found that 
none of the potential risk factors, such as demographics, comorbidities, and 
drugs, affected the relationship (P for interaction > 0.05). The area under the 
ROC (AUC) curve for SHR was larger than those for admission blood glucose and 
HbA1c; the cut-off for SHR was 0.57. Patients with SHR higher than the cut-off 
had a significantly lower 28-day survival probability (P < 0.001). SHR was 
identified as one of the key factors for 28-day mortality by the Boruta 
algorithm. The predictive performance was verified through four machine learning 
algorithms, with the neural network algorithm being the best (AUC 0.801). For 
patients with both acute critical illness and pre-existing CHF, SHR was an 
independent predictor of 28-day all-cause mortality. Its prognostic performance 
surpasses those of HbA1c and blood glucose, and prognostic models based on SHR 
provide clinicians with an effective tool to make therapeutic decisions.

OBJECTIVE: Risk stratification of patients with congestive heart failure (HF) is 
vital in clinical practice. The aim of this study was to construct a machine 
learning model to predict the in-hospital all-cause mortality for intensive care 
unit (ICU) patients with HF.
METHODS: eXtreme Gradient Boosting algorithm (XGBoost) was used to construct a 
new prediction model (XGBoost model) from the Medical Information Mart for 
Intensive Care IV database (MIMIC-IV) (training set). The eICU Collaborative 
Research Database dataset (eICU-CRD) was used for the external validation (test 
set). The XGBoost model performance was compared with a logistic regression 
model and an existing model (Get with the guideline-Heart Failure model) for 
mortality in the test set. Area under the receiver operating characteristic cure 
and Brier score were employed to evaluate the discrimination and the calibration 
of the three models. The SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) value was applied 
to explain XGBoost model and calculate the importance of its features.
RESULTS: The total of 11,156 and 9,837 patients with congestive HF from the 
training set and test set, respectively, were included in the study. In-hospital 
all-cause mortality occurred in 13.3% (1,484/11,156) and 13.4% (1,319/9,837) of 
patients, respectively. In the training set, of 17 features with the highest 
predictive value were selected into the models with LASSO regression. Acute 
Physiology Score III (APS III), age and Sequential Organ Failure Assessment 
(SOFA) were strongest predictors in SHAP. In the external validation, the 
XGBoost model performance was superior to that of conventional risk predictive 
methods, with an area under the curve of 0.771 (95% confidence interval, 
0.757-0.784) and a Brier score of 0.100. In the evaluation of clinical 
effectiveness, the machine learning model brought a positive net benefit in the 
threshold probability of 0%-90%, prompting evident competitiveness compare to 
the other two models. This model has been translated into an online calculator 
which is accessible freely to the public 
(https://nkuwangkai-app-for-mortality-prediction-app-a8mhkf.streamlit.app).
CONCLUSION: This study developed a valuable machine learning risk stratification 
tool to accurately assess and stratify the risk of in-hospital all-cause 
mortality in ICU patients with congestive HF. This model was translated into a 
web-based calculator which access freely.

BACKGROUND: Propofol and midazolam are commonly used sedative drugs in 
mechanically ventilated patients in the Intensive Care Unit (ICU). However, 
there is still a lack of relevant studies exploring the influence of midazolam 
and propofol on the prognosis of patients with Sepsis-associated Acute Kidney 
Injury (S-AKI).
PATIENTS AND METHODS: A statistical analysis was conducted on 3,745 patients 
with S-AKI in the Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care IV database. The 
patients' baseline characteristics were grouped based on the use of either 
propofol or midazolam as sedatives. Cox proportional hazards models, logistic 
regression models, and subgroup analyses were used to compare the effects of 
propofol and midazolam on the short-term prognosis of S-AKI patients, including 
30-day mortality, ICU mortality, and duration of mechanical ventilation.
RESULTS: In the statistical analysis, a total of 3,745 patients were included, 
with 649 patients using midazolam and 3,096 patients using propofol. In terms of 
the 30-day mortality, compared to patients using midazolam, S-AKI patients using 
propofol had a lower ICU mortality (hazard ratio = 0.62, 95% confidence 
interval: 0.52-0.74, p < 0.001), lower 30-day mortality (hazard ratio = 0.56, 
95% confidence interval: 0.47-0.67, p < 0.001), and shorter mechanical 
ventilation time (odds ratio = 0.72, 95% confidence interval: 0.59-0.88, 
p < 0.001). Kaplan-Meier curves showed lower survival probabilities in the 
midazolam group (p < 0.001). Subgroup analyses showed that propofol was strongly 
protective of short-term prognosis in older, male, smaller SOFA score CCI score, 
no heart failure, and comorbid chronic kidney disease patients with S-AKI.
CONCLUSION: Compared to midazolam, propofol was considered a protective factor 
for short-term mortality risk and ICU mortality risk in S-AKI patients. 
Additionally, S-AKI patients using propofol had a lower risk of requiring 
prolonged mechanical ventilation. Overall, propofol may be more beneficial for 
the short-term prognosis of S-AKI patients compared to midazolam.

INTRODUCTION: The relationship between relative hyperglycemia and ventricular 
arrhythmia (VA) in critically ill patients admitted to intensive care units 
(ICU) remains unclear. This study aims to investigate the association between 
stress hyperglycemia ratio (SHR) and VA in this population.
METHODS: This retrospective and observational study analyzed data from 4324 
critically ill patients admitted to the ICU, obtained from the Medical 
Information Mart for Intensive Care IV (MIMIC-IV) database. The SHR was 
calculated as the highest blood glucose level during the first 24 h of ICU 
admission divided by the admission blood glucose level. Based on the optimal 
cut-off values under the receiver operating characteristic curve, patients were 
stratified into high SHR (≥ 1.31) and low SHR (< 1.31) group. To investigate the 
impact of diabetes mellitus (DM) on the outcome, patients were stratified as low 
SHR/DM; low SHR/non-DM; high SHR/DM, and high SHR/non-DM. Restricted cubic 
spline (RCS) and logistic regression analysis were performed to analyze the 
relationship between SHR and VA.
RESULTS: A total of 4,324 critically ill patients were included in this 
retrospective and observational study. The incidence of VA was higher in the 
high SHR group. Multiple-adjusted RCS revealed a "J-shaped" correlation between 
SHR and VA morbidity. The logistic regression model demonstrated that high SHR 
was associated with VA. The high SHR/non-DM group had a higher risk of VA than 
other groups stratified based on SHR and DM. Subgroup analysis showed that high 
SHR was associated with an increased risk of VA in patients with coronary artery 
disease.
CONCLUSION: High SHR is an independent risk factor and has potential as a 
biomarker of higher VT/VF risk in ICU-admitted patients.

BACKGROUND: Volume overload is a common complication encountered in hospitalized 
patients, and the mainstay of therapy is diuresis. Unfortunately, the diuretic 
response in some individuals is inadequate despite a typical dose of loop 
diuretics, a phenomenon called diuretic resistance. An accurate prediction model 
that predicts diuretic resistance using predosing variables could inform the 
right diuretic dose for a prospective patient.
METHODS: Two large, deidentified, publicly available, and independent intensive 
care unit (ICU) databases from the United States were used-the Medical 
Information Mart for Intensive Care III (MIMIC) and the Philips eICU databases. 
Loop diuretic resistance was defined as <1400 ml of urine per 40 mg of diuretic 
dose in 24 hours. Using 24-hour windows throughout admission, commonly 
accessible variables were obtained and incorporated into the model. Data 
imputation was performed using a highly accurate machine learning method. Using 
XGBoost, several models were created using train and test datasets from the eICU 
database. These were then combined into an ensemble model optimized for 
increased specificity and then externally validated on the MIMIC database.
RESULTS: The final ensemble model was composed of four separate models, each 
using 21 commonly available variables. The ensemble model outperformed 
individual models during validation. Higher serum creatinine, lower systolic 
blood pressure, lower serum chloride, higher age, and female sex were the most 
important predictors of diuretic resistance (in that order). The specificity of 
the model on external validation was 92%, yielding a positive likelihood ratio 
of 3.46 while maintaining overall discrimination (C-statistic 0.69).
CONCLUSIONS: A diuretic resistance prediction model was created using machine 
learning and was externally validated in ICU populations. The model is easy to 
use, would provide actionable information at the bedside, and would be ready for 
implementation in existing electronic medical records. This study also provides 
a framework for the development of future machine learning models.

BACKGROUND: Patients with heart failure (HF) with diabetes may face a poorer 
prognosis and higher mortality than patients with either disease alone, 
especially for those in intensive care unit. So far, there is no precise 
mortality risk prediction indicator for this kind of patient.
METHOD: Two high-quality critically ill databases, the Medical Information Mart 
for Intensive Care IV (MIMIC-IV) database and the Telehealth Intensive Care Unit 
(eICU) Collaborative Research Database (eICU-CRD) Collaborative Research 
Database, were used for study participants' screening as well as internal and 
external validation. Nine machine learning models were compared, and the best 
one was selected to define indicators associated with hospital mortality for 
patients with HF with diabetes. Existing attributes most related to hospital 
mortality were identified using a visualization method developed for machine 
learning, namely, Shapley Additive Explanations (SHAP) method. A new composite 
indicator ASL was established using logistics regression for patients with HF 
with diabetes based on major existing indicators. Then, the new index was 
compared with existing indicators to confirm its discrimination ability and 
clinical value using the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve, decision 
curve, and calibration curve.
RESULTS: The random forest model outperformed among nine models with the area 
under the ROC curve (AUC) = 0.92 after hyper-parameter optimization. By using 
this model, the top 20 attributes associated with hospital mortality in these 
patients were identified among all the attributes based on SHAP method. Acute 
Physiology Score (APS) III, Sepsis-related Organ Failure Assessment (SOFA), and 
Max lactate were selected as major attributes related to mortality risk, and a 
new composite indicator was developed by combining these three indicators, which 
was named as ASL. Both in the initial and external cohort, the new indicator, 
ASL, had greater risk discrimination ability with AUC higher than 0.80 in both 
low- and high-risk groups compared with existing attributes. The decision curve 
and calibration curve indicated that this indicator also had a respectable 
clinical value compared with APS III and SOFA. In addition, this indicator had a 
good risk stratification ability when the patients were divided into three risk 
levels.
CONCLUSION: A new composite indicator for predicting mortality risk in patients 
with HF with diabetes admitted to intensive care unit was developed on the basis 
of attributes identified by the random forest model. Compared with existing 
attributes such as APS III and SOFA, the new indicator had better discrimination 
ability and clinical value, which had potential value in reducing the mortality 
risk of these patients.

BACKGROUND: Both in-hospital cardiac arrest (IHCA) and out-of-hospital cardiac 
arrest (OHCA) have higher incidence and lower survival rates. Predictors of 
in-hospital mortality for intensive care unit (ICU) admitted cardiac arrest (CA) 
patients remain unclear.
METHODS: The Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care IV (MIMIC-IV) database 
was used to perform a retrospective study. Patients meeting the inclusion 
criteria were identified from the MIMIC-IV database and randomly divided into 
training set (n = 1206, 70%) and validation set (n = 516, 30%). Candidate 
predictors consisted of the demographics, comorbidity, vital signs, laboratory 
test results, scoring systems, and treatment information on the first day of ICU 
admission. Independent risk factors for in-hospital mortality were screened 
using the least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) regression 
model and the extreme gradient boosting (XGBoost) in the training set. 
Multivariate logistic regression analysis was used to build prediction models in 
training set, and then validated in validation set. Discrimination, calibration 
and clinical utility of these models were compared using the area under the 
curve (AUC) of the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves, calibration 
curves and decision curve analysis (DCA). After pairwise comparison, the best 
performing model was chosen to build a nomogram.
RESULTS: Among the 1722 patients, in-hospital mortality was 53.95%. In both 
sets, the LASSO, XGBoost,the logistic regression(LR) model and the National 
Early Warning Score 2 (NEWS 2) models showed acceptable discrimination. In 
pairwise comparison, the prediction effectiveness was higher with the 
LASSO,XGBoost and LR models than the NEWS 2 model (p < 0.001). The LASSO,XGBoost 
and LR models also showed good calibration. The LASSO model was chosen as our 
final model for its higher net benefit and wider threshold range. And the LASSO 
model was presented as the nomogram.
CONCLUSIONS: The LASSO model enabled good prediction of in-hospital mortality in 
ICU admission CA patients, which may be widely used in clinical decision-making.

Acute kidney injury (AKI) is one of the common complications of pulmonary 
infections. However, nomograms predicting the risk of early-onset AKI in 
patients with pulmonary infections have not been comprehensively researched. In 
this study, 3278 patients with pulmonary infection were extracted from the 
Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care III (MIMIC-III) database. These 
patients were randomly divided into training and validation cohorts, with the 
training cohort used for model building and the validation cohort used for 
validation. Independent risk factors for patients with pulmonary infection were 
determined using the least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) 
method and forward stepwise logistic regression, which revealed that 11 
independent risk factors for AKI in patients with pulmonary infections were 
congestive heart failure (CHF), hypertension, diabetes, transcutaneous oxygen 
saturation (SpO2), 24-h urine output, white blood cells (WBC), serum creatinine 
(Scr), prothrombin time (PT), potential of hydrogen (PH), vasopressor use, and 
mechanical ventilation (MV) use. The nomogram was then constructed and 
validated. The area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) 
values of the nomogram were 0.770 (95% CI = 0.789-0.807) in the training cohort 
and 0.724 (95% CI = 0.754-0.784) in the validation cohort. High AUC values 
indicated the good discriminative ability of the nomogram, while the calibration 
curves and Hosmer-Lemeshow test results indicated that the nomogram was 
well-calibrated. Improvements in net reclassification index (NRI) and integrated 
discrimination improvement (IDI) values indicate that our nomogram was superior 
to the Simplified Acute Physiology Score (SAPS) II scoring system, and the 
decision-curve analysis (DCA) curves indicate that the nomogram has good 
clinical application. We established a risk-prediction model for AKI in patients 
with pulmonary infection, which has good discriminative power and is superior to 
the SAPS II scoring system. This model can provide clinical reference 
information for patients with this type of disease in the intensive care unit.

BACKGROUND: Elevated circulating levels of albumin (ALB) are often associated 
with improved prognosis in patients with heart failure (HF). However, 
investigations of its association with hospital death and long-term death in HF 
patients in the intensive care unit (ICU) are limited.
AIM: We examined whether increased blood ALB levels (first value at admission 
and maximum and minimum values in the ICU) were related to a greater risk of 
hospital death and long-term death in ICU patients with HF.
METHODS: For the first time, we analyzed 4084 ICU patients with HF admitted to 
the ICU in The Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care III (MIMIC-III) 
database.
RESULTS: Among 4084 HF patients, 774 (18.95%), 1056 (25.86%) and 1720 (42.12%) 
died in the hospital, within 30 days and 1 year, respectively. We conducted a 
logistic regression analysis and found significant inverse associations between 
blood ALB concentration and risk of hospital death, 30-day death and 1-year 
death when the covariates including age, sex, myocardial infarction (MI), 
hypertension, diabetes, valvular diseases, atrial fibrillation, stroke and 
chronic kidney disease (CKD) were adjusted. We additionally used a smooth curve 
for univariate analysis to establish an association between blood ALB 
concentration and death risk. Surprisingly, we observed U-shaped correlations 
between blood ALB concentration and hospital mortality, 30-day mortality and 
1-year mortality. We found that the "inflection point" for the blood ALB 
concentration at the lowest risk of death was 3.5 g/dL. We further observed that 
a higher blood ALB concentration (albumin-max) did not contribute to a reduced 
risk of death (hospital death, 30-day death and 1-year death) in HF patients 
with an albumin concentration >3.5 g/dL.
CONCLUSIONS: A lower blood ALB concentration contributed to a greater risk of 
hospital death and long-term death in HF patients admitted to the ICU, further 
suggesting that nutritional support in the ICU is highly important for improving 
the short-term and long-term mortality of HF patients. However, in HF patients 
without hypoproteinaemia (>3.5 g/dL), the impact of increased serum ALB on 
patient prognosis still needs to be demonstrated.

INTRODUCTION: Dysnatremia is strongly associated with poor prognosis in acute 
kidney injury (AKI); however, the impact of sodium trajectories on the prognosis 
of patients with AKI has not yet been well elucidated. This study aimed to 
assess the association between sodium trajectories in patients with AKI and 
mortality at 30-day and 1-year follow-up.
METHODS: This retrospective cohort study used data from Medical Information Mart 
for Intensive Care (MIMIC)-IV database, and patients diagnosed with AKI within 
48 h after admission were enrolled. Group-based trajectory models (GBTM) were 
applied to map the developmental course of the serum sodium fluctuations. 
Kaplan-Meier survival curve was used to compare differences in mortality in AKI 
patients with distinct serum sodium trajectories. Hazard ratios (HRs) were 
calculated to determine the association between trajectories and prognosis using 
Cox proportional hazard models.
RESULTS: A total of 9,314 AKI patients were enrolled. Three distinct sodium 
trajectories were identified including: (i) stable group (ST, in which the serum 
sodium levels remained relatively stable, n = 4,935; 53.0%), (ii) descending 
group (DS, in which the serum sodium levels declined, n = 2,994; 32.15%) and 
(iii) ascending group (AS, in which the serum sodium levels were elevated, 
n = 1,383; 14.85%). There was no significant difference in age and gender 
distribution among the groups. The 30-day mortality rates were 7.9% in ST, 9.5% 
in DS and 16.6% in AS (p < 0.001). The results of 1-year mortality rates were 
similar (p < 0.001). In adjusted analysis, patients in the DS (HR = 1.22, 95% 
confidence interval [CI], 1.04-1.43, p = 0.015) and AS (HR = 1.68, 95% CI, 
1.42-2.01, p = 0.013) groups had higher risks of 30-day mortality compared to 
those in the ST group.
CONCLUSION: In patients with AKI, the serum sodium trajectories were 
independently associated with 30-day and 1-year mortality. Association between 
serum sodium level trajectories and prognosis in patients with AKI deserve 
further study.

BACKGROUND: Hip fracture is a prevalent and hazardous injury among the elderly 
population that often results in intensive care unit (ICU) admission due to 
various complications, despite advanced medical science. One common complication 
experienced in the ICU by elderly hip fracture patients is heart failure, which 
significantly impacts short-term survival rates. Currently, there is a deficit 
of adequate predictive models to forecast the short-term risk of death following 
heart failure for elderly hip fracture patients in the ICU. This study aims to 
identify independent risk factors for all-cause mortality within 30 days for 
elderly patients with hip fractures and heart failure while in the ICU in order 
to develop a predictive model.
METHOD: A total of 641 elderly patients with hip fractures combined with heart 
failure were recruited from the Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care IV 
dataset and randomized to the training and validation sets. The primary outcome 
was all-cause mortality within 30 days. The least absolute shrinkage and 
selection operator regression was used to reduce data dimensionality and select 
features. Multivariate logistic regression was used to build predictive models. 
Consistency index (C-index), receiver operating characteristic curve, and 
decision curve analysis (DCA) were used to measure the predictive performance of 
the nomogram.
RESULT: Our results showed that these variables including MCH, MCV, INR, 
monocyte percentage, neutrophils percentage, creatinine, and combined sepsis 
were independent factors for death within 30 days in elderly patients with hip 
fracture combined with heart failure in the ICU. The C-index was 0.869 (95% CI 
0.823-0.916) and 0.824 (95% CI 0.749-0.900) for the training and validation 
sets, respectively. The results of the area under the curve and decision curve 
analysis (DCA) confirmed that the nomogram performed well in predicting elderly 
patients with hip fractures combined with heart failure in the ICU.
CONCLUSION: We developed a new nomogram model for predicting 30-day all-cause 
mortality in elderly patients with hip fractures combined with heart failure in 
the ICU, which could be a valid and useful clinical tool for clinicians for 
targeted treatment and prognosis prediction.

BACKGROUND: To construct and validate a risk assessment model for acute kidney 
injury (AKI) in patients with acute pancreatitis (AP) in the intensive care unit 
(ICU).
METHODS: A total of 963 patients diagnosed with acute pancreatitis (AP) from the 
Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care IV (MIMIC-IV) database was included. 
These patients were randomly divided into training set (N = 674) and validation 
set (N = 289) at a ratio of 7:3. Clinical characteristics were utilized to 
establish a nomogram for the prediction of AKI during ICU stay. These variables 
were selected by the least absolute shrinkage and selection operation (LASSO) 
regression and included in multivariate logistic regression analysis. Variables 
with P-values less than 0.05 were included in the final model. A nomogram was 
constructed based on the final model. The predicted accuracy of the nomogram was 
assessed by calculating the receiver operating characteristic curve (ROC) and 
the area under the curve (AUC). Moreover, calibration curves and Hosmer-Lemeshow 
goodness-of-fit test (HL test) were performed to evaluate model performance. 
Decision curve analysis (DCA) evaluated the clinical net benefit of the model.
RESULTS: A multivariable model that included 6 variables: weight, SOFA score, 
white blood cell count, albumin, chronic heart failure, and sepsis. The C-index 
of the nomogram was 0.82, and the area under the receiver operating 
characteristic curve (AUC) of the training set and validation set were 0.82 (95% 
confidence interval:0.79-0.86) and 0.76 (95% confidence interval: 0.70-0.82), 
respectively. Calibration plots showed good consistency between predicted and 
observed outcomes in both the training and validation sets. DCA confirmed the 
clinical value of the model and its good impact on actual decision-making.
CONCLUSION: We identified risk factors associated with the development of AKI in 
patients with AP. A risk prediction model for AKI in ICU patients with AP was 
constructed, and improving the treatment strategy of relevant factors in the 
model can reduce the risk of AKI in AP patients.

OBJECTIVE: With the aging of populations and the high prevalence of stroke, 
postoperative stroke has become a growing concern. This study aimed to establish 
a prediction model and assess the risk factors for stroke in elderly patients 
during the postoperative period.
METHODS: ML (Machine learning) prediction models were applied to elderly 
patients from the MIMIC (Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care)-III and 
MIMIC-VI databases. The SMOTENC (synthetic minority oversampling technique for 
nominal and continuous data) balancing technique and iterative SVD (Singular 
Value Decomposition) data imputation method were used to address the problem of 
category imbalance and missing values, respectively. We analyzed the possible 
predictive factors of stroke in elderly patients using seven modeling approaches 
to train the model. The diagnostic value of the model derived from machine 
learning was evaluated by the ROC curve (receiver operating characteristic 
curve).
RESULTS: We analyzed 7,128 and 661 patients from MIMIC-VI and MIMIC-III, 
respectively. The XGB (extreme gradient boosting) model got the highest AUC 
(area under the curve) of 0.78 (0.75-0.81), making it better than the other six 
models, Besides, we found that XGB model with databalancing was better than that 
without data balancing. Based on this prediction model, we found hypertension, 
cancer, congestive heart failure, chronic pulmonary disease and peripheral 
vascular disease were the top five predictors. Furthermore, we demonstrated that 
hypertension predicted postoperative stroke is much more valuable.
CONCLUSION: Stroke in elderly patients during the postoperative period can be 
reliably predicted. We proved XGB model is a reliable predictive model, and the 
history of hypertension should be weighted more heavily than the results of 
laboratory tests to prevent postoperative stroke in elderly patients regardless 
of gender.

BACKGROUND: Cardiac arrest (CA) is a common event in the intensive care unit 
(ICU), which seriously threatens the prognosis of patients. Therefore, it is 
crucial to determine a simple and effective clinical indicator to judge the 
prognosis of patients after a CA for later treatments. The purpose of this study 
was to investigate the relationship between the lactate dehydrogenase to albumin 
ratio (LAR) and the prognosis of patients after a CA.
METHODS: The clinical data of participants was obtained from the Medical 
Information Mart for Intensive Care IV (MIMIC-IV, v2.0; 2008 to 2019). According 
to the 30-day prognosis, patients were divided into a survivors group (n = 216) 
and a non-survivors group (n = 304). The optimal LAR threshold was determined 
using restricted cubic spline (RCS), which divided patients into a high LAR 
group (  ≥  15.50, n = 257) and a low LAR group (  <  15.50, n = 263). The ICU 
hospitalization and 30-day accumulative survival curves of the two groups were 
plotted following the Kaplan-Meier survival analysis. Multivariate Cox 
regression was used to analyze the relationship between the LAR and the 
prognosis of CA patients. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves were 
drawn to evaluate the predictive efficacy of the LAR on 30-day all-cause 
mortality, and sensitivity analysis was used to check the reliability of the 
findings.
RESULTS: A total of 520 patients with CA were enrolled and the 30-day mortality 
was 58.46%. The LAR in the non-survivors group was higher than in the survivors 
group. The RCS showed a linear trend relationship between the LAR and the 
mortality risk in patients during their ICU stay and 30 days; moreover, as the 
LAR increased, so did the risk of mortality. The Kaplan-Meier survival curve 
showed that compared with the low LAR group, the cumulative survival rates of 
ICU hospitalization and 30 days were lower in the high LAR group among CA 
patients (p  <  0.001). Multivariate Cox regression analysis showed that an 
elevated LAR (  ≥  15.50) was an independent risk factor for mortality during 
ICU stay and 30 days (p  <  0.005). ROC analysis suggested that the LAR was 
superior to the sequential organ failure assessment (SOFA) score in predicting 
the 30-day all-cause mortality in CA patients (area under the curve (AUC) = 
0.676, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.629-0.723). To verify the reliability of 
our findings, we performed sensitivity analyses and found that the findings were 
reliable.
CONCLUSIONS: An elevated LAR might be a predictor of mortality in patients 
following a CA during ICU hospitalization and 30 days, thereby it can be used to 
provide a reference for the clinical management of these patients.

BACKGROUND: The present study aimed to evaluate the synergistic impact of acute 
heart failure (AHF) and acute kidney injury (AKI) on in-hospital mortality in 
critically ill patients with sepsis.
METHODS: We undertook a retrospective, observational analysis using data 
acquired from the Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care-IV (MIMIC-IV) 
database and eICU Collaborative Research Database (eICU-CRD). The effects of AKI 
and AHF on in-hospital mortality were examined using a Cox proportional hazards 
model. Additive interactions were analyzed using the relative extra risk 
attributable to interaction.
RESULTS: A total of 33,184 patients were eventually included, comprising 20,626 
patients in the training cohort collected from the MIMIC-IV database and 12,558 
patients in the validation cohort extracted from the eICU-CRD database. After 
multivariate Cox analysis, the independent variables for in-hospital mortality 
included: AHF only (HR:1.20, 95% CI:1.02-1.41, P = 0.005), AKI only (HR:2.10, 
95% CI:1.91-2.31, P < 0.001), and both AHF and AKI (HR:3.80, 95%CI:13.40-4.24, P 
< 0.001). The relative excess risk owing to interaction was 1.49 (95% 
CI:1.14-1.87), the attributable percentage due to interaction was 0.39 
(95%CI:0.31-0.46), and the synergy index was 2.15 (95%CI:1.75-2.63), 
demonstrated AHF and AKI had a strong synergic impact on in-hospital mortality. 
And the findings in the validation cohort indicated identical conclusions to the 
training cohort.
CONCLUSION: Our data demonstrated a synergistic relationship of AHF and AKI on 
in-hospital mortality in critically unwell patients with sepsis.

OBJECTIVE: To develop a nomogram for predicting occurrence of secondary 
pulmonary infection in patients with critically traumatic brain injury (TBI) 
during their stay in the intensive care unit, to further optimise personalised 
treatment for patients and support the development of effective, evidence-based 
prevention and intervention strategies.
DATA SOURCE: This study used patient data from the publicly available MIMIC-IV 
(Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care IV) database.
DESIGN: A population-based retrospective cohort study.
METHODS: In this retrospective cohort study, 1780 patients with TBI were 
included and randomly divided into a training set (n=1246) and a development set 
(n=534). The impact of pulmonary infection on survival was analysed using 
Kaplan-Meier curves. A univariate logistic regression model was built in 
training set to identify potential factors for pulmonary infection, and 
independent risk factors were determined in a multivariate logistic regression 
model to build nomogram model. Nomogram performance was assessed with receiver 
operating characteristic (ROC) curves, calibration curves and Hosmer-Lemeshow 
test, and predictive value was assessed by decision curve analysis (DCA).
RESULT: This study included a total of 1780 patients with TBI, of which 186 
patients (approximately 10%) developed secondary lung infections, and 21 
patients died during hospitalisation. Among the 1594 patients who did not 
develop lung infections, only 85 patients died (accounting for 5.3%). The 
survival curves indicated a significant survival disadvantage for patients with 
TBI with pulmonary infection at 7 and 14 days after intensive care unit 
admission (p<0.001). Both univariate and multivariate logistic regression 
analyses showed that factors such as race other than white or black, respiratory 
rate, temperature, mechanical ventilation, antibiotics and congestive heart 
failure were independent risk factors for pulmonary infection in patients with 
TBI (OR>1, p<0.05). Based on these factors, along with Glasgow Coma Scale and 
international normalised ratio variables, a training set model was constructed 
to predict the risk of pulmonary infection in patients with TBI, with an area 
under the ROC curve of 0.800 in the training set and 0.768 in the validation 
set. The calibration curve demonstrated the model's good calibration and 
consistency with actual observations, while DCA indicated the practical utility 
of the predictive model in clinical practice.
CONCLUSION: This study established a predictive model for pulmonary infections 
in patients with TBI, which may help clinical doctors identify high-risk 
patients early and prevent occurrence of pulmonary infections.

This retrospective cohort study aimed to evaluate the association between 
pre-existing heart failure and both mortality and the recurrence of sepsis. A 
total of 16,092 sepsis patients without a history of heart failure and 841 
sepsis patients with pre-existing heart failure were identified from the Medical 
Information Mart for Intensive Care version IV (MIMIC-IV ) database. All 
patients were adults admitted to intensive care units, and no specific 
interventions were applied. After matching, Kaplan-Meier survival analysis 
showed significantly poorer long-term survival rates in patients with heart 
failure, both in the original (p < 0.0001) and the matched cohort (p = 0.00059). 
Mortality rates were tracked over different time periods, revealing that the 
mortality disparity became evident after the first year (p = 0.029). Besides, 
the cumulative incidence of sepsis recurrence was substantially higher in 
patients with a history of heart failure (p < 0.001) when deaths without 
recurrence were treated as competing events. Moreover, there was no 
statistically significant difference observed in the deaths without recurrence 
between the two groups (p = 0.251). In conclusion, pre-existing heart failure is 
associated with an increased risk of long-term mortality, which may be partly 
explained by a higher incidence of recurrent sepsis in this population.

Background: Cardiac surgery-associated acute kidney injury (CSA-AKI) is a common 
and serious complication after cardiac surgery. The influence of statin use 
before surgery on the renal outcome of patients undergoing cardiac surgery is 
controversial. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the effect of statins 
on postoperative renal outcomes in patients undergoing cardiac surgery. Methods: 
We included CSA-AKI patients in the Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care 
(MIMIC)-IV database and were divided into statin group and non-statin group 
according to whether they used statins before entering intensive care units 
(ICU). The main outcomes were hospitalization and 30-day mortality, and the 
secondary outcomes were 60-day mortality and 90-day mortality. We used 
propensity score matching (PSM) to adjust for confounding factors. The 95% 
confidence interval (CI) and risk ratio (RO) were calculated by the COX 
proportional regression model. At the same time, stratified analysis was used to 
explore whether the relationship between the statins use before intensive care 
units and mortality was different in each subgroup and whether the relationship 
between different doses of Atorvastatin and mortality was different. Result: We 
identified 675 pre-ICU statin users and 2095 non-statin users. In the COX 
proportional regression model, pre-ICU statin use was associated with decreased 
in-hospital (HR = 0.407, 95%confidence interval 0.278-0.595, p < 0.001) and 
30-day mortality (HR = 0.407, 95%CI 0.279-0.595, p < 0.001). The survival rate 
of patients who took statins before entering ICU was significantly higher than 
that of those who did not use statins at 30 days, 60 days and 90 days. There is 
a significant interaction between patients with aged>65 years (HR = 0.373, 95%CI 
0.240-0.581, p < 0.001), Acute kidney injury grade I (HR = 0.244, 95%CI 
0.118-0.428, p < 0.001), and without post-myocardial infarction syndrome (HR = 
0.344, 95%CI 0.218-0.542, p < 0.001). The mortality in hospital and 60 days of 
CSA-AKI patients treated with ≥80 mg Atorvastatin before operation was 
significantly reduced (p < 0.05). Conclusion: The pre-ICU statin use was 
significantly associated with decreased risk in hospital and 30-day mortality. 
The preoperative use of ≥80 mg Atorvastatin may improve the prognosis of 
CSA-AKI.

BACKGROUND: The mortality rate of sepsis-associated liver injury (SALI) is 
relatively high, but there is currently no authoritative prognostic criterion 
for the outcome of SALI. Meanwhile, lactate-to-albumin ratio (LAR) has been 
confirmed to be associated with mortality rates in conditions such as sepsis, 
heart failure, and respiratory failure. However, there is a scarcity of research 
reporting on the association between LAR and SALI. This study aimed to elucidate 
the association between LAR and the 28-day mortality rate of SALI.
METHODS: In this retrospective cohort study, data were obtained from the Medical 
Information Mart for Intensive Care IV (v2.2). Adult patients with SALI were 
admitted to the intensive care unit in this study. The LAR level at admission 
was included, and the primary aim was to assess the relationship between the LAR 
and 28-day all-cause mortality.
RESULTS: A total of 341 patients with SALI (SALI) were screened. They were 
divided into a survival group (241) and a non-survival group (100), and the 
28-day mortality rate was 29.3%. Multivariable Cox regression analysis revealed 
that for every 1-unit increase in LAR, the 28-day mortality risk for SALI 
patients increased by 21%, with an HR of 1.21 (95% CI 1.11 ~ 1.31, p < 0.001).
CONCLUSIONS: This study indicates that in patients with SALI, a higher LAR is 
associated with an increased risk of all-cause mortality within 28 days of 
admission. This suggests that LAR may serve as an independent risk factor for 
adverse outcomes in SALI patients.

BACKGROUND: Cardiogenic shock (CS) is a severe cardiac disorder with a high 
mortality rate. The triglyceride-glucose (TyG) index, a biomarker of insulin 
resistance, is associated with cardiovascular disease-related mortality. This 
study aimed to investigate the association between the TyG index and mortality 
in patients with CS.
METHODS: This retrospective cohort study analyzed 727 patients with CS from the 
Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care IV database. The TyG index was 
calculated as follows: ln[triglycerides (mg/dL) × fasting blood glucose 
(mg/dL)/2]. Outcomes included 28-day intensive care unit (ICU) mortality and 
28-day in-hospital mortality. Kaplan-Meier survival curve models and Cox 
proportional hazards regression models were used to evaluate the prognostic 
significance of the TyG index. Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) curve 
analysis was used to determine the predictive efficacy of the TyG index for 
mortality. Subgroup analyses were conducted to determine the association between 
the TyG index and mortality across different groups.
RESULTS: Non-survivors had a significantly higher TyG index (ICU: 9.30 vs. 9.13, 
p = 0.008; in-hospital: 9.29 vs. 9.13, p = 0.004). Adjusted Cox models showed 
that each 1-unit increase in the TyG index increased ICU mortality risk by 24% 
(hazard ratio [HR] = 1.24, 95% confidence interval [CI]:1.04-1.48; p = 0.015) 
and in-hospital mortality by 44% (HR = 1.44, 95% CI:1.11-1.88; p = 0.007). The 
Quartile 4 TyG index ICU mortality was increased by 77% (HR = 1.77, 95% 
CI:1.09-2.89) compared to that for Quartile 1 and in-hospital mortality was 
increased by 61% (HR = 1.61, 95% CI:1.08-2.38). The area under the ROC curve 
(AUROC) showed a modest standalone predictive ability of 0.56, but when combined 
with clinical variables, the AUROC improved to 0.80 (ICU) and 0.78 
(in-hospital). Subgroup analyses identified stronger associations in 
patients ≥ 60 years, females, non-septic, and those with acute myocardial 
infarction or heart failure.
CONCLUSIONS: The TyG index is significantly associated with short-term mortality 
in patients with CS and may serve as a useful biomarker for risk stratification.

BACKGROUND: Eosinophils are pro-inflammatory cells involved in thrombosis and 
have been proposed as a prognosis marker in acute ischemic stroke and 
ST-elevation myocardial Infarction. Here, we sought to clarify the prognostic 
value of eosinophil percentage (EOS%) in patients with acute type A aortic 
dissection (AAAD).
METHODS: We examined 183 consecutive AAAD patients. Based on the optimum cut-off 
value of EOS% determined by X-tile software, patients were classified into the 
low EOS% (EOS% ≤ 0.1) and high EOS% groups (EOS% > 0.1). We performed 
multivariate regression analysis and Kaplan-Meier (KM) survival curves to assess 
the association between EOS% and mortality. Eosinophil accumulation in aortic 
dissection intraluminal thrombus was confirmed using hematoxylin-eosin (H&E) 
staining. An external cohort from Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care IV 
was performed to validate the results.
RESULTS: Relative to surviving patients, those who died during hospitalization 
had significantly lower EOS% (p = 0.001) but significantly higher WBC 
(p = 0.002) and neutrophil (p = 0.001) counts. Multivariate regression analysis 
identified EOS% as an independent predictor of in-hospital and 1-year mortality. 
KM curves revealed that 1-year cumulative mortality was significantly higher in 
the low EOS% group, although it was mainly attributed to the higher 30-day 
mortality. H&E staining revealed massive infiltration of eosinophils in all 20 
thrombus specimens. The external validation confirmed that relative to 
survivors, patients with in-hospital mortality (p = 0.010) had significantly 
lower EOS%. Moreover, multivariate regression analyses identified that decreased 
EOS% was independently significantly associated with in-hospital mortality.
CONCLUSIONS: Low EOS% is significantly related to increased mortality rates in 
AAAD patients.

Previous studies have shown an independent association between increased red 
cell distribution width (RDW) and mortality after acute myocardial infarction 
(AMI). However, evidence regarding the predictive significance of repeated 
measures of RDW in patients with AMI remains scarce. We aimed to investigate the 
association between the dynamic profile of RDW and in-hospital mortality in 
patients with AMI.This was a cross-sectional study. We extracted clinical data 
from the Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care IIIV1.4 database. 
Demographic data, vital signs, laboratory test data, and comorbidities were 
collected from the database. The clinical endpoint was in-hospital mortality. 
Cox proportional hazards models were used to evaluate the prognostic values of 
basic RDW, and the Kaplan-Meier method was used to plot survival curves. 
Subgroup analyses were performed to measure mortality across various subgroups. 
The repeated-measures data were compared using a generalized additive mixed 
model.In total, 3101eligible patients were included. In multivariate analysis, 
adjusted for age, sex, and ethnicity, RDW was a significant risk predictor of 
in-hospital mortality. Furthermore, after adjusting for more confounding 
factors, RDW remained a significant predictor of in-hospital mortality (tertile 
3 vs tertile 1: hazard ratio 2.3; 95% confidence interval 1.39-4.01; P for trend 
<.05). The Kaplan-Meier curve for tertiles of RDW indicated that survival rates 
were highest when RDW was ≤13.2% and lowest when RDW was ≥14.2% after adjustment 
for age, sex, and ethnicity. During the intensive care unit stay, the RDW of 
nonsurvivors progressively increased until death occurred.Our findings showed

BACKGROUND: We aimed to explore the impact of aspirin use on the risk of 
readmission and mortality in patients with myocardial infarction and pneumonia.
METHODS: This was a cohort study including 703 participants with severe 
pneumonia and myocardial infarction included in the Medical Information Mart for 
Intensive Care (MIMIC)-III and the MIMIC-IV. Kaplan-Meier survival analysis was 
used to show the readmission and survival probability of patients with or 
without aspirin. In addition, univariate and multivariable models were used to 
investigate the impact of aspirin on the risk of readmission or mortality of 
patients. Subgroup analyses were conducted in terms of age, gender, antibiotic 
use, vancomycin and ampicillin use.
RESULTS: Average follow-up was one year, 22% of patients experienced 
readmission, and 72% patients survived. After the confounders were adjusted for, 
a 0.46-fold decreased risk of readmission (hazard ratio [HR]=0.46, 95% 
confidence interval [CI]: 0.27-0.78) and a 0.58-fold decreased risk of one-year 
mortality (HR=0.56, 95%CI: 0.42-0.82) were observed favoring aspirin use. 
Subgroup analyses revealed that aspirin was, however, associated with an 
increased risk of mortality in patients not receiving vancomycin treatment 
(HR=1.79, 95%CI: 1.08-2.97).
CONCLUSIONS: Our findings suggest that clinicians should consider using aspirin 
in patients with severe myocardial infarction and pneumonia was recommended.

BACKGROUND: Machine learning (ML) has been used to build high performance 
prediction model. Patients with congestive heart failure (CHF) are vulnerable to 
acute kidney injury (AKI) which makes treatment difficult. We aimed to establish 
an ML-based prediction model for the early identification of AKI in patients 
with CHF.
METHODS: Patients data were extracted from the Medical Information Mart for 
Intensive Care III (MIMIC-III) database, and patients with CHF were selected. 
Comparisons between several common ML classifiers were conducted to select the 
best prediction model. Recursive feature elimination (RFE) was used to select 
important prediction features. The model was improved using hyperparameters 
optimization (HPO). The final model was validated using an external validation 
set from the eICU Collaborative Research Database. The area under the receiver 
operating characteristic curve (AUROC), accuracy, calibration curve and decision 
curve analysis were used to evaluate prediction performance. Additionally, the 
final model was used to predict renal replacement therapy (RRT) requirement and 
to assess the short-term prognosis of patients with CHF. Finally, a software 
program was developed based on the selected features, which could intuitively 
report the probability of AKI.
RESULTS: A total of 8,580 patients with CHF were included, among whom 2,364 were 
diagnosed with AKI. The LightGBM model showed the best prediction performance 
(AUROC = 0.803) among the 13 ML-based models. After RFE and HPO, the final model 
was established with 18 features including serum creatinine (SCr), blood urea 
nitrogen (BUN) and urine output (UO). The prediction performance of LightGBM was 
better than that of measuring SCr, UO or SCr combined with UO (AUROCs: 0.809, 
0.703, 0.560 and 0.714, respectively). Additionally, the final model could 
accurately predict RRT requirement in patients with (AUROC = 0.954). Moreover, 
the participants were divided into high- and low-risk groups for AKI, and the 
90-day mortality in the high-risk group was significantly higher than that in 
the low-risk group (log-rank p < 0.001). Finally, external validation using the 
eICU database comprising 9,749 patients with CHF revealed satisfactory 
prediction outcomes (AUROC = 0.816).
CONCLUSION: A prediction model for AKI in patients with CHF was established 
based on LightGBM, and the prediction performance of this model was better than 
that of other models. This model may help in predicting RRT requirement and in 
identifying the population with poor prognosis among patients with CHF.

BACKGROUND: The optimal parameters for defining stages of cardiogenic shock (CS) 
are not yet known. The Cardiogenic Shock Working Group-defined Society for 
Cardiovascular Angiography and Interventions (CSWG-SCAI) staging of CS was 
developed to provide simple and specific parameters for risk-stratifying 
patients.
OBJECTIVES: The purpose of this study was to test whether the Cardiogenic Shock 
Working Group-defined Society for Cardiovascular Angiography and Interventions 
(CSWG-SCAI) staging is associated with in-hospital mortality, using the Medical 
Information Mart for Intensive Care IV (MIMIC-IV) database.
METHODS: We utilized the open-access MIMIC-IV database, which includes >300,000 
patients admitted between 2008 and 2019. We extracted the clinical profile of 
patients admitted with CS and stratified them into different SCAI stages at 
admission based on the CSWG criteria. We then tested the association between 
in-hospital mortality and parameters of hypotension, hypoperfusion, and overall 
CSWG-SCAI stage.
RESULTS: Of the 2463 patients, CS was predominantly caused by heart failure (HF; 
54.7 %) or myocardial infarction (MI; 26.3 %). Mortality was 37.5 % for the 
total cohort, 32.7 % for patients with HF, and 40 % for patients with MI 
(p < 0.001). Mortality was higher among patients with mean arterial 
pressure < 65 mmHg, lactate >2 mmol/L, ALT >200 IU/L, pH ≤ 7.2, and more than 
one drug/device support at baseline. Increasing CSWG-SCAI stages at baseline and 
maximum CSWG-SCAI stage achieved were significantly associated with in-hospital 
mortality (p < 0.05).
CONCLUSIONS: The CSWG-SCAI stages are significantly associated with in-hospital 
mortality and may be used to identify hospitalized patients at risk of worsening 
cardiogenic shock severity.
CONDENSED ABSTRACT: We analyzed data from 2463 patients with cardiogenic shock 
using the MIMIC-IV database to investigate the relationship between the 
Cardiogenic Shock Working Group-defined Society for Cardiovascular Angiography 
and Interventions (CSWG-SCAI) staging and in-hospital mortality. The main causes 
of cardiogenic shock were heart failure (54.7 %) and myocardial infarction 
(26.3 %). The overall mortality rate was 37.5 %, with a higher rate among 
patients with myocardial infarction (40 %) compared to those with heart failure 
(32.7 %). Mean arterial pressure < 65 mmHg, lactate >2 mmol/L, ALT >200 IU/L, 
and pH ≤ 7.2 were significantly associated with mortality. Increasing CSWG-SCAI 
stages at baseline and maximum achieved stages were strongly associated with 
higher mortality (p < 0.05). Therefore, the CSWG-SCAI staging system can be used 
to risk-stratify patients with cardiogenic shock.

BACKGROUND: Heart failure (HF) is a leading cause of mortality and morbidity 
worldwide, with an increasing incidence. Invasive ventilation is considered to 
be essential for patients with HF. Previous studies have shown that driving 
pressure is associated with mortality in acute respiratory distress syndrome 
(ARDS). However, the relationship between driving pressure and mortality has not 
yet been examined in ventilated patients with HF. We assessed the association of 
driving pressure and mortality in patients with HF.
METHODS: We conducted a retrospective cohort study of invasive ventilated adult 
patients with HF from the Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care-III 
database. We used multivariable logistic regression models, a generalized 
additive model, and a two-piecewise linear regression model to show the effect 
of the average driving pressure within 24 h of intensive care unit admission on 
in-hospital mortality.
RESULTS: Six hundred and thirty-two invasive ventilated patients with HF were 
enrolled. Driving pressure was independently associated with in-hospital 
mortality (odds ratio [OR], 1.12; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.06-1.18; P < 
0.001) after adjusted potential confounders. A nonlinear relationship was found 
between driving pressure and in-hospital mortality, which had a threshold around 
14.27 cmH2O. The effect sizes and CIs below and above the threshold were 0.89 
(0.75 to 1.05) and 1.17 (1.07 to 1.30), respectively.
CONCLUSIONS: There was a nonlinear relationship between driving pressure and 
mortality in patients with HF who were ventilated for more than 48 h, and this 
relationship was associated with increased in-hospital mortality when the 
driving pressure was more than 14.27 cmH2O.

OBJECTIVE: To investigate the prescription rate of short-term systemic use of 
glucocorticoids during hospitalization in patients with cardiogenic shock (CS), 
and outcomes related with glucocorticoid use.
METHODS: We extracted patients' information from the Medical Information Mart 
for Intensive Care IV version 2.0 (MIMIC-IV v2.0) database. The primary endpoint 
was 90-day all-cause mortality. Secondary safety endpoints were infection 
identified by bacterial culture and at least one episode of hyperglycemia after 
ICU admission. Propensity score matching (PSM) was used to balance baseline 
characteristics. The difference in cumulative mortality rate between these 
treated with and without glucocorticoids was assessed by Kaplan-Meier curve with 
log-rank test. Independent risk factors for endpoints were identified by Cox or 
Logistic regression analysis.
RESULTS: A total of 1528 patients were enrolled, and one-sixth of these patients 
received short-term systemic therapy of glucocorticoids during hospitalization. 
These conditions, including rapid heart rate, the presence of rheumatic disease, 
chronic pulmonary disease and septic shock, high lactate level, the requirements 
of mechanical ventilation and continuous renal replacement therapy, were 
associated with an increase in glucocorticoid administration (all P ≤ 0.024). 
During a follow-up of 90 days, the cumulative mortality rate in patients treated 
with glucocorticoids was significantly higher than that in these untreated with 
glucocorticoids (log-rank test, P < 0.001). Multivariable Cox regression 
analysis showed that glucocorticoid use (hazard ratio 1.48, 95% confidence 
interval [CI] 1.22-1.81; P < 0.001) was independently associated with an 
increased risk for 90-day all-cause mortality. This result was consistent 
irrespective of age, gender, the presence of myocardial infarction, acute 
decompensated heart failure and septic shock, and inotrope therapy, but was more 
evident in low-risk patients as assessed by ICU scoring systems. Additionally, 
multivariable Logistic regression analysis showed that glucocorticoid exposure 
was an independent predictor of hyperglycemia (odds ratio 2.14, 95% CI 
1.48-3.10; P < 0.001), but not infection (odds ratio 1.23, 95% CI 0.88-1.73; 
P = 0.221). After PSM, glucocorticoid therapy was also significantly related 
with increased risks of 90-day mortality and hyperglycemia.
CONCLUSIONS: Real-world data showed that short-term systemic use of 
glucocorticoids was common in CS patients. Importantly, these prescriptions were 
associated with increased risks of adverse events.

OBJECTIVE: This study aims to construct and validate several machine learning 
(ML) algorithms to predict long-term mortality and identify risk factors in 
unselected patients post-cardiac surgery.
METHODS: The Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care (MIMIC-III) database 
was used to perform a retrospective administrative database study. Candidate 
predictors consisted of the demographics, comorbidity, vital signs, laboratory 
test results, scoring systems, and treatment information on the first day of ICU 
admission. Four-year mortality was set as the study outcome. We used the ML 
methods of logistic regression (LR), artificial neural network (NNET), naïve 
bayes (NB), gradient boosting machine (GBM), adapting boosting (Ada), random 
forest (RF), bagged trees (BT), and eXtreme Gradient Boosting (XGB). The 
prognostic capacity and clinical utility of these ML models were compared using 
the area under the receiver operating characteristic curves (AUC), calibration 
curves, and decision curve analysis (DCA).
RESULTS: Of 7,368 patients in MIMIC-III included in the final cohort, a total of 
1,337 (18.15%) patients died during a 4-year follow-up. Among 65 variables 
extracted from the database, a total of 25 predictors were selected using 
recursive feature elimination and included in the subsequent analysis. The Ada 
model performed best among eight models in both discriminatory ability with the 
highest AUC of 0.801 and goodness of fit (visualized by calibration curve). 
Moreover, the DCA shows that the net benefit of the RF, Ada, and BT models 
surpassed that of other ML models for almost all threshold probability values. 
Additionally, through the Ada technique, we determined that red blood cell 
distribution width (RDW), blood urea nitrogen (BUN), SAPS II, anion gap (AG), 
age, urine output, chloride, creatinine, congestive heart failure, and SOFA were 
the Top 10 predictors in the feature importance rankings.
CONCLUSIONS: The Ada model performs best in predicting 4-year mortality after 
cardiac surgery among the eight ML models, which might have significant 
application in the development of early warning systems for patients following 
operations.

OBJECTIVE: The effectiveness of antithrombotic drugs for treating sepsis is 
controversial. Here, we explore the association between antithrombotic therapy 
and intensive care unit (ICU) mortality for septic patients with peripheral 
vascular disease.
METHODS: This retrospective cohort study uses data from the Medical Information 
Mart for Intensive Care (MIMIC)-III database. Kaplan-Meier survival analyses 
were used to examine mortality among different groups. Cox regression and 
marginal structural Cox models (MSCMs) were used to adjust for confounding 
factors. Main Results. The final cohort from the MIMIC-III database included 776 
patients, of which 701 survived and 75 perished. The anticoagulant (AC) group 
and the antiplatelet-anticoagulation (AC-AP) group survived better than the 
group without antithrombotic treatment (non-AT). The AC and AC-AP groups showed 
a 0.363-fold and 0.373-fold risk of ICU mortality, respectively, compared with 
the non-AT group when controlling for age, gender, CRRT, alcohol, heart failure, 
hypertension, diabetes, obesity, renal failure, liver disease, INR, PT, PPT, and 
SpO2. Antiplatelet therapy did not reduce ICU mortality. The same trends were 
apparent from the MSCM. In addition, the AC-AP group exhibited a lower risk of 
bleeding complications.
CONCLUSION: Although the antithrombotic group (AC and AC-AP groups) demonstrated 
a higher sequential organ failure assessment (SOFA) score than the group without 
antithrombotic treatment (non-AT group), the risk of ICU mortality was lower 
without increasing the risk of bleeding complications. Our study further 
suggested that anticoagulation therapy may benefit the prognosis of septic 
patients with peripheral vascular disease.

BACKGROUND: Malnutrition is common in patients with acute myocardial infarction 
(AMI) and is associated with a poor prognosis. The prognostic value of the 
prognostic nutritional index (PNI) in patients with AMI remains controversial. 
We aimed to explore the relationship between PNI and all-cause mortality in 
critically ill patients with AMI and evaluate the incremental prognostic value 
of PNI to commonly used prognostic assessment tools.
METHODS: The Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care-IV (MIMIC-IV) database 
was used to conduct a retrospective cohort analysis on 1180 critically ill 
patients with AMI. The primary endpoints were defined as 6-month and 1-year 
all-cause mortality. Cox regression analysis was used to investigate the 
relationship between admission PNI and all-cause mortality. The effect of adding 
PNI to sequential organ failure assessment (SOFA) score, or charlson comorbidity 
index (CCI) on its discriminative ability was assessed using C-statistic, net 
reclassification improvement (NRI), and integrated discrimination improvement 
(IDI).
RESULTS: Multivariate cox regression analysis demonstrated that the low PNI was 
regarded as an independent predictor of 1-year all-cause mortality in AMI 
patients admitted to ICU (adjusted Hazard Ratio: 95% CI = 1.75 (1.22-2.49)). The 
ROC test showed that admission PNI had a moderate predictive ability to predict 
all-cause mortality of critically ill patients with AMI. Furthermore, the net 
reclassification and integrated discrimination of the CCI alone model improved 
significantly with PNI. [C-statistic increased from 0.669 to 0.752, p < 0.001; 
NRI = 0.698, p < 0.001; IDI = 0.073, p < 0.001]. When PNI was added to the SOFA 
score, the C-statistic significantly improved from 0.770 to 0.805 (p < 0.001), 
and the NRI and IDI were estimated at 0.573 (p < 0.001) and 0.041 (p < 0.001), 
respectively.
CONCLUSION: PNI could be a novel predictor for identifying patients at high risk 
of 1-year all-cause mortality in critically ill patients with AMI. The addition 
of PNI to the SOFA score or CCI may be useful for very early risk 
stratification.

PURPOSE: Cardiac arrest (CA) is the most serious death-related event in 
critically ill patients and the early detection of CA is beneficial to reduce 
mortality according to clinical research. This study aims to develop and verify 
a real-time, interpretable machine learning model, namely cardiac arrest 
prediction index (CAPI), to predict CA of critically ill patients based on 
bedside vital signs monitoring.
METHODS: A total of 1,860 patients were analyzed retrospectively from the 
Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care III (MIMIC-III) database. Based on 
vital signs, we extracted a total of 43 features for building machine learning 
model. Extreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost) was used to develop a real-time 
prediction model. Three-fold cross validation determined the consistency of 
model accuracy. SHAP value was used to capture the overall and real-time 
interpretability of the model.
RESULTS: On the test set, CAPI predicted 95% of CA events, 80% of which were 
identified more than 25 min in advance, resulting in an area under the receiver 
operating characteristic curve (AUROC) of 0.94. The sensitivity, specificity, 
area under the precision-recall curve (AUPRC) and F1-score were 0.86, 0.85, 0.12 
and 0.05, respectively.
CONCLUSION: CAPI can help predict patients with CA in the vital signs monitoring 
at bedside. Compared with previous studies, CAPI can give more timely 
notifications to doctors for CA events. However, current performance was at the 
cost of alarm fatigue. Future research is still needed to achieve better 
clinical application.

BACKGROUND: Red blood cell distribution width (RDW) and albumin level were 
considered to be related to the prognosis of patients with acute myocardial 
infarction (AMI). This study aims to investigate the correlation between RAR and 
90-day mortality in AMI patients.
METHODS: Data of AMI patients were obtained from the Medical Information Mart 
for Intensive Care III (MIMIC-III) database. According to the median, RAR < 4.32 
was regarded as low RAR level group, and RAR ≥ 4.32 as high RAR level group; low 
RDW level group was defined as < 14.00%, and high RDW level group as ≥ 14.00%; 
albumin < 3.30 g/dL was low level group, and albumin ≥ 3.30 g/dL as high level 
group. The outcome was the mortality rate within 90 days after admission to ICU. 
Univariate and multivariate Cox models were performed to determine the 
relationship between RAR and 90-day mortality in AMI patients with hazard ratio 
(HR) and 95% confidence interval (CI). Stratification analyses were conducted to 
explore the effect of RAR on 90-day mortality in different subgroups of age, 
gender, simplified acute physiology score II (SAPS II), elixhauser comorbidity 
index (ECI) score, treatment modalities and white blood cell.
RESULTS: Of the total 2081 AMI patients, 543 (26.09%) died within 90-day 
follow-up duration. The results showed that high RAR (HR = 1.65, 95% CI 
1.34-2.03) and high RDW levels (HR = 1.31, 95% CI 1.08-1.61) were associated 
with an increased risk of death in AMI patients, and that high albumin level was 
related to a decreased risk of death (HR = 0.77, 95%CI 0.64-0.93). The 
relationship of RAR level and the mortality of AMI patients was also observed in 
the subgroup analysis. Additionally, the finding indicated that RAR might be a 
more effective biomarker for predicting 90-day mortality of AMI patients than 
albumin, RDW.
CONCLUSION: RAR may be a potential marker for the prognostic assessment of AMI, 
and a high RAR level was correlated with increased risk of 90-day mortality of 
AMI patients.

Our study focused on evaluating the effect of three common vasoactive drugs on 
the prognosis of elderly patients with sepsis and pre-existing heart failure. 
The Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care III database, Version 1.4, was 
used. Our study included critically ill older patients (aged ≥ 65 years) with 
sepsis and heart failure treated with vasoactive drugs. Patients were divided 
into norepinephrine group, norepinephrine combined with vasopressin group, and 
dopamine group. The baseline characteristics, primary outcome, and secondary 
outcome measures were compared among the three groups. In total, 1357 elderly 
patients were included (766 in norepinephrine group, 250 in norepinephrine 
combined with vasopressin group, and 341 in dopamine group). After propensity 
score matching, statistically significant differences in 28-d and 90-d mortality 
(P = 0.046, P = 0.031) were observed; meanwhile, there was a significant 
difference in the incidence of mechanical ventilation, AKI, and malignant 
arrhythmias. Cox regression analysis revealed that norepinephrine combined with 
vasopressin decreased 5-year survival statistically(P = 0.001). Multiple linear 
regression analysis indicated dopamine as an independent risk factor in reducing 
ICU and hospital length of stay (P = 0.001, P = 0.017). Logistic regression 
analysis showed dopamine was an independent risk factor for new-onset 
arrhythmias (P < 0.001), while norepinephrine combined with vasopressin was an 
independent risk factor for new-onset malignant arrhythmias (P < 0.001). 
Norepinephrine in combination with vasopressin decreased survival and increased 
the incidence of malignant arrhythmias in elderly sepsis patients with 
pre-existing heart failure. Dopamine alone reduces ICU and hospital length of 
stay but increases the new-onset arrhythmias.

AIMS: Acute myocardial infarction (AMI) is a cardiovascular disease with high 
morbidity and mortality. We collected patients with AMI from the Medical 
Information Mart for Intensive Care IV (v2.0) database and explored the 
association between serum albumin-corrected anion gap (ACAG) level and mortality 
in patients with AMI.
METHODS AND RESULTS: Data of adult patients with AMI were collected. According 
to the 360 day prognosis, patients were divided into survival and non-survival 
groups. Based on the ACAG level, patients were then divided into normal and high 
ACAG groups. Cox hazard proportional models and restricted cubic splines (RCSs) 
were used to investigate the correlation between ACAG and mortality. 
Kaplan-Meier curves were created to compare the cumulative survival rates 
between the high and normal ACAG groups. The receiver operating characteristic 
(ROC) curve was used to analyse the predictive value of ACAG for the prognosis 
of patients with AMI. Sensitivity and subgroup analyses were conducted to 
revalidate the results. Finally, 1783 patients were included. Elevated ACAG 
(>20 mmol/L) was significantly associated with 30 and 360 day mortality 
(P < 0.001). Adjusted for multiple confounding factors, the Cox proportional 
hazard analysis showed that elevated ACAG (>20 mmol/L) was an independent risk 
factor of increased all-cause mortality in patients with AMI (hazard ratio 
1.423, 95% confidence interval 1.206-1.678, P < 0.001). RCS analysis further 
showed that there was a non-linear trend relationship between ACAG and the risk 
of all-cause mortality at 30 and 360 days (χ2 = 10.750, P = 0.013; χ2 = 13.960, 
P = 0.003). Kaplan-Meier survival curves showed that the 30 and 360 day 
cumulative survival rates of patients with AMI were significantly lower 
(log-rank test, χ2 = 98.880, P < 0.001; χ2 = 105.440, P < 0.001) in the high 
ACAG group. ROC curve analysis showed that the area under the curve (AUC) of 
ACAG was 0.651, while the AUC of anion gap (AG) was 0.609, indicating that ACAG 
had a higher predictive value for 360 day mortality than AG. When combined with 
Sequential Organ Failure Assessment score, the predictive performance of ACAG 
for 360 day mortality was better, with an AUC of 0.699. Sensitivity and subgroup 
analyses were conducted suggesting the stability of our results.
CONCLUSIONS: Elevated serum ACAG (≥20 mmol/L) is an independent risk factor for 
short-term and long-term mortality in critically ill patients with AMI, and it 
may assist clinicians and nurses identifying high-risk patients.

BACKGROUND: Previous studies have shown that inflammation plays an important 
role in atherosclerosis and cardiovascular disease. Platelet to lymphocyte ratio 
(PLR) has been reported as a novel inflammatory marker. However, it is not clear 
whether PLR is associated with short-term all-cause mortality in critically ill 
patients with non-ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI).
METHODS: The data for the study is from the Medical Information Mart for 
Intensive Care III database. The primary outcome in our study was 28-day 
mortality. Kapan-Meier curve, lowess smoother curve, and multivariate Cox 
regression models were used to determine whether the association between PLR and 
28-day mortality of critically ill patients with NSTEMI.
RESULTS: A total of 1273 critically ill patients with NSTEMI were included in 
this analysis. Kapan-Meier curve and lowess smoother curve show that high PLR is 
associated with an increased risk of 28-day all-cause mortality. The study 
population is divided into two groups according to the cut-off value of PLR 
level. In the Cox model, high PLR levels (PLR≥195.8) were significantly 
associated with increased 28-day mortality (HR 1.54; 95%CI 1.09-2.18, p = .013). 
In quartile analyses, the HR (95% CI) for the third (183 ≤ PLR < 306) and fourth 
quartile (PLR≥306) was 1.55 (1.05-2.29) and 1.61 (1.03-2.52), respectively, 
compared to the reference group(111 ≤ PLR < 183). In subgroup analyses, there is 
no interaction effect in most of the subgroups except for respiratory failure 
and vasopressor use.
CONCLUSION: High PLR is associated with an increased risk of short-term 
mortality in critically ill patients with NSTEMI.

PURPOSES OF STUDY: This study aimed to elucidate the relationship between 
obesity and short-term and long-term mortality in patients with acute myocardial 
infarction (AMI) by analysing the body mass index (BMI).
STUDY DESIGN: A retrospective cohort study was performed on adult intensive care 
unit (ICU) patients with AMI in the Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care 
III database. The WHO BMI classification was used in the study. The Kaplan-Meier 
curve was used to show the likelihood of survival in patients with AMI. The 
relationships of the BMI classification with short-term and long-term mortality 
were assessed using Cox proportional hazard regression models.
RESULTS: This study included 1295 ICU patients with AMI, who were divided into 
four groups according to the WHO BMI classification. Our results suggest that 
obese patients with AMI tended to be younger (p<0.001), be men (p=0.001) and 
have higher blood glucose and creatine kinase (p<0.001) compared with normal 
weight patients. In the adjusted model, compared with normal weight AMI 
patients, those who were overweight and obese had lower ICU risks of death 
HR=0.64 (95% CI 0.46 to 0.89) and 0.55 (0.38 to 0.78), respectively, inhospital 
risks of death (0.77 (0.56 to 1.09) and 0.61 (0.43 to 0.87)) and long-term risks 
of death (0.78 0.64 to 0.94) and 0.72 (0.59 to 0.89). On the other hand, 
underweight patients had higher risks of short-term(ICU or inhospital mortality) 
and long-term mortality compared with normal weight patients (HR=1.39 (95% CI 
0.58 to 3.30), 1.46 (0.62 to 3.42) and 1.99 (1.15 to 3.44), respectively).
CONCLUSIONS: Overweight and obesity were protective factors for the short-term 
and long-term risks of death in patients with AMI.

BACKGROUND: The main purpose of this study was to explore the predictive value 
of the systemic immune inflammation index (SII), a novel clinical marker, in 
heart failure (HF) patients.
METHODS: Critically ill patients with HF were identified from the Medical 
Information Mart for Intensive Care III (MIMIC III) database. Patients were 
divided into three groups according to tertiles of SII (group 1, group 2, group 
3). We used Kaplan-Meier curves and Cox proportional hazards regression models 
to evaluate the association between the SII and all-cause mortality in HF. 
Subgroup analysis was used to verify the predictive effect of the SII on 
mortality.
RESULTS: This study included 9107 patients with a diagnosis of HF from the MIMIC 
III database. After 30, 60, 180, and 365 days of follow-up, 25.60%, 32.10%, 
41.30%, and 47.50% of the patients in group 3 had died. Using the Kaplan-Meier 
curve, we observed that patients with higher SII values had a shorter survival 
time (log rank p < 0.001). The Cox proportional hazards regression model 
adjusted for all possible confounders and indicated that the higher SII group 
had a higher mortality (30-day: HR = 1.304, 95%CI = 1.161 - 1.465, 60-day: HR = 
1.266, 95% CI = 1.120 - 1.418, 180-day: HR = 1.274, 95%CI = 1.163 - 1.395, and 
365-day: HR = 1.255, 95%CI = 1.155 - 1.364).
CONCLUSIONS: SII values could be used as a predictor of prognosis in critically 
ill patients with HF.

OBJECTIVE: The lactate/albumin ratio (LAR) has been used as a novel prognostic 
indicator for aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage, traumatic brain injury, 
sepsis, heart failure, and acute respiratory failure. However, its potential in 
predicting all-cause mortality in patients with ischemic stroke (IS) has not 
been evaluated. Therefore, this study aimed to elucidate the correlation between 
LAR and 28-day all-cause mortality in IS patients without reperfusion therapy.
METHODS: This retrospective cohort study used data from the Medical Information 
Mart for Intensive Care (MIMIC-IV) (v2.0) database. It included 568 IS adult 
patients admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU). The correlation between LAR 
and ICU 28-day all-cause mortality rate was analyzed using multiple COX 
regression analysis and Kaplan-Meier survival analysis. Restricted cubic spline 
(RCS) curves were used to assess the relationship between LAR and 28-day 
mortality. In addition, a subgroup analysis was performed to investigate the 
impact of other influencing factors on outcomes. The primary outcome was the 
ability of LAR to predict 28-day mortality in IS patients.
RESULTS: Among the 568 patients with IS, 370 survived (survival group) and 198 
died (non-survival group) within 28 days of admission (mortality rate: 34.9%). A 
multivariate COX regression analysis indicated that LAR was an independent 
predictor of all-cause mortality within 28 days after admission for patients 
with IS (hazard ratio: 1.32; 95% confidence interval: 1.03-1.68; P = 0.025). We 
constructed a model that included LAR, age, race, sex, white blood cell count, 
Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (SOFA) score, and anion gap (AG) and 
established a prediction model with an area under the curve (AUC) value of 71.5% 
(95% confidence interval: 67.1%-75.8%). The optimal cutoff value of LAR that 
separated the survival group and the non-survival group based on the Youden 
index was 0.55. The Kaplan-Meier survival curves plotted using this critical 
value showed that patients with LAR ≥ 0.55 had a significantly higher 28-day 
all-cause mortality rate than patients with LAR < 0.55 (P = 0.0083).
CONCLUSION: LAR can serve as an independent predictor of all-cause mortality 
within 28 days after admission for patients with IS.

Background: During the acute heart failure (AHF), acute kidney injury (AKI) is 
highly prevalent in critically ill patients. The occurrence of the latter 
condition increases the risk of mortality in patients with acute heart failure. 
The current research on the relationship between nutritional risk and the 
occurrence of acute kidney injury in patients with acute heart failure is very 
limited. Methods: This retrospective cohort study utilized data from the Medical 
Information Mart for Intensive Care IV (MIMIC-IV, version 2.1) database. We 
included adult patients with AHF who were admitted to the intensive care unit in 
the study. Results: A total of 1310 critically ill patients with acute heart 
failure were included. The AUC of geriatric nutritional risk index (GNRI) 
(0.694) is slightly superior to that of controlling nutritional status (CONUT) 
(0.656) and prognostic nutritional index (PNI) (0.669). The Log-rank test 
revealed a higher risk of acute kidney injury in patients with high nutritional 
risk (p < 0.001). Multivariate COX regression analysis indicated that a high 
GNRI (adjusted HR 0.62, p < 0.001) was associated with a reduced risk of AKI 
during hospitalization in AHF patients. The final subgroup analysis demonstrated 
no significant interaction of GNRI in all subgroups except for diabetes subgroup 
and ventilation subgroup (P for interaction: 0.057-0.785). Conclusion: Our study 
findings suggest a correlation between GNRI and the occurrence of acute kidney 
injury in patients hospitalized with acute heart failure.

BACKGROUND: The relationship between statin use and delirium remains 
controversial; therefore, we aimed to study the association between statin 
exposure and delirium and in-hospital mortality in patients with congestive 
heart failure.
METHODS: In this retrospective study, patients with congestive heart failure 
were identified from the Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care database. 
The primary exposure variable was statin use 3 days after admission to the 
intensive care unit, and the primary outcome measure was the presence of 
delirium. The secondary outcome measure was in-hospital mortality. Since the 
cohort study was retrospective, we used inverse probability weighting derived 
from the propensity score to balance various variables.
RESULTS: Of 8,396 patients, 5,446 (65%) were statin users. Before matching, the 
prevalence of delirium was 12.5% and that of in-hospital mortality was 11.8% in 
patients with congestive heart failure. Statin use was significantly negatively 
correlated with delirium, with an odds ratio of 0.76 (95% confidence interval: 
[0.66-0.87]; P < 0.001) in the inverse probability weighting cohort and 
in-hospital mortality of 0.66 (95% confidence interval: [0.58-0.75]; P < 0.001).
CONCLUSION: Statins administered in the intensive care unit can significantly 
reduce the incidence of delirium and in-hospital mortality in patients with 
congestive heart failure.

BACKGROUND: Predicting hospital mortality risk is essential for the care of 
heart failure patients, especially for those in intensive care units.
METHODS: Using a novel machine learning algorithm, we constructed a risk 
stratification tool that correlated patients' clinical features and in-hospital 
mortality. We used the extreme gradient boosting algorithm to generate a model 
predicting the mortality risk of heart failure patients in the intensive care 
unit in the derivation dataset of 5676 patients from the Medical Information 
Mart for Intensive Care III database. The logistic regression model and a common 
risk score for mortality were used for comparison. The eICU Collaborative 
Research Database dataset was used for external validation.
RESULTS: The performance of the machine learning model was superior to that of 
conventional risk predictive methods, with the area under curve 0.831 (95% CI 
0.820-0.843) and acceptable calibration. In external validation, the model had 
an area under the curve of 0.809 (95% CI 0.805-0.814). Risk stratification 
through the model was specific when the hospital mortality was very low, low, 
moderate, high, and very high (2.0%, 10.2%, 11.5%, 21.2% and 56.2%, 
respectively). The decision curve analysis verified that the machine learning 
model is the best clinically valuable in predicting mortality risk.
CONCLUSION: Using readily available clinical data in the intensive care unit, we 
built a machine learning-based mortality risk tool with prediction accuracy 
superior to that of linear regression model and common risk scores. The risk 
tool may support clinicians in assessing individual patients and making 
individualized treatment.

OBJECTIVE: Hip fracture is a prevalent condition with a significant death rate 
among the elderly. We sought to develop a nomogram-based survival prediction 
model for older patients with hip fracture.
DESIGN: A retrospective case-control study.
SETTING: The data from Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care III 
(MIMIC-III V.1.4).
PARTICIPANTS: The clinical features of elderly patients with hip fracture, 
including basic information, comorbidities, severity score, laboratory tests and 
therapy, were filtered out based on the MIMIC-III V.1.4.
METHODS AND MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: All patients included in the study were from 
critical care and randomly divided into training and validation sets (7:3). On 
the basis of retrieved data, the least absolute shrinkage and selection operator 
(LASSO) regression and multiple logistic regression analysis were used to 
identify independent predictive variables of 1-year mortality, and then 
constructed a risk prediction nomogram. The predictive values of the nomogram 
model were evaluated by the concordance indexes (C-indexes), receiver operating 
characteristic curve, decision curve analysis (DCA) and calibration curve.
RESULTS: A total of 341 elderly patients with hip fracture were included in this 
study; 121 cases died within 1 year. After LASSO regression and multiple 
logistic regression analysis, a novel nomogram contained the predictive 
variables of age, weight, the proportion of lymphocyte count, liver disease, 
malignant tumour and congestive heart failure. The constructed model proved 
satisfactory discrimination with C-indexes of 0.738 (95% CI 0.674 to 0.802) in 
the training set and 0.713 (95% CI 0.608 to 0.819) in the validation set. The 
calibration curve shows a good degree of fitting between the predicted and 
observed probabilities and the DCA confirms the model's clinical practicability.
CONCLUSIONS: The novel prediction model provides personalised predictions for 
1-year mortality in elderly patients with hip fractures. Compared with other hip 
fracture models, our nomogram is particularly suitable for predicting long-term 
mortality in critical patients.

Objective: The causality between cardiometabolic disease (CMD) and sepsis has 
remained largely unknown. To elucidate this, we conducted a Mendelian 
randomization (MR) and population study. Methods: First, we used univariable and 
multivariable MR analyses to investigate causal associations between CMD and 
sepsis-related outcomes. We obtained genome-wide association study summary from 
both the MRC Integrative Epidemiology Unit and the FinnGen consortium. 
Subsequently, a two-step mediation MR analysis was performed to explore 
mediators. Afterward, we conducted an observational study using the Medical 
Information Mart for Intensive Care IV database, in which multivariable logistic 
regression models were utilized to examine the relationship between CMD and 
sepsis-related outcomes. Results: In the MR study, type 2 diabetes mellitus (OR 
= 1.058, 95% CI = 1.017-1.100, P = 0.005), obesity (OR = 1.113, 95% CI = 
1.057-1.172, P < 0.001), and heart failure (HF) (OR = 1.178, 95% CI = 
1.063-1.305, P = 0.002) were independently causally related to sepsis. Obesity 
(OR = 1.215, 95% CI = 1.027-1.437, P = 0.023) and HF (OR = 1.494, 95% CI = 
1.080-2.065, P = 0.015) also showed independent causal associations with sepsis 
critical care admission. Mediation MR analysis identified 23 blood metabolites 
potentially causally linked to sepsis ( P < 0.05), yet none mediated the 
relationship between CMD and sepsis. In the observational study, we found 
associations between sepsis and several conditions including type 2 diabetes 
mellitus, obesity, hypertension, stroke, HF, and hyperlipidemia after adjusting 
for confounding factors. Moreover, hypertension, stroke, HF, coronary artery 
disease, and hyperlipidemia were linked to sepsis critical care admission. 
Conclusion: This study has, for the first time, revealed indicative evidence of 
a causal relationship between CMD and sepsis through observational and genetic 
evidence. Taken together, clinical attention to sepsis may be warranted among 
patients with CMD.

Acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) is an acute lung injury associated 
with high morbidity and mortality. This study aimed to establish an accurate 
prediction model for mortality risk in ARDS. 70% of patients from the Medical 
Information Mart for Intensive Care Database (MIMIC-III) were selected as the 
training group, and the remaining 30% as the testing group. Patients from a 
Chinese hospital were used for external validation. Univariate and multivariate 
regressions were used to screen the independent predictors. The receiver 
operating characteristic curve (ROC) analysis, the Hosmer-Lemeshow test, and the 
calibration curve were used for evaluating the performance of the model. Age, 
hemoglobin, heart failure, renal failure, Simplified Acute Physiology Score II 
(SAPS II), immune function impairment, total bilirubin (TBIL), and PaO2/FiO2 
were identified as independent predictors. The algorithm of the prediction model 
was: ln (Pr/(1 + Pr)) = -3.147 + 0.037 ∗ age - 
0.068 ∗ hemoglobin + 0.522 ∗ heart failure (yes) + 0.487 ∗ renal failure 
(yes) + 0.029 ∗ SAPS II + 0.697 ∗ immune function impairment 
(yes) + 0.280 ∗ TBIL (abnormal) - 0.006 ∗ PaO2/FiO2 (Pr represents the 
probability of death occurring). The AUC of the model was 0.791 (0.766-0.816), 
and the internal and the external validations both confirmed the good 
performance of the model. A nomogram for predicting the risk of death in ARDS 
patients was developed and validated. It may help clinicians early identify ARDS 
patients with high risk of death and thereby help reduce the mortality and 
improve the survival of ARDS.

BACKGROUND: Frailty has been recognized as an important prognostic indicator in 
patients with acute myocardial infarction (AMI). However, no study has focused 
on critical AMI patients. We aimed to determine the impact of frailty on short- 
and long-term mortality risk in critical AMI patients.
METHODS: Data from the Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care (MIMIC)-IV 
database was used. Frailty was assessed using the Hospital Frailty Risk Score 
(HFRS). Outcomes were in-hospital mortality and 1-year mortality. Logistic 
regression and Cox proportional-hazards models were used to investigate the 
association between frailty and outcomes.
RESULTS: Among 5,003 critical AMI patients, 2,176 were non-frail (43.5%), 2,355 
were pre-frail (47.1%), and 472 were frail (9.4%). The in-hospital mortality 
rate was 13.8%, and the 1-year mortality rate was 29.5%. In our multivariable 
model, frailty was significantly associated with in-hospital mortality [odds 
ratio (OR) = 1.30, 95% confidence interval (CI): 1.20-1.41] and 1-year mortality 
[hazard ratio (HR) = 1.29, 95% CI: 1.24-1.35] as a continuous variable (per 
five-score increase). When assessed as categorical variables, pre-frailty and 
frailty were both associated with in-hospital mortality (OR = 2.80, 95% CI: 
2.19-3.59 and OR = 2.69, 95% CI: 1.93-3.73, respectively) and 1-year mortality 
(HR = 2.32, 95% CI: 2.00-2.69 and HR = 2.81, 95% CI: 2.33-3.39, respectively) 
after adjustment for confounders. Subgroup analysis showed that frailty was only 
associated with in-hospital mortality in critically ill patients with 
non-ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) but not STEMI (p for 
interaction = 0.012). In addition, frailty was associated with 1-year mortality 
in both STEMI and non-STEMI patients (p for interaction = 0.447). The addition 
of frailty produced the incremental value over the initial model generated by 
baseline characteristics for both in-hospital and 1-year mortality.
CONCLUSION: Frailty, as assessed by the HFRS, was associated with both 
in-hospital and 1-year mortality in critical AMI patients. Frailty improves the 
prediction of short- and long-term mortality in critical AMI patients and may 
have potential clinical applications.

BACKGROUND: Sepsis is a life-threatening condition that requires rapid 
assessment to reduce mortality. This study investigates the relationship between 
the Neutrophil-to-Monocyte/Lymphocyte Ratio (NMLR) upon ICU admission and 28-day 
mortality in sepsis patients.
METHODS: A retrospective analysis was performed using clinical data from sepsis 
patients in the Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care IV (MIMIC-IV). 
Multivariate logistic regression, sensitivity analyses, and Restricted Cubic 
Spline (RCS) models were employed to explore the relationship between ICU 
admission NMLR and 28-day mortality. Kaplan-Meier method and inverse probability 
weighting (IPW) were used to adjust for confounders and estimate survival 
outcomes. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve evaluating the 
predictive value of NLMR for 28-day mortality in ICU sepsis patients. Subgroup 
analyses considered factors like age, sex, race, comorbidities, and disease 
severity.
RESULTS: In total, 8,710 patients were included. Increased NMLR was associated 
with higher 28-day all-cause mortality, confirmed by multiple logistic 
regression models. In Model 3, after adjusting for confounders, each standard 
deviation increase in NMLR was associated with a 1.5% increase in 28-day 
mortality risk. Kaplan-Meier and IPW survival analyses showed higher 28-day 
all-cause mortality in patients with elevated NMLR levels at ICU admission 
compared to those with lower levels (p < 0.0001, p = 0.031). RCS models 
suggested a potential non-linear relationship between NMLR and 28-day mortality. 
ROC curve for the NMLR model, with an AUC of 0.658 (95% CI: 0.642-0.673). 
Sensitivity analyses confirmed the association even after excluding patients 
with myocardial infarction and severe liver disease.
CONCLUSION: Elevated NMLR at ICU admission is significantly associated with 
increased 28-day all-cause mortality in sepsis patients, suggesting its 
potential as an early prognostic indicator for risk assessment and intervention.

BACKGROUND: It has not been verified whether there is a correlation between 
admission hyperlactatemia and outcomes in critically ill patients with acute 
myocardial infarction (AMI), especially in large data studies, which we aimed to 
do in this study.
METHODS: For this retrospective study, we extracted analysis data from a famous 
online intensive care unit database, the Medical Information Mart for Intensive 
Care (MIMIC)-IV. Included patients were divided into four groups according to 
the serum lactate level on admission. Hospital mortality and mortality over time 
were the main outcomes. To explore the relationship between admission 
hyperlactatemia and outcomes in critically ill patients with AMI, logistic 
regression, Cox regression, Kaplan-Meier curves, and subgroup analyses were 
used.
RESULTS: 2171 patients matching the selection criteria were enrolled in this 
study. After adjusting for potential confounding factors, hyperlactatemia on 
admission contributed to increased short-term mortality in critically ill 
patients with AMI. The adjusted odds ratio for hospital mortality were 1.62, 
3.46 and 5.28 in the mild, moderate, and severe hyperlactatemia groups (95% CI: 
1.20-2.18, 2.15-5.58, and 2.20-12.70, respectively). The adjusted hazard ratio 
for 7-day and 30-day mortality were 1.99 and 1.35 (95% CI: 1.45-2.73 and 
1.09-1.67) in the mild hyperlactatemia group, 3.33 and 2.31 (95% CI: 2.22-4.99 
and 1.72-3.10) in the moderate hyperlactatemia group, 4.81 and 2.91 (95% CI: 
2.86-8.08 and 1.88-4.50) in the severe hyperlactatemia group. The adjusted 
hazard ratio for 1-year and 5-year mortality were 2.03 and 1.93 (95% CI: 
1.58-2.62 and 1.52-2.47) in the moderate hyperlactatemia group, 1.92 and 1.74 
(95% CI: 1.28-2.89 and 1.17-2.59) in the severe hyperlactatemia group. Subgroup 
analyses indicated that the positive correlation between serum lactate level on 
admission and short-term mortality of critically ill patients with AMI was 
similar in the subgroups of cardiogenic shock and acute heart failure (P for 
interaction > 0.05).
CONCLUSION: Hyperlactatemia, especially moderate and severe hyperlactatemia, on 
admission is closely related to higher short-term mortality incidence in 
critically ill patients with AMI. The relationship between serum lactate level 
on admission and short-term mortality of critical AMI patients is stable in 
subgroups of cardiogenic shock and acute heart failure.

BACKGROUND: Atrial fibrillation (AF) is the most prevalent cardiac arrhythmia in 
critically ill patients and significantly impacts mortality. This study sought 
to evaluate the impact of new-onset AF on mortality in a critically ill 
population.
METHODS: This study identified 48018 adult patients admitted to the ICU from the 
Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care (MIMIC)-IV database. Patients were 
categorized as no AF, pre-existing AF, or new-onset AF. We analyzed mortality at 
3 months, 6 months, and 1 year.
RESULTS: Overall, 31,562 (65.73%) patients had no AF, 4877 (10.16%) had 
pre-existing AF, and 11,579 (24.11%) had new-onset AF. Median ages were 61.47 
years (no AF), 76.12 years (pre-existing AF), and 75.26 years (new-onset AF). 
New-onset AF was associated with the highest mortality rates: 25.16% at 3 
months, 29.23% at 6 months, and 34.04% at 1 year, compared to 17.94%, 22.55%, 
and 28.52% for pre-existing AF, and 14.54%, 17.25%, and 20.69% for no AF 
respectively (p < 0.001 for all). Multivariate Cox regression indicated that 
new-onset AF significantly increased the risk of 1-year mortality by 15.5% 
compared to no AF (HR: 1.155, 95% CI: 1.101-1.212; p < 0.001) and by 23.9% 
compared to pre-existing AF (HR: 1.239, 95% CI: 1.164-1.318; p < 0.001). 
Kaplan-Meier analysis confirmed lower survival probabilities for new-onset AF 
over one year compared to the other groups (p < 0.001).
CONCLUSION: In patients with critical illness, new-onset AF is associated with 
an increased risk of mortality compared with pre-existing AF or no AF.

BACKGROUND: Heart failure (HF) patients in intensive care units (ICUs) are 
rather poorly studied based on varying left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) 
classification. Characteristics and prognosis of patients in ICUs with HF with 
mildly reduced ejection fraction (HFmrEF), HF with reduced ejection fraction 
(HFrEF) and HF with preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF) require further 
clarification.
METHODS: Data involving clinical information and 4-year follow-up records of HF 
patients were extracted and integrated from the Medical Information Mart for 
Intensive Care III (MIMIC-III) database. Tests were carried out to identity 
differences among these three HF subtypes. Prognostic analyses were performed 
using Kaplan-Meier survival analysis and Cox proportional-hazards regression 
modeling. To develop a novel prediction nomogram, forward selection was used as 
the best-fit model. Prognostic heterogeneity of the subgroups prespecified by 
stratification factors in pairwise comparisons was presented using forest plots.
RESULTS: A total of 4150 patients were enrolled in this study. HFmrEF had the 
lowest all-cause mortality rate during the 4-year follow-up, which was 
significantly different from HFrEF and HFpEF (Log-Rank p  <  0.001). The Cox 
proportional-hazards regression model also showed that a comparison of HFrEF 
versus HFmrEF indicated a hazard ratio (HR) of 0.76 (95% CI 0.61-0.94, p = 
0.011) and HFrEF versus HFpEF indicated a HR 0.93 (95% CI 0.82-1.07, p = 0.307). 
Following a multivariable analysis, 13 factors were confirmed as independent. A 
new nomogram was established and quantified with a concordance index (C-index) 
of 0.70 (95% CI 0.67-0.73), and the internal validation indicated the accuracy 
of the model. Stratification factors such as a history of coronary artery bypass 
grafting (CABG) and comorbidity of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) 
induced prognostic heterogeneity among the three subtypes.
CONCLUSIONS: Clinical characteristics and prognosis significantly varied among 
the three subtypes of HF patients in ICUs, with HFmrEF patients achieving the 
best prognosis. The novel prediction model, tailored for this population, showed 
a satisfying prediction ability.

BACKGROUND: The purpose of this article is to assess the relationship between 
serum albumin level and long length of stay (LOS) of inpatients with acute heart 
failure (AHF) in the intensive care unit (ICU).
METHODS: We retrospectively analyzed data of 2280 patients with AHF from the 
medical information mart for intensive care IV (the MIMIC-IV) database. 
Multivariate logistic regression was performed to evaluate the association 
between serum albumin and long LOS, and the development of the predictive model 
was based on independent predictors of long LOS.
RESULTS: According to the statistical results, A negative linear relationship 
was presented between albumin and long LOS of AHF patients in the ICU (P for 
trend <0.001), and serum albumin could predict long LOS (AUC 0.649, 95%CI 
0.616-0.683, P <0.001). Based on independent predictors, including respiratory 
failure (OR 1.672, 95%CI 1.289-2.169, P<0.001), WBC (OR 1.046, 95%CI 
1.031-1.061, P<0.001), creatinine (OR 1.221, 95%CI 1.098-1.257, P<0.001), 
glucose (OR 1.010, 95%CI 1.007-1.012, P<0.001), lactic acid (OR 1.269, 95%CI 
1.167-1.381, P<0.001), and albumin (OR 0.559, 95%CI 0.450-0.695, P<0.001), 
identified by multivariable logistic regression analysis, we developed the 
nomogram to predict the probability of long LOS of AHF patients in the ICU. The 
nomogram accurately predicted the probability of long LOS (AUC 0.740, 95%CI 
0.712-0.768, P<0.001). The calibration suggested the predictive probability was 
highly consistent with the actual probability of long LOS. Decision curve 
analysis (DCA) also suggested that the nomogram was applicable in the clinic.
CONCLUSION: Serum albumin level was negatively associated with LOS among AHF 
patients. The predictive model based on serum albumin has predictive value for 
evaluating the length of stay in AHF patients.

BACKGROUNDS: Hematocrit is found an independent risk factor for acute kidney 
injury (AKI) in certain patients, but this effect in patients with acute 
myocardial infarction (AMI) is unclear. We aim to identify the relationship 
between hematocrit and AKI in patients with AMI.
METHODS: The patient data for the discovery and validation cohorts were 
extracted from the electronic Intensive Care Unit database and the Medical 
Information Mart for Intensive Care III database, respectively, to identify the 
relationship between hematocrit and AKI. With normal hematocrit as the 
reference, patients were divided into five groups based on the initial 
hematocrit value. The primary outcome was AKI during hospitalization. A 
multivariable logistic regression and a marginal effect analysis were used to 
evaluate the relationship between hematocrit and AKI.
RESULTS: In this study, a total of 9692 patients diagnosed with AMI were 
included, with 7712 patients in the discovery cohort and 1980 patients in the 
validation cohort. In the discovery cohort, hematocrit in 30-33%, 27-30% or  <  
27% were independent risk factors for AKI in the multivariate logistic analysis, 
with odds ratio (OR) of 1.774 (95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.203-2.617, p = 
0.004), 1.834 (95% CI: 1.136-2.961, p = 0.013) and 2.577 (95% CI: 1.510-4.397, p 
 <  0.001), respectively. Additionally, in the validation cohort, low hematocrit 
levels independently contributed to an increased risk of AKI among patients with 
AMI. During the analysis of marginal effects, a significant negative linear 
relationship between hematocrit levels and AKI was observed.
CONCLUSIONS: Decreased hematocrit was an independent risk factor for AKI in 
patients with AMI. The relationship between hematocrit and AKI was negative 
linear.

BACKGROUND The aim of this study was to assess the impact of norepinephrine 
(NE), norepinephrine plus vasopressin (NE+VAS) and dopamine in patients with 
sepsis and heart failure. MATERIAL AND METHODS Data were extracted from the 
Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care III database, v1.4. Adults aged >18 
years in an Intensive Care Unit (ICU) who had heart failure and took 
vasopressors were included. The patients were divided into 3 groups: NE, NE+VAS, 
and dopamine. Differences in survival, treatment time, and organ function among 
the 3 groups were compared. Propensity score matching (PSM) was used to screen 
for possible prognostic differences, and regression analysis was used to further 
analyze and predict prognoses. RESULTS A total of 1864 patients were included. 
There were significant differences among the 3 groups in 7-, 28-, and 90-day 
mortality after PSM. The 5-year survival rates among the 3 groups also were 
significantly different (P<0.001). After Cox regression analysis, NE+VAS was an 
independent risk factor affecting 5-year survival (P<0.001). After multiple 
linear regression, dopamine was the factor related to ICU and hospital lengths 
of stay. CONCLUSIONS Compared with NE or dopamine alone, NE+VAS can reduce 
survival in patients with sepsis and heart failure who need vasopressors. 
Compared with the other 2 treatment options, dopamine can shorten ICU and 
hospital stays for these patients.

BACKGROUND: Low minimum heart rate (MHR) is common in critically ill myocardial 
infarction (MI) patients. However, the association between MHR and the mortality 
of critically ill MI patients remains unclear.
METHODS: In this retrospective cohort study, a total of 2,031 critically ill MI 
patients were enrolled from the Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care 
(MIMIC)-III database. Patients were divided into a low MHR group [MHR <60 beats 
per minute (bpm)] and a high MHR group (MHR ≥60 bpm). A Cox proportional hazard 
model was used to elucidate the association between these two groups and the 
mortality of MI patients. The association between mortality and MHR as a 
continuous variable was analyzed non-parametrically using restricted cubic 
splines. Sensitivity analyses were conducted to determine the impact of 
different admission heart rate, hypertension, atrial fibrillation, and 
vasopressor use on our results.
RESULTS: MI patients in the low MHR group had higher 30-day and 1-year mortality 
than those in the high MHR group (20.59% vs. 10.91%, P<0.001 and 29.76% vs. 
19.31%, P<0.001, respectively). After adjustment, the low MHR group was 
significantly correlated with 30-day mortality [hazard ratio, 1.779, 95% 
confidence interval (CI), 1.400-2.261, P<0.001] and 1-year mortality (hazard 
ratio, 1.537, 95% CI, 1.272-1.859, P<0.001). This correlation remained 
remarkable in patients with low or high admission heart rate, with or without 
hypertension, and with or without atrial fibrillation. An apparent L-curve 
relationship was observed between the 30-day mortality or 1-year mortality and 
MHR as a continuous variable.
CONCLUSIONS: MHR under 60 bpm may be associated with a higher risk for both 
30-day and 1-year mortality in critically ill MI patients. These findings 
highlight the possibility of MHR as an early risk indicator and potential 
therapeutic target for mortality in critically ill MI patients, which warrants 
further investigation.

A high serum anion gap (AG) at the time of patient admission can lead to the 
deterioration or even death; data are lacking for patients who suffer acute 
heart failure (AHF). The present study aimed at exploring the impact of serum AG 
(SAG) levels on the in-hospital mortality in AHF patients. The study conducted 
retrospective analysis on the data from the medical information mart for 
intensive care (MIMIC-IV) database in severe AHF cases. Serum AG, age, sex, 
concomitant diseases and laboratory tests were collected from patients at 
admission. Multivariate Cox proportional hazard regression model together with 
Kaplan Meier (K-M) survival curve served for analyzing the relationship of serum 
AG with the hospital all-cause mortality (ACM). In addition, subgroup analysis 
assisted in assessing the concordance. Data from 2774 AHF patients were 
collected in the study. The hospital ACM rate was 9.2% (254/2774). After 
correcting potential confounders, multivariate analysis compared the high serum 
AG level (≥ 16 mmol/L) and the low serum AG level (< 16 mmol/L) (hazard ratio 
(HR): 1.89 [95% CI 1.42-2.51]). In a similar way, K-M survival curve indicated 
that hospital survival was lower in patients with high serum, suggesting that 
high serum AG level could lead to poor AHF prognosis. In patients with AHF, high 
serum AG level could increase the hospital ACM.

PURPOSE: Peripheral differential leukocyte counts are accepted prognostic 
indicators in patients with acute myocardial infarction (AMI). Herein, we 
assessed the value of the admission (neutrophil+monocyte)/lymphocyte ratio 
(NMLR) in predicting in-hospital mortality in these patients.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: Samples of patients from the Medical Information Mart for 
Intensive Care IV (MIMIC-IV) database meeting the criteria were included. 
Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves were plotted to explore the 
predictive value and the optimum cut-off value of admission NMLR. Univariate and 
multivariate Cox regression analyses and restricted cubic spline (RCS) were 
performed to determine and visualize the association between admission NMLR and 
in-hospital mortality. The Kaplan-Meier (KM) method was used to plot survival 
curves of two groups with different admission NMLR levels.
RESULTS: Samples in the non-survival group had higher admission NMLR values than 
samples in the survival group (12.11 [7.22-21.05] vs. 6.38 [3.96-11.25], P < 
0.05). The area under the ROC curve (AUROC) [0.707 (95% Confidence Interval, 
0.677-0.737)] was significantly better than those of other indicators related to 
peripheral differential leukocyte counts, and the optimal cut-off value was 
8.518. Cox regression analysis identified that higher admission NMLR was an 
independent risk factor for in-hospital mortality. RCS visualized the uptrend 
and the non-linear relationship between admission NMLR and in-hospital mortality 
(P-value for non-linearity <0.05). The KM survival curve of the high admission 
NMLR group was significantly lower than that of the low admission NMLR group (P 
< 0.001), and the former was associated with an increased risk of in-hospital 
mortality compared to the latter (Hazard Ratio, 1.452; 95% Confidence Interval, 
1.132-1.862; P < 0.05).
CONCLUSION: An elevated admission NMLR is an independent predictor for high 
in-hospital mortality in patients with AMI. And it is superior to other 
leukocyte-related indexes.

OBJECTIVE: Association between neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio (NLR) on admission 
and poor prognosis in patients with acute heart failure (AHF) has been well 
established. However, the relationship between dynamic changes in NLR and 
in-hospital mortality in AHF patients has not been studied. Our purpose was to 
determine if an early change in NLR within the first week after AHF patients was 
admitted to intensive care unit (ICU) was associated with in-hospital mortality.
METHODS: Data from the medical information mart for intensive care IV (the 
MIMIC-IV) database was analyzed. The effect of baseline NLR on in-hospital 
mortality in critical patients with AHF was evaluated utilizing smooth curve 
fitting and multivariable logistic regression analysis. Moreover, comparison of 
the dynamic change in NLR among survivors and non-survivors was performed using 
the generalized additive mixed model (GAMM).
RESULTS: There were 1169 participants who took part in the present study, 986 of 
whom were in-hospital survivors and 183 of whom were in-hospital non-survivors. 
The smooth curve fitting revealed a positive relationship between baseline NLR 
and in-hospital mortality, and multivariable logistic regression analysis 
indicated that baseline NLR was an independent risk factor for in-hospital 
mortality (OR 1.04, 95% CI 1.02,1.07, P-value = 0.001). After adjusting for 
confounders, GAMM showed that the difference in NLR between survivors and 
non-survivors grew gradually during the first week after ICU admission, and the 
difference grew by an average of 0.51 per day (β = 0.51, 95% CI 0.45-0.56, 
P-value <0.001).
CONCLUSIONS: Baseline NLR was associated with poor prognosis in critical 
patients with AHF. Early rises in NLR were linked to higher in-hospital 
mortality, which suggests that keeping track of how NLR early changes might help 
identify short-term prognosis of critical patients with AHF.

BACKGROUND: Heart failure (HF), a global health challenge, is a leading cause of 
mortality in hospitalized patients. Early and accurate prognostic evaluation in 
these patients is vital for guiding clinical management. Our aim was to explore 
the association between albumin-corrected calcium (ACC) and mortality in 
hospitalized patients.
METHODS: This retrospective cohort study utilized data from the Medical 
Information Mart for Intensive Care IV (MIMIC-IV) database. Patients were 
stratified into three groups based on ACC levels. The association between ACC 
and clinical outcomes in HF patients was analyzed using Cox proportional hazards 
regression and restricted cubic spline models.
RESULTS: A total of 4,737 heart failure patients were included. Multifactorial 
Cox regression revealed that elevated ACC levels were significantly associated 
with increased 30-day and 180-day mortality. Restricted cubic spline analysis 
demonstrated a U-shaped relationship between ACC levels and mortality, with an 
inflection point at 9.18. Patients with ACC levels above 9.18 exhibited an 20.4% 
higher risk of 30-day mortality [Hazard ratio (HR): 1.204, 95% (Confidence 
interval) CI: 1.009-1.437] and a 20.8% higher risk of 180-day mortality (HR: 
1.208, 95% CI: 1.019-1.431) compared to those with ACC below 9.18.
CONCLUSIONS: The observed U-shaped association between ACC levels and 30- and 
180-day mortality in HF patients highlights the potential utility of ACC as a 
prognostic marker.

BACKGROUND: Previous studies have indicated that the ratio of lactate/albumin 
(L/A) has predictive value for the prognosis of critically ill patients with 
heart failure. Some studies have also indicated that a low serum bicarbonate 
concentration is inversely related to the mortality risk of patients with 
cardiogenic shock. However, the value of bicarbonate and the L/A ratio for 
predicting the mortality risk of patients with acute myocardial infarction (AMI) 
is still unclear. We therefore conducted a retrospective study to research this 
problem.
METHODS: The subjects of this study were patients with AMI, and the data source 
was the Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care III database. The primary 
endpoint was 30-day all-cause mortality after admission. The Receiver operating 
characteristic (ROC) curve was used to compare the predictive value of L/A 
ratio, lactate and albumin for end-point events. The effects of different L/A 
ratio levels and different bicarbonate concentrations on 7-day and 30-day 
all-cause mortality were compared using Kaplan-Meier (K-M) curves. Hazard ratios 
for different L/A ratio and different bicarbonate concentrations were 
investigated using COX proportional hazards models.
RESULTS: The Area Under Curve (AUC) of L/A ratio, lactate, and albumin were 
0.736, 0.718, and 0.620, respectively. (1) L/A ratio: The patients were divided 
into three groups according to their L/A ratio: tertile T1 (L/A ratio ≤ 0.47), 
tertile T2 (L/A ratio ≤ 0.97), and tertile T3 (L/A ratio > 0.97). The T2 and T3 
groups had higher 30-day all-cause mortality risks than the T1 group. The 
restricted cubic spline (RCS) model indicated that there was a nonlinear 
relationship between L/A ratio and 30-day mortality (P < 0.05). (2) Bicarbonate 
concentration: The patients were also divided into three groups based on their 
bicarbonate concentration: G1 (22-27 mmol/L), G2 (< 22 mmol/L), and G3 
(> 27 mmol/L). The G2 and G3 groups had higher 30-day all-cause mortality risks 
than the G1 group. The RCS model indicated that there was a nonlinear 
relationship between bicarbonate concentration and 30-day mortality (P < 0.05). 
The RCS model indicated that there was a nonlinear relationship between 
hemoglobin level and 30-day all-cause mortality (P < 0.05).
CONCLUSION: L/A ratio and bicarbonate concentration and hemoglobin level have 
predictive value for predicting 30-day mortality in patients with acute 
myocardial infarction.

BACKGROUND: The optimal threshold of hyperglycaemia at admission for identifying 
high-risk individuals in patients with acute myocardial infarction (AMI) and its 
impact on clinical prognosis are still unclear.
METHODS: We retrospectively reviewed 2027 patients with AMI admitted from June 
2001 to December 2012 in the 'Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care III' 
database. The significant cut-off values of admission blood glucose (Glucose_0) 
for predicting hospital mortality in patients with AMI with and without diabetes 
were obtained from the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve, then 
patients were assigned to hyperglycaemia and non-hyperglycaemia groups based on 
corresponding cut-off values. The primary endpoints were the hospital and 1-year 
mortality.
RESULTS: Among 2027 patients, death occurred in 311 patients (15.3%). According 
to the ROC curve, the significant cut-off values of Glucose_0 to predict 
hospital mortality were 224.5 and 139.5 mg/dL in patients with diabetes and 
without diabetes, respectively. The crude hospital and 1-year mortality of the 
hyperglycaemia subgroup were higher than the corresponding non-hyperglycaemia 
group (p< 0.01). After adjustment, regardless of the state of diabetes, 
hyperglycaemia at admission was related to significantly increased hospital 
mortality in patients with AMI. For patients with AMI without diabetes, 
hyperglycaemia at admission was positively correlated with the increase of 
1-year mortality (HR, 1.47; 95% CI 1.18 to 1.82; p=0.001). Nevertheless, this 
trend disappeared in those with diabetes (HR, 1.35; 95% CI 0.93 to 1.95; 
p=0.113).
CONCLUSION: Hyperglycaemia at admission was an independent predictor for 
mortality during hospitalisation and at 1-year in patients with AMI, especially 
in patients without diabetes.

OBJECTIVES: We aimed to investigate the association between red cell 
distribution width-to-platelet ratio (RPR), and in-hospital mortality in 
critically ill patients with acute myocardial infarction (AMI).
DESIGN: A retrospective cohort study.
SETTING: Data were collected from the Medical Information Mart for Intensive 
Care database (MIMIC-IV) consisting of critically ill participants between 2008 
and 2019 at the Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Centre in Boston.
PARTICIPANTS: A total of 5067 patients with AMI were enrolled from the MIMIC-IV 
database.
PRIMARY AND SECONDARY OUTCOME: In-hospital mortality.
RESULTS: A total of 4034 patients survived, while 1033 died. In a multiple 
regression analysis adjusted for age, weight and ethnicity, RPR also showed a 
positive correlation with in-hospital mortality (HR 1.91, 95% CI 1.42 to 2.56, 
p<0.0001). Moreover, after adjusting for additional confounding factors, obvious 
changes were observed (HR 1.63, 95% CI 1.03 to 2.57, p=0.0357). In model 2, the 
high ratio quartile remained positively associated with hospital mortality 
compared with the low ratio quartile (HR 1.20, 95% CI 1.01 to 1. 43), with a 
p-value trend of 0.0177. Subgroup analyses showed no significant effect 
modifications on the association between RPR and in-hospital mortality in the 
different AMI groups (p>0.05).
CONCLUSION: RPR is an independent predictor of in-hospital mortality in 
critically ill patients with AMI.

BACKGROUND: Congestive heart failure (HF) is a common condition in the intensive 
care unit (ICU). Cardiomyopathy is an important etiological factor in HF. 
However, few studies have explored the effect of cardiomyopathy on the prognosis 
of HF. This study explored the association between comorbid cardiomyopathy and 
the outcomes of critically ill patients with congestive HF.
METHODS: A retrospective cohort study was performed using data extracted from 
Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care IV (MIMIC-IV) database. All adult 
patients with the first ICU admission were enrolled as participants but those 
diagnosed with cardiomyopathy alone were excluded. The demographics, 
comorbidities, vital signs, laboratory tests, scoring systems, and treatments of 
patients were extracted to further analyze. The composite endpoints included 
in-hospital mortality, cardiac arrest, and re-admission to the ICU. The 
association between cardiomyopathy comorbidity and the composite endpoints was 
assessed using propensity-score matching (PSM) and multivariable logistic 
regression models.
RESULTS: A total of 27,901 critically ill patients were enrolled, including 
1,023 patients diagnosed with cardiomyopathy and congestive HF. The average age 
of the cohort was 64.37±17.36 years, and 58.13% of the patients were men. The 
ethnicity of patients was mainly white (64.67%). Multivariable logistic 
regression analyses found the risk of composite endpoints in patients with 
cardiomyopathy was higher than other groups [odds ratio (OR) =1.87; 95% 
confidence interval (CI): 1.62-2.15; P<0.001]. Compared to patients with 
congestive HF alone (OR =1.43; 95% CI: 1.26-1.62; P<0.001), patients with 
cardiomyopathy had a similar risk of in-hospital death (OR =1.35; 95% CI: 
1.06-1.71; P=0.014). Moreover, the risks of cardiac arrest (OR =1.53; 95% CI: 
1.01-2.34; P=0.029) and re-admission to the ICU (OR =1.74; 95% CI: 1.39-2.17; 
P<0.001) were both higher in patients with cardiomyopathy than other groups. 
After PSM, the risk of composite endpoints was still higher in patients with 
cardiomyopathy (OR =1.64; 95% CI: 1.33-2.02; P<0.001). The association was 
consistent among patients admitted to the coronary care unit (CCU) and medical 
ICU (MICU)/surgical ICU (SICU).
CONCLUSIONS: Comorbid cardiomyopathy increased the risk of composite endpoints 
in patients with congestive HF admitted to the ICU. Cardiomyopathy is related to 
the poor outcomes of critically ill patients with congestive HF.

Background : While acute myocardial infarction (AMI) is widely recognized as the 
primary cause of cardiogenic shock (CS), non-AMI-related CS has been excluded 
from the majority of CS studies. Information on its prognostic factors remains 
largely understudied, and it is necessary to focus on these patients to identify 
the specific risk factors. In this study, we aimed to build and validate a 
predictive nomogram and risk classification system. Methods: 1298 patients and 
548 patients with CS from the Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care IV and 
III databases were included in the study after excluding patients with AMI. 
Lasso and logistic regression analysis were used to identify statistically 
significant predictors, which were finally involved in the nomogram. The 
predictive performance of the nomogram was validated by calibration plots and 
was compared with other scoring systems by area under curve and decision curve 
analysis curves. Results: Age, heart rate, white blood cell count, albumin 
level, lactic acid level, GCS score, 24-h urine output, and vasopressor use were 
identified as the most critical factors for in-hospital death. Based on these 
results, a nomogram was established for predicting in-hospital mortality. The 
area under curve value of the nomogram was 0.806 in the training group and 0.814 
and 0.730 in the internal and external validation sets, respectively, which were 
significantly higher than those of other commonly used intensive care unit 
scoring systems (Simplified Acute Physiology Score II, Acute Physiology Score 
III, and Sequential Organ Failure Assessment). In addition, the survival curve 
showed significant differences in the 30-day survival of the three risk 
subgroups divided by the nomogram. Conclusion: For non-AMI-associated CS, a 
predictive nomogram and risk classification system were developed and validated, 
and the nomogram demonstrated good performance in prognostic prediction and risk 
stratification.

BACKGROUND: In acute myocardial infarction (AMI), acute hepatic injury is an 
independent risk factor for prognosis and is associated with complex coagulation 
dynamics. This study aims to determine the interaction between acute hepatic 
injury and coagulation dysfunction on outcomes in AMI patients.
METHODS: The Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care (MIMIC-III) database 
was used to identify AMI patients who underwent liver function testing within 24 
h of admission. After ruling out previous hepatic injury, patients were divided 
into the hepatic injury group and the nonhepatic injury group based on whether 
the alanine transaminase (ALT) level at admission was >3 times the upper limit 
of normal (ULN). The primary outcome was intensive care unit (ICU) mortality.
RESULTS: Among 703 AMI patients (67.994% male, median age 65.139 years 
(55.757-76.859)), acute hepatic injury occurred in 15.220% (n = 107). Compared 
with the nonhepatic injury group, patients with hepatic injury had a higher 
Elixhauser comorbidity index (ECI) score (12 (6-18) vs. 7 (1-12), p < 0.001) and 
more severe coagulation dysfunction (85.047% vs. 68.960%, p < 0.001). In 
addition, acute hepatic injury was associated with increased in-hospital 
mortality (odds ratio (OR) = 3.906; 95% CI: 2.053-7.433; p < 0.001), ICU 
mortality (OR = 4.866; 95% CI: 2.489-9.514; p < 0.001), 28-day mortality (OR = 
4.129; 95% CI: 2.215-7.695; p < 0.001) and 90-day mortality (OR = 3.407; 95% CI: 
1.883-6.165; p < 0.001) only in patients with coagulation disorder but not with 
normal coagulation. Unlike patients with coagulation disorder and normal liver, 
patients with both coagulation disorder and acute hepatic injury had greater 
odds of ICU mortality (OR = 8.565; 95% CI: 3.467-21.160; p < 0.001) than those 
with normal coagulation.
CONCLUSIONS: The effects of acute hepatic injury on prognosis are likely to be 
modulated by early coagulation disorder in AMI patients.

BACKGROUND: There are less studies focusing on the sedative therapy of acute 
myocardial infarction (AMI) critical patients. This study aim to compare the 
impact on the prognosis of AMI critical patients of using midazolam, propofol 
and dexmedetomidine.
METHODS: We collected clinical data from the Medical Information Mart for 
Intensive Care III (MIMIC III) database. Data on 427 AMI patients with sedatives 
using were recruited from in Coronary Heart Disease Intensive Care unit (CCU).
RESULTS: There were 143 patients in midazolam using, 272 in propofol using and 
28 in dexmedetomidine using. The rate of 28-days mortality was 23.9% in overall 
patients. Through logistic regression analysis, only midazolam using was 
significant association with increased 28-days mortality when compared with 
propofol or dexmedetomidine using. In the subgroup analysis of age, gender, body 
mass index (BMI), white blood cell (WBC), beta-block, and revascularization, the 
association between midazolam using and increased 28-days mortality remained 
significantly. Through propensity score matching, 140 patients using midazolam 
and 192 using non-midazolam were successfully matched, the midazolam using 
presented with higher rate of CCU mortality, hospital mortality and 28-days 
mortality, longer of mechanical ventilation time and CCU duration. E-value 
analysis suggested robustness to unmeasured confounding.
CONCLUSION: Propofol or dexmedetomidine are preferred to be used in AMI critical 
patients for sedative therapy.

BACKGROUND: This investigation aimed to evaluate the efficacy of the Systemic 
Inflammatory Response Index (SIRI) in prognosticating short-term all-cause 
mortality among patients diagnosed with acute myocardial infarction (AMI) in the 
intensive care unit (ICU).
METHODS AND RESULTS: Clinical data were obtained from the Medical Information 
Mart for Intensive Care-IV (MIMIC-IV) database. A total of 4,291 patients were 
included in the cohort. Results from multivariate regression analyses showed 
that the quartile of the natural logarithm of SIRI (ln-SIRI) was independently 
associated with mortality. Compared to patients in the first quartile (Q1), 
patients in the second quartile (Q2) and fourth quartile (Q4) were significantly 
associated with an increased risk of 30-day (HR = 2.031, 95% CI: 1.604-2.571, 
p < 0.001 and HR = 1.703, 95% CI: 1.32-2.195, p < 0.001) and 90-day all-cause 
mortality (HR = 2.063, 95% CI: 1.68-2.532, p < 0.001 and HR = 1.788, 95% CI: 
1.435-2.227, p < 0.001), which is consistent with the results of the 
Kaplan-Meier analysis and the results of multivariate regression analyses by 
classifying into 12 groups based on dodeciles of SIRI. Curve fitting showed a 
curvilinear relationship and further threshold saturation effects showed that, 
for 90-day mortality, each unit increased in ln-SIRI, when the ln-SIRI level is 
less than 2.9, the patient's mortality increases by 23.2% (OR: 1.232; 95% CI: 
1.111-1.367; p < 0.001); when the ln-SIRI is greater than 2.9 and less than 4.6, 
the patient's mortality decreases by 44.4% (OR: 0.554; 95% CI: 0.392-0.789; 
p = 0.001); when ln SIR > 4.6, the patient's mortality increases by 24.7% (OR: 
1.247; 95% CI: 1.108-1.404; p < 0.001). Moreover, the length of stay in the 
hospital was lower in patients in the third quartile (Q3) (coefficient: -1.999; 
95% CI: -2.834 - -1.165, p < 0.001). The length of stay in the ICU was higher in 
patients in Q2 and Q4 (coefficient: 0.685;95% CI: 0.243-1.128; p = 0.0024 and 
coefficient: 0.989;95% CI: 0.528-1.451; p < 0.001). Furthermore, SIRI may 
outperform NLR in predicting short-term mortality.
CONCLUSION: SIRI is an independent risk factor for 30- and 90-day mortality, and 
length of stay in ICU for critical AMI patients.

Background: Heart failure (HF) is the terminal stage of various heart diseases. 
Conventional treatments have poor efficacy, and diuretic resistance can present. 
Previous studies have found that the use of glucocorticoids can enhance the 
diuretic effect of patients with heart failure and reduce heart failure 
symptoms. However, the relationship between glucocorticoid use and mortality in 
patients with heart failure in intensive care units is unclear. Objectives: The 
aim of this study was to determine the association between glucocorticoid use 
and all-cause mortality in critically ill patients with heart failure. Methods: 
The information on patients with heart failure in this study was extracted from 
the MIMIC-III (Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care-III) database. 
Patients in the glucocorticoid and non-glucocorticoid groups were matched using 
propensity scores. The Kaplan-Meier method was used to explore the difference in 
survival probability between the two groups. A Cox proportional-hazards 
regression model was used to analyze the hazard ratios (HRs) for the two patient 
groups. Subgroup analyses were performed with prespecified stratification 
variables to demonstrate the robustness of the results. Results: The study 
included 9,482 patients: 2,099 in the glucocorticoid group and 7,383 in the 
non-glucocorticoid group. There were 2,055 patients in each group after 
propensity-score matching. The results indicated that the non-glucocorticoid 
group was not significantly associated with reduced mortality in patients with 
heart failure during the 14-day follow-up period [HRs = .901, 95% confidence 
interval (CI) = .767-1.059]. During the follow-up periods of 15-30 and 
15-90 days, the mortality risk was significantly lower in the non-glucocorticoid 
group than in the glucocorticoid group (HRs = .497 and 95% CI = .370-.668, and 
HRs = .400 and 95% CI = .310-.517, respectively). Subgroup analyses indicated no 
interaction among each stratification variable and glucocorticoid use. 
Conclusion: Glucocorticoid use was associated with an increased mortality risk 
in critically ill patients with heart failure.

BACKGROUND: The anion gap (AG) has been linked to the prognosis of many 
cardiovascular disorders. However, the correlation between albumin-corrected 
anion gap (ACAG) and 30 d all-cause mortality of intensive care patients with 
acute myocardial infarction (AMI) is unclear. Furthermore, owing to the lack of 
studies, it is also unknown whether ACAG is more accurate than AG in 
predicting the mortality of AMI.
METHODS: The Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care IV (MIMIC IV) 
dataset was used to provide patient data in this retrospective cohort study. 
ACAG is computed using the formulae: [4.4-{albumin (g/dl)}] × 2.5 + AG. The 
primary outcome was 30 d all-cause mortality intensive care patients with AMI. 
To explore the prognostic worthiness of ACAG, the receiver operating 
characteristic curve, smooth curve fitting, Cox regression model, and 
Kaplan survival analysis was performed.
RESULTS: We enrolled 2,160 patients in this study. ACAG had a better predictive 
value for 30 d all-cause mortality than AG, with an area under the curve of 
0.66. The association between ACAG levels and overall mortality was nonlinear. 
In our model, after correcting for confounding factors, the ACAG was the 
independent predictor for 30 d all-cause mortality (HR 1.75, 95%CI 1.24, 2.47). 
ACAG K-M estimator curve analyses revealed that the group with 
ACAG ≥ 21.75 mmol/l had poor survival rate than the other group.
CONCLUSIONS: High serum ACAG levels were a significant risk factor for 30 d 
all-cause mortality in critically ill patients with AMI. ACAG concentration and 
30 d all-cause mortality had a nonlinear relationship. ACAG had better 
predictive value in identifying 30 d all-cause mortality of patients with AMI in 
ICU than the AG.

BACKGROUND: Patients with acute myocardial infarction (AMI) complicated by acute 
kidney injury (AKI) tend to have a poor prognosis. However, the exact mechanism 
of the co-occurrence of the two diseases is unknown. Therefore, this study aims 
to determine the risk factors for severe AKI in patients with AMI.
METHODS: A total of 2022 patients were included in the Medical Information Mart 
for Intensive Care. Variables were identified via univariate logistic 
regression, and the variables were corrected via multivariate logistic 
regression. Restricted cubic splines were used to examine the risks associated 
with the variables. The Kaplan-Meier method was used to compare the risk of 
severe AKI among the patients.
RESULTS: Patients with severe AKI had a higher in-hospital mortality rate (28.6% 
vs. 9.0%, P < 0.001) and a longer duration of intensive care (6.5 days vs. 2.9 
days, P < 0.001). In patients with AMI, the mean systolic blood pressure (SBP); 
international normalized ratio (INR); the levels of blood urea nitrogen (BUN), 
glucose, and calcium; and a history of liver disease were found to be the 
independent risk factors for developing severe AKI after their admission. 
Increased levels of BUN and blood glucose and a high INR increased the risk of 
severe AKI; however, increased levels of calcium decreased the risk; SBP 
presented a U-shaped curve relationship.
CONCLUSIONS: Patients with severe AKI have a poor prognosis following an episode 
of AMI. Furthermore, in patients with AMI, SBP; INR; a history of liver disease; 
and the levels of BUN, glucose, and calcium are the independent risk factors for 
developing severe AKI after their admission.

BACKGROUND: It's recognized that stress hyperglycemia ratio (SHR) is considered 
a significant indicator of poor prognosis in many diseases. However, its role in 
critically ill patients with acute heart failure (acute HF) remains 
underexplored.
METHODS: We conducted a retrospective cohort study on patients with acute HF 
included in the Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care IV (MIMIC-IV) 
version 2.2 database. A restricted cubic spline (RCS) regression analysis was 
used to explore the relationship between SHR and the risk of all-cause mortality 
in these patients. Subsequently, a Cox regression model was used to evaluate the 
relationship between SHR and mortality in acute HF patients.
RESULTS: A total of 1,644 acute HF patients were included in the study and 
divided into two groups: the low SHR group (SHR < 1.06, N = 823) and the high 
SHR group (SHR ≥ 1.06, N = 821). In our study, the 30-day, 90-day, 180-day, and 
365-day mortality rates for acute HF were 7.0%, 12%, 15%, and 19%, respectively, 
with higher mortality rates observed in the high SHR group compared to the low 
SHR group. SHR levels showed a linear relationship with all-cause mortality. 
Furthermore, SHR as a continuous variable shows a significant positive 
correlation with 30-day (HR = 2.31, 95% CI: 1.58-3.39), 90-day (HR = 1.81, 95% 
CI: 1.31-2.52), 180-day (HR = 1.57, 95% CI: 1.16-2.12), and 365-day (HR = 1.41, 
95% CI: 1.07-1.85) all-cause mortality. After categorization, high SHR remains 
associated with increased 30-day (HR = 2.4, 95% CI: 1.59-3.61), 90-day 
(HR = 1.76, 95% CI: 1.31-2.36), 180-day (HR = 1.51, 95% CI: 1.16-1.95), and 
365-day (HR = 1.38, 95% CI: 1.09-1.73) all-cause mortality.
CONCLUSION: Our findings indicate that high SHR is an independent predictor of 
poor short- and long-term prognosis in acute HF patients. Understanding the 
impact of SHR on mortality in acute HF is crucial as it can assist clinicians in 
identifying high-risk patients and adjusting treatment strategies accordingly.

BACKGROUND: Atrial fibrillation (AF) is a common cardiac arrhythmia. The ratio 
of red cell distribution width (RDW) to albumin has been recognized as a 
reliable prognostic marker for poor outcomes in a variety of diseases. However, 
the evidence regarding the association between RDW to albumin ratio (RAR) and in 
hospital mortality in patients with AF admitted to the Intensive Care Unit (ICU) 
currently was unclear. The purpose of this study was to explore the association 
between RAR and in hospital mortality in patients with AF in the ICU.
METHODS: This retrospective cohort study used data from the Medical Information 
Mart for Intensive Care IV (MIMIC-IV) database for the identification of 
patients with atrial fibrillation (AF). The primary endpoint investigated was 
in-hospital mortality. Multivariable-adjusted Cox regression analysis and forest 
plots were utilized to evaluate the correlation between the RAR and in-hospital 
mortality among patients with AF admitted to ICU. Additionally, receiver 
operating characteristic (ROC) curves were conducted to assess and compare the 
predictive efficacy of RDW and the RAR.
RESULTS: Our study included 4,584 patients with AF with a mean age of 
75.1 ± 12.3 years, 57% of whom were male. The in-hospital mortality was 20.3%. 
The relationship between RAR and in-hospital mortality was linear. The Cox 
proportional hazard model, adjusted for potential confounders, found a high RAR 
independently associated with in hospital mortality. For each increase of 1 unit 
in RAR, there is a 12% rise in the in-hospital mortality rate (95% CI 
1.06-1.19). The ROC curves revealed that the discriminatory ability of the RAR 
was better than that of RDW. The area under the ROC curves (AUCs) for RAR and 
RDW were 0.651 (95%CI: 0.631-0.671) and 0.599 (95% CI: 0.579-0.620).
CONCLUSIONS: RAR is independently correlated with in hospital mortality and in 
AF. High level of RAR is associated with increased in-hospital mortality rates.

BACKGROUND: Body temperature (BT) has been used to evaluate the outcomes of 
patients with various diseases. In this study, patients with diastolic heart 
failure (DHF) in the intensive care unit (ICU) were examined for a correlation 
between BT and mortality.
METHODS: This was a retrospective cohort study of the Medical Information Mart 
for Intensive Care (MIMIC)-IV dataset. A total of 4,153 patients with DHF were 
included. The primary outcomes were 28-day ICU and higher in-hospital mortality 
rates. BT was used in the analyses both as a continuous variable and as a 
categorical variable. According to the distribution of BT, the patients were 
categorized into three groups (hypothermia BT <36.5°C, normal 36.5°C ≤ BT 
<37.5°C, and hyperthermia BT ≥37.5°C). Multivariate logistic regression analysis 
was performed to explore the association between BT and patient outcomes.
RESULTS: The proportions of the groups were 23.6, 69.2, and 7.2%, respectively. 
As a continuous variable, every 1°C increase in BT was associated with a 21% 
decrease in 28-day ICU mortality (OR: 0.79, 95% CI: 0.66-0.96, and p = 0.019) 
and a 23% decrease in in-hospital mortality (OR: 0.77, 95% CI: 0.66-0.91; and p 
= 0.002). When BT was used as a categorical variable, hypothermia was 
significantly associated with both 28-day ICU mortality (OR: 1.3, 95% CI: 
1.03-1.65; and p = 0.026) and in-hospital mortality (OR: 1.31, 95% CI: 
1.07-1.59; and p = 0.008). No statistical differences were observed between 
28-day ICU mortality and in-hospital mortality with hyperthermia after 
adjustment.
CONCLUSION: The first 24-h mean BT after ICU admission was associated with 
28-day ICU and in-hospital mortality in patients with DHF. Hypothermia 
significantly increased mortality, whereas hyperthermia did not.

BACKGROUND: Dexmedetomidine (DEX) is a commonly used sedative in the intensive 
care unit and has demonstrated cardioprotective properties against 
ischemia-reperfusion injury in preclinical studies. However, the protective 
effects of early treatment of DEX in patients with acute myocardial infarction 
(AMI) and its underlying mechanism are still not fully understood. This study 
aims to investigate the association between early DEX treatment and in-hospital 
mortality in patients with AMI, and to explore the potential mediating role of 
white blood cell (WBC) reduction in this relationship.
METHODS: A retrospective cohort analysis was conducted using the Medical 
Information Mart for Intensive Care IV (MIMIC-IV) database. Patients with AMI 
were divided into the DEX and non-DEX group, based on whether they received DEX 
treatment in the early stage of hospitalization. The primary outcome measured 
was in-hospital mortality. The study evaluated the association between DEX use 
and in-hospital mortality using the Kaplan-Meier (KM) method and Cox 
proportional hazards model. Additionally, 1:1 propensity score matching (PSM) 
was conducted to validate the results. Furthermore, causal mediation analysis 
(CMA) was utilized to explore potential causal pathways mediated by WBC 
reduction between early DEX use and the primary outcome.
RESULTS: This study analyzed data from 2,781 patients, with 355 in the DEX group 
and 2,426 in the non-DEX group. KM survival analysis revealed a significantly 
lower in-hospital mortality rate in the DEX group compared to the non-DEX group. 
After adjusting for multiple confounding factors, the Cox regression model 
demonstrated a significant positive impact of DEX on the risk of in-hospital 
mortality in patients with AMI, with hazard ratios (HR) of 0.50 (95% confidence 
interval (CI): 0.35-0.71, p < 0.0001). PSM analysis confirmed these results, 
showing HR of 0.49 (95% CI: 0.31-0.77, p = 0.0022). Additionally, CMA indicated 
that 13.7% (95% CI: 1.8%-46.9%, p = 0.022) of the beneficial effect of DEX on 
reducing in-hospital mortality in patients with AMI was mediated by the 
reduction in WBC.
CONCLUSION: The treatment of DEX was associated with a lower risk of in-hospital 
mortality in patients with AMI, potentially due to its anti-inflammatory 
properties.

BACKGROUND: Cardiac arrest (CA) is the leading cause of death in critically ill 
patients. Clinical research has shown that early identification of CA reduces 
mortality. Algorithms capable of predicting CA with high sensitivity have been 
developed using multivariate time series data. However, these algorithms suffer 
from a high rate of false alarms, and their results are not clinically 
interpretable.
OBJECTIVE: We propose an ensemble approach using multiresolution statistical 
features and cosine similarity-based features for the timely prediction of CA. 
Furthermore, this approach provides clinically interpretable results that can be 
adopted by clinicians.
METHODS: Patients were retrospectively analyzed using data from the Medical 
Information Mart for Intensive Care-IV database and the eICU Collaborative 
Research Database. Based on the multivariate vital signs of a 24-hour time 
window for adults diagnosed with heart failure, we extracted multiresolution 
statistical and cosine similarity-based features. These features were used to 
construct and develop gradient boosting decision trees. Therefore, we adopted 
cost-sensitive learning as a solution. Then, 10-fold cross-validation was 
performed to check the consistency of the model performance, and the Shapley 
additive explanation algorithm was used to capture the overall interpretability 
of the proposed model. Next, external validation using the eICU Collaborative 
Research Database was performed to check the generalization ability.
RESULTS: The proposed method yielded an overall area under the receiver 
operating characteristic curve (AUROC) of 0.86 and area under the 
precision-recall curve (AUPRC) of 0.58. In terms of the timely prediction of CA, 
the proposed model achieved an AUROC above 0.80 for predicting CA events up to 6 
hours in advance. The proposed method simultaneously improved precision and 
sensitivity to increase the AUPRC, which reduced the number of false alarms 
while maintaining high sensitivity. This result indicates that the predictive 
performance of the proposed model is superior to the performances of the models 
reported in previous studies. Next, we demonstrated the effect of feature 
importance on the clinical interpretability of the proposed method and inferred 
the effect between the non-CA and CA groups. Finally, external validation was 
performed using the eICU Collaborative Research Database, and an AUROC of 0.74 
and AUPRC of 0.44 were obtained in a general intensive care unit population.
CONCLUSIONS: The proposed framework can provide clinicians with more accurate CA 
prediction results and reduce false alarm rates through internal and external 
validation. In addition, clinically interpretable prediction results can 
facilitate clinician understanding. Furthermore, the similarity of vital sign 
changes can provide insights into temporal pattern changes in CA prediction in 
patients with heart failure-related diagnoses. Therefore, our system is 
sufficiently feasible for routine clinical use. In addition, regarding the 
proposed CA prediction system, a clinically mature application has been 
developed and verified in the future digital health field.

BACKGROUND: Congestive heart failure (CHF) demonstrates a heightened prevalence 
in individuals with diabetes mellitus within Intensive Care Units. The 
occurrence of abnormal chloride levels is frequently observed in critically ill 
patients, yet its clinical significance remains subject to debate. This study 
endeavors to explore the relationship between serum chloride levels and 
in-hospital mortality among patients affected by both congestive heart failure 
and diabetes.
METHODS: A retrospective cohort study was conducted, utilizing data from the 
Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care-IV (MIMIC-IV) database, focusing on 
adult patients in the United States. The impact of serum chloride levels upon 
ICU admission on in-hospital mortality was analyzed using multivariable logistic 
regression models, generalized additive models and subgroup analysis.
RESULTS: The study encompassed 7,063 patients with coexisting diabetes and 
congestive heart failure. The fully adjusted model revealed an inverse 
association between serum chloride levels and in-hospital mortality. As a 
tertile variable (Q3 vs Q1), the odds ratio (OR) was 0.73 with a 95% confidence 
interval (CI) of 0.54-0.98 (p = 0.039). As a continuous variable, per 1 mmol/L 
increment, the OR (95% CI) was 0.97 (0.96-0.99, p = 0.01). The relationship 
between serum chloride and in-hospital mortality demonstrated linearity 
(non-linear p = 0.958). Stratified analyses further validated the robustness of 
this correlation.
CONCLUSIONS: Serum chloride levels exhibited a negative association with 
in-hospital mortality in patients with both congestive heart failure and 
diabetes. Nevertheless, prospective, randomized, controlled studies are 
warranted to corroborate and validate the findings presented in this 
investigation.

OBJECTIVES: We aimed to develop an effective tool for predicting severe acute 
kidney injury (AKI) in patients admitted to the cardiac surgery recovery unit 
(CSRU).
DESIGN: A retrospective cohort study.
SETTING: Data were extracted from the Medical Information Mart for Intensive 
Care (MIMIC)-III database, consisting of critically ill participants between 
2001 and 2012 in the USA.
PARTICIPANTS: A total of 6271 patients admitted to the CSRU were enrolled from 
the MIMIC-III database.
PRIMARY AND SECONDARY OUTCOME: Stages 2-3 AKI.
RESULT: As identified by least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) 
and logistic regression, risk factors for AKI included age, sex, weight, 
respiratory rate, systolic blood pressure, diastolic blood pressure, central 
venous pressure, urine output, partial pressure of oxygen, sedative use, 
furosemide use, atrial fibrillation, congestive heart failure and left heart 
catheterisation, all of which were used to establish a clinical score. The areas 
under the receiver operating characteristic curve of the model were 0.779 (95% 
CI: 0.766 to 0.793) for the primary cohort and 0.778 (95% CI: 0.757 to 0.799) 
for the validation cohort. The calibration curves showed good agreement between 
the predictions and observations. Decision curve analysis demonstrated that the 
model could achieve a net benefit.
CONCLUSION: A clinical score built by using LASSO regression and logistic 
regression to screen multiple clinical risk factors was established to estimate 
the probability of severe AKI in CSRU patients. This may be an intuitive and 
practical tool for severe AKI prediction in the CSRU.

BACKGROUND: Red blood cell distribution width (RDW) to platelet ratio (RPR) is a 
novel inflammatory indicator. It integrates the risk prediction of RDW and 
platelet, which is associated with adverse outcomes. However, the predictive 
power of RPR in mortality for patients with acute myocardial infarction (AMI) 
remains uncertain. Thus, we aimed to explore the association between RPR and 
180-day in-hospital mortality in patients with AMI.
METHODS: Data on patients with AMI were extracted from the Medical Information 
Mart for Intensive Care IV (MIMIC-IV) database. Patients were divided into two 
groups according to the optimal RPR cut-off value. The survival curve between 
high and low RPR groups was plotted via the Kaplan-Meier (KM) method. Univariate 
and multivariate Cox regression analyses were performed to determine the 
association between RPR on admission and 180-day in-hospital mortality.
RESULTS: A total of 1266 patients were enrolled, of which 83 (6.8%) died within 
180 days during the hospitalization. Compared with the survivor group, the 
non-survivor group had higher RPR on admission (0.11 ± 0.07 vs. 0.08 ± 0.06, 
P < 0.001). The KM curve indicated that the survival probability of low RPR 
group was higher than that of high RPR group. Multivariate Cox regression 
analysis demonstrated that higher RPR on admission was an independent and 
effective predictor of 180-day mortality in patients with AMI (hazard ratio 
[HR]: 2.677, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.159-6.188, P = 0.021).
CONCLUSION: Higher RPR was associated with higher in-hospital 180-day mortality 
in patients with AMI.

BACKGROUND: This study aimed to explore the impact of hypoxic hepatitis (HH) on 
survival in heart failure (HF) patients and to develop an effective machine 
learning model to predict 30-day mortality risk in HF patients with HH.
METHODS: In the Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care (MIMIC)-III and IV 
databases, clinical data and survival situations of HF patients admitted to the 
intensive care unit (ICU) were retrospectively collected. Propensity Score 
Matching (PSM) analysis was used to balance baseline differences between HF 
patients with and without HH. Kaplan Meier analysis and multivariate Cox 
analysis were used to determining the effect of HH on the survival of CF 
patients. For developing a model that can predict 30-day mortality in CF 
patients with HH, the feature recurrence elimination (RFE) method was applied to 
feature selection, and seven machine learning algorithms were employed to model 
construction. After training and hyper-parameter optimization (HPO) of the model 
through cross-validation in the training set, a performance comparison was 
performed through internal and external validation. To interpret the optimal 
model, Shapley Additive Explanations (SHAP) were used along with the Local 
Interpretable Model-agnostic Explanations (LIME) and the Partial Dependence Plot 
(PDP) techniques.
RESULTS: The incidence of HH was 6.5% in HF patients in the MIMIC cohort. HF 
patients with HH had a 30-day mortality rate of 33% and a 1-year mortality rate 
of 51%, and HH was an independent risk factor for increased short-term and 
long-term mortality risk in HF patients. After RFE, 21 key features (21/56) were 
selected to build the model. Internal validation and external validation 
suggested that Categorical Boosting (Catboost) had a higher discriminatory 
capability than the other models (internal validation: AUC, 0.832; 95% CI, 
0.819-0.845; external validation: AUC, 0.757 95% CI, 0.739-0.776), and the 
simplified Catboost model (S-Catboost) also had good performance in both 
internal validation and external validation (internal validation: AUC, 0.801; 
95% CI, 0.787-0.813; external validation: AUC, 0.729, 95% CI, 0.711-0.745).
CONCLUSION: HH was associated with increased mortality in HF patients. Machine 
learning methods had good performance in identifying the 30-day mortality risk 
of HF with HH. With interpretability techniques, the transparency of machine 
learning models has been enhanced to facilitate user understanding of the 
prediction results.

BACKGROUND: There is no predictive tool for type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) 
patients with acute kidney injury (AKI). Our study aimed to establish an 
effective nomogram model for predicting mortality in T2DM patients with AKI.
METHOD: Data on T2DM patients with AKI were obtained from the Medical 
Information Mart for Intensive Care III. 70% and 30% of the patients were 
randomly selected as the training and validation cohorts, respectively. 
Univariate and multivariate logistic regression analyses were used to identify 
factors associated with death in T2DM patients with AKI. Factors significantly 
associated with survival outcomes were used to construct a nomogram predicting 
90-day mortality. The nomogram effect was evaluated by receiver operating 
characteristic curve analysis, Hosmer‒Lemeshow test, calibration curve, and 
decision curve analysis (DCA).
RESULTS: There were 4375 patients in the training cohort and 1879 in the 
validation cohort. Multivariate logistic regression analysis showed that age, 
BMI, chronic heart failure, coronary artery disease, malignancy, stages of AKI, 
white blood cell count, blood urea nitrogen, arterial partial pressure of oxygen 
and partial thromboplastin time were independent predictors of patient survival. 
The results showed that the nomogram had a higher area under the curve value 
than the sequential organ failure assessment score and simplified acute 
physiology score II. The Hosmer‒Lemeshow test and calibration curve suggested 
that the nomogram had a good calibration effect. The DCA curve showed that the 
nomogram model had good clinical application value.
CONCLUSION: The nomogram model accurately predicted 90-day mortality in T2DM 
patients with AKI. It may provide assistance for clinical decision-making and 
treatment, thereby reducing the medical burden.

BACKGROUND: The albumin-bilirubin (ALBI) score has demonstrated prognostic value 
in a range for liver and heart diseases. However, its association with all-cause 
mortality in intensive care unit (ICU) patients with heart failure remains 
uncertain.
OBJECTIVE: This study sought to investigate the relationship between the ALBI 
score and the risk of all-cause mortality in ICU patients with heart failure.
METHODS AND RESULTS: The ICU patients diagnosed with heart failure were selected 
from the Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care IV database (MIMIC-IV, 
version 2.2) and stratified into tertiles according to their ALBI scores. The 
primary outcome of interest was the occurrence of all-cause mortality within 365 
days post-discharge. The analysis encompassed a cohort of 4,239 patients, with 
Kaplan-Meier curves indicating that individuals with higher ALBI levels 
exhibited an elevated risk of all-cause mortality (log-rank p < 0.001). 
Multivariate adjusted Cox regression and subgroup analysis demonstrated that 
individuals in T2 (hazard ratio (HR) 1.09, 95% CI 0.99-1.21) and T3 (HR 1.17, 
95% CI 1.02-1.34) had an increased risk of mortality compared to individuals in 
T1 (p for trend < 0.001), and each incremental tertile in ALBI was linked to a 
10% rise in mortality risk, while each individual unit increase in ALBI was 
associated with a 36% increase in mortality risk. This relationship was 
consistently observed across most subgroups, except for using or not using 
inotropes or vasopressors, different ages, different creatinine levels. The 
restricted cubic spline (RCS) analysis indicated a linear relationship between 
ALBI levels and the risk of all-cause mortality.
CONCLUSION: The ALBI scores are independently associated with the risk of 
all-cause mortality in ICU patients with heart failure, particularly in those 
not using inotropes or vasopressors, younger patients, and with lower levels of 
creatinine. ALBI may help identify high-risk patients and optimize risk 
stratification in this population.

BACKGROUND: To evaluate the association between heart rate (HR) fluctuation and 
mortality in critically ill patients in the intensive care unit (ICU).
METHODS: A total of 27,814 patients were enrolled from the Medical Information 
Mart for Intensive Care database and were divided into 3 groups: low HR 
fluctuation [<25 beats per minute (bpm)], control (25-34 bpm), and high HR 
fluctuation (≥35 bpm), based on the initial 24-hour HR fluctuation (calculated 
as the maximum HR minus minimum HR). Multivariate Cox regression and restricted 
cubic spline models were used.
RESULTS: Compared to the control group, higher risk of 28-day and 1-year 
mortality remained significant in an adjusted model, with hazard ratios of 1.210 
[95% confidence interval (CI), 1.103-1.327] and 1.150 (95% CI, 1.078-1.227), 
respectively, in the high HR fluctuation group, as well as hazard ratios of 
1.130 (95% CI, 1.035-1.232) and 1.087 (95% CI, 1.022-1.157), respectively, in 
the low HR fluctuation group. Restricted cubic splines showed a U-type curve, 
with the lowest risk of mortality at an HR fluctuation of 30 bpm.
CONCLUSIONS: This retrospective cohort study revealed that both high and low HR 
fluctuation correlated with increased mortality in critically ill ICU patients, 
providing new insights for optimizing HR control strategies.

BACKGROUND: The serum albumin creatinine ratio (sACR) has been established as a 
potential indicator for heart disease, however, its relationship with prognosis 
in intensive care unit (ICU) patients with heart failure remains uncertain. This 
study aimed to investigate the association between sACR levels and all-cause 
mortality ICU patients with heart failure.
METHODS: Clinical data from MIMIC-Ⅳ database was utilized for the analysis of 
ICU patients with heart failure. Patients were categorized into quartiles 
(Q1-Q4) based on sACR levels. Kaplan-Meier survival analysis and multivariate 
adjusted Cox regression models were employed to assess the association between 
sACR levels and mortality outcomes within 365 days. Subgroup analysis was used 
to evaluate the prognostic impact of sACR across diverse populations. Restricted 
cubic spline curves and threshold effect analysis were utilized to quantify the 
dose-response relationship between sACR levels and risk of all-cause mortality. 
Mediating effects analysis was conducted to present the involvement of albumin 
and creatinine in the association between sACR and outcomes.
RESULTS: The analysis encompassed a cohort of 4,506 patients, with Kaplan-Meier 
curves indicating that individuals with lower sACR levels exhibited an elevated 
risk of all-cause mortality (log-rank p < 0.001). Multivariate adjusted Cox 
regression and subgroup analysis demonstrated that individuals in Q2 [hazard 
ratio (HR) 0.82, 95%CI 0.71∼0.96], Q3 (HR 0.76, 95%CI 0.64∼0.91) and Q4 (HR 
0.62, 95%CI 0.50∼0.76) had a decreased risk of mortality compared to individuals 
in Q1 (lower levels of sACR) (p for trend < 0.001), and this inverse 
relationship was consistently observed across various subgroups. Subsequent 
restricted cubic spline analysis revealed a negative yet nonlinear relationship 
between sACR and all-cause mortality (p for nonlinear < 0.001), and threshold 
effect analysis indicated an effect threshold of 3.75. Additionally, mediating 
effects analysis emphasized that sACR influenced the outcome not only through 
serum albumin and creatinine pathways, but also through direct mechanisms.
CONCLUSION: The study found that low levels of sACR were independently 
associated with an increased risk of one-year all-cause mortality in ICU 
patients with heart failure, with a threshold effect, which could potentially 
serve as an early warning indicator for high-risk populations.

PURPOSE: We aimed to investigate the relationship between the serum anion gap 
(AG) and all-cause mortality in patients with acute pancreatitis (AP) in 
intensive care units (ICUs).
PATIENTS AND METHODS: In this retrospective cohort analysis, data of patients 
with AP were extracted from the Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care 
database (version III). We collected the maximum serum AG value within the first 
24 hours of ICU admission. The main outcome was 90-day all-cause mortality. A 
multivariate Cox proportional hazard regression model was used to examine the 
association between the serum AG and mortality. The restricted cubic spline 
curve was used to confirm a non-linear relationship between serum AG values and 
mortality.
RESULTS: Of the 279 patients included in the study, 87 (31.18%) died. The serum 
AG value was positively associated with 90-day all-cause mortality (hazard ratio 
[HR] 1.08, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.02-1.14), after adjusting for age, 
sex, alcohol consumption, congestive heart failure, diabetes mellitus, 
hypertension, eGFR, albumin, and the SOFA score. There was a non-linear 
relationship between serum AG values and mortality after adjusting for potential 
confounders. We used a two-piecewise regression model to obtain a threshold 
inflection point value of 13.8 mmol/L. The HR and the 95% CI on the left 
inflection point were 0. 82 (0.61-1.09; p = 0.1719), and on the right inflection 
point were 1.15 (1.08-1.23; p < 0.0001).
CONCLUSION: The relationship between all-cause mortality in patients with acute 
pancreatitis and serum AG values was non-linear. All-cause mortality and serum 
AG values were positively correlated when the serum AG value was >13.8 mmol/L.

BACKGROUND: Hypoalbuminemia is common in congestive heart failure (CHF) 
patients. Serum albumin is associated with the prognosis of CHF patients. Impact 
of albumin infusion on prognosis of patients with CHF-hypoalbuminemia overlap 
remains unclear. We retrospectively investigated the impact of albumin infusion 
on prognosis of intensive care unit (ICU) patients with CHF-hypoalbuminemia 
overlap.
METHODS: We enrolled all patients whose diagnosis included CHF [ICD-9 
(international classification of diseases 9) code =428.0] at first ICU admission 
from the MIMIC III (Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care III) database, 
and excluded those with missing serum albumin values, with serum albumin >3.4 
g/dL or <18 years old. According to the exposure of albumin infusion during 
hospitalization, patients were stratified into non-albumin and albumin groups. 
Propensity-score matching (PSM) was performed (1:1 ratio) to control for 
baseline confounding. Outcome measures were in-hospital mortality as well as 
length of stay in the ICU (ICU LOS) and the hospital (hospital LOS).
RESULTS: There were 3,190 eligible patients in the initial search. Patients with 
albumin infusion had markedly higher in-hospital mortality (36.42% vs. 21.81%, 
P<0.001), longer ICU LOS [median 6.93 (3.39-14.82) vs. 3.84 (1.96-8.00) days, 
P<0.001], and longer hospital LOS [median 17.46 (11.45-28.33) vs. 10.92 
(6.81-18.00) days, P<0.001] than those without albumin infusion. The 
multivariate logistic regression analysis revealed that albumin infusion [odds 
ratio (OR), 1.509; 95% confidence interval (CI), 1.164-1.957; P=0.002] was 
significantly associated with increased risk of in-hospital mortality. After 
PSM, a cohort of 429 pairs of patients was included in the final analysis. 
Patients with albumin infusion had markedly higher in-hospital mortality (34.97% 
vs. 27.27%, P=0.015), longer ICU LOS [median 8.43 (4.33-16.28) vs. 6.43 
(3.07-13.66) days, P<0.001], and longer hospital LOS [median 16.92 (11.27-28.06) 
vs. 13.33 (8.00-21.10) days, P<0.001] than those without albumin infusion. The 
multivariate logistic regression analysis revealed that albumin infusion (OR, 
1.594; 95% CI, 1.143-2.223; P=0.006) was significantly associated with increased

CONCLUSIONS: Albumin infusion increased in-hospital mortality, ICU LOS, and 
hospital LOS in ICU patients with CHF-hypoalbuminemia overlap.

BACKGROUND: Blood urea nitrogen to albumin ratio (BAR) has been implicated in 
predicting outcomes of various inflammatory-related diseases. However, the 
predictive value of BAR in long-term mortality in patients with acute myocardial 
infarction (AMI) has not yet been evaluated.
METHODS: In this retrospective cohort study, the patients were recruited from 
the Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care III (MIMIC III) database and 
categorized into two groups by a cutoff value of BAR. Kaplan-Meier (K-M) 
analysis and Cox proportional hazard model were performed to determine the 
predictive value of BAR in long-term mortality following AMI. In order to adjust 
the baseline differences, a 1:1 propensity score matching (PSM) was carried out 
and the results were further validated.
RESULTS: A total of 1827 eligible patients were enrolled. The optimal cutoff 
value of BAR for four-year mortality was 7.83 mg/g. Patients in the high BAR 
group tended to have a longer intensive care unit (ICU) stay and a higher rate 
of one-, two-, three- and four-year mortality (all p<0.001) compared with those 
in the low BAR group. K-M curves indicated a significant difference in four-year 
survival (p<0.001) between low and high BAR groups. The Cox proportional hazards 
model showed that higher BAR (>7.83) was independently associated with increased 
four-year mortality in the entire cohort, with a hazard ratio (HR) of 1.478 [95% 
CI (1.254-1.740), p<0.001]. After PSM, the baseline characteristics of 312 pairs 
of patients in the high and low BAR groups were well balanced, and similar 
results were observed in K-M curve (p=0.003).
CONCLUSION: A higher BAR (>7.83) was associated with four-year mortality in 
patients with AMI. As an easily available biomarker, BAR can predict the 
long-term mortality in AMI patients independently.

BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Thrombocytopenia is common among sepsis patients. 
Platelet transfusions are frequently administered to increase platelet counts, 
but their clinical impacts remain unclear in sepsis-induced thrombocytopenia. 
The goal of this study was to explore the association between platelet 
transfusion and mortality in patients with sepsis-induced thrombocytopenia.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: The study was based on the Medical Information Mart for 
Intensive Care (MIMIC) III database. Septic patients with severe 
thrombocytopenia (a platelet count ≤ 50/nl) were included in the study and were 
divided into two groups: a platelet transfusion group (PT group) and a no 
platelet transfusion group (NPT group). The primary outcome was in-hospital 
mortality, and the secondary outcomes were the length of intensive care unit 
(ICU) stay (LOS-ICU) and 90-day mortality. Propensity score matching 
multivariable logistic regression was used to reduce the imbalance.
RESULTS: A total of 1733 patients were included: 296 patients were included in 
the PT group and 1437 patients were included in the NPT group. After propensity 
score matching, 296 paired patients constituted each group. Crude hospital 
mortality was significantly higher in the PT group than in the NPT group (145 
[48.99%] vs. 567 [39.46%], p = 0.002). In the extended multivariable logistic 
models for hospital mortality, the odds ratio (OR) of receiving a platelet 
transfusion was consistently significant in all six models (OR range, 
1.340-1.525, p < 0.05 for all). In the following subgroups, platelet transfusion 
was associated with increased in-hospital mortality: age > 60 years; sex: 
female; sequential organ failure assessment score ≤8; simplified acute 
physiology score ≤ 47; platelet count >29/nl and the complication of congestive 
heart failure. However, there were no significant differences in the 90-day 
mortality rate (170 [57.43%] vs. 741 [51.57%], p = 0.066) or the LOS-ICU (5.84 
[2.68-11.78] vs. 4.94 [2.18-12.72], p = 0.442) between the two groups. All these 
results remained stable after adjustment for confounders and in the comparisons 
after propensity score matching.
CONCLUSIONS: The propensity score-matched analysis showed that platelet 
transfusion was associated with increased in-hospital mortality in septic 
patients with severe thrombocytopenia (a platelet count ≤ 50/nl). However, it 
was not associated with 90-day mortality or the length of ICU stay.

BACKGROUND: The severity of sepsis is associated with systemic clotting 
activation. Atrial fibrillation (AF) is the most commonly observed arrhythmia in 
patients with sepsis and can lead to a poor prognosis. The aim of this study is 
to elucidate the association between oral anticoagulants and survival from 
septic patients complicated with AF.
METHODS: The data of 8,828 septic patients, including 2,955 AF and 5,873 without 
AF, were all originated from the Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care IV 
(MIMIC-IV) database. Patients with sepsis and AF are divided into OAC- group 
(n = 1,774) and OAC+ group (n = 1,181) based on OAC therapy. Septic patients 
with no AF were considered as the control group (n = 5,873, sepsis and no AF 
group). The main outcome endpoint was the survival rate of 30 day. The secondary 
outcome endpoint was the length of stay (LOS) from intensive care unit and 
hospital. Propensity score matching (PSM) was used to adjust the influence of 
superfluous factors, and a restricted mean survival time (RMST) analysis was 
used for calculating the benefit of survival time and survival rate. Analysis 
including univariate and multivariate logistic regression analysis was conducted 
to find prognosis-related predictors.
RESULTS: After PSM, the OAC+group had a higher 30-day survival rate compared to 
the OAC- group (81.59% vs. 58.10%; P < 0.001) in the ICU. Despite the higher 
survival, the hospital LOS (14.65 days vs. 16.66 days; P = 0.15) and ICU LOS 
(6.93 days vs. 5.92 days; P = 0.02) were prolonged at OAC+ group than OAC- 
group. No difference was found in survival rate of 30 day between the sepsis 
patients using warfarin and patients using NOAC (85.60% vs. 79.84%, P = 0.12). 
The sepsis patients using warfarin had a prolonged LOS in ICU and hospital 
compared with the sepsis patients using NOAC. In the vasopressor subgroup, 
patients who received NOAC therapy were associated with a reduced 30-day 
survival rate (73.57% vs. 84.03%; P = 0.04) and reduced LOS in ICU and hospital 
than those on warfarin therapy.
CONCLUSION: This study demonstrated that oral anticoagulants may increase the 
30-day survival rate of patients with sepsis and AF.

BACKGROUND: Acute kidney injury is common in patients with sepsis and 
contributes to poor prognosis and mortality. Early identification of high-risk 
patients can provide evidence for clinical decision-making.
METHODS: We developed a prediction model based on a cohort of 15,726 patients 
with sepsis from the Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care III critical 
care database. Logistic regression analysis was applied to develop a prediction 
model incorporating the selected risk factors. Discrimination and calibration of 
the prediction model were assessed using the C-index and calibration plot.
RESULTS: Risk factors in the prediction model included diabetes mellitus, 
chronic kidney disease, congestive heart failure, chronic liver disease, 
hyperbicarbonemia, hyperglycemia, low blood pH, prolonged clotting time, 
hypotension, and hyperlactatemia. The model showed great discrimination with a 
C-index of 0.711 (95% CI, 0.702-0.721) and appropriate calibration. A medium 
C-index value of 0.712 (95% CI, 0.697-0.727) could still be reached in the 
validation cohort. Negative and positive predictive values for the optimal 
cutoff value of ≥6 points were 56.8% and 72.3% in the training cohort and 57.3% 
and 72.6% in the validation cohort, respectively.
CONCLUSIONS: This prediction model allows clinicians to quickly assess the risk 
of sepsis-associated acute kidney injury (SA-AKI) at an early stage. 
Accordingly, clinicians can implement more medical measures that are considered 
beneficial to patients with sepsis.

BACKGROUND: Neutrophils and albumin had been shown to be independent predictors 
of mortality from various diseases. Purpose of this study was to investigate the 
effect of neutrophil-to-albumin ratio (NPAR) as an independent predictor of 
mortality in heart failure (HF) patients.
METHODS: Data were extracted from Medical Information Mart for Intensive 
Care-III database. Primary outcome was 30-day mortality, secondary outcomes were 
in-hospital, 90-day, 365-day mortality, length of stay (LOS) in hospital. Cox 
proportional hazards regression model and receiver operating characteristic 
(ROC) curve analysis and Pearson correlation analysis were used.
RESULTS: The HR (95% CI) values of the mid-tertile and the upper tertile were 
1.27 (1.01 to 1.59) and 2.29 (1.87 to 2.81) in 30-day mortality compared with 
the reference. The trend continued after adjusted for demographic and clinical 
variables. In the secondary outcomes were the same trends. The data of the 
Second Affiliated Hospital of Wenzhou Medical University showed the correlation 
coefficient between hospital LOS with NPAR.
CONCLUSION: NPAR was an independent factor of mortality in HF patients, which 
was correlated with hospital LOS. Our results need to be verified by prospective 
studies.

AIMS: There has been a lack of research examining the relationship between red 
cell distribution width (RDW) and the prognosis of cardiac arrest (CA) patients. 
The prognostic value of the changes in RDW during intensive care unit (ICU) 
hospitalization for CA patients has not been investigated. This study aims to 
investigate the correlation between RDW measures at ICU admission and RDW 
changes during ICU hospitalization and the prognosis of CA patients and then 
develop a nomogram that predicts the risk of mortality of these patients.
METHODS AND RESULTS: A retrospective cohort study is used to collect clinical 
characteristics of CA patients (>18 years) that are on their first admission to 
ICU with RDW data measured from the Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care 
IV Version 2.0 database. Patients are randomly divided into a development cohort 
(75%) and a validation cohort (25%). The primary outcome is 30 and 360 day 
all-cause mortality. ΔRDW is defined as the RDW on ICU discharge minus RDW on 
ICU admission. A multivariate Cox regression model is applied to test whether 
the RDW represents an independent risk factor that affects the all-cause 
mortality of these patients. Meanwhile, the dose-response relationship between 
the RDW and the mortality is described by restricted cubic spine (RCS). A 
prediction model is constructed using a nomogram, which is then assessed using 
receiver operating characteristic curves, calibration curves, and decision curve 
analysis (DCA). A total of 1278 adult CA patients are included in this study. We 
found that non-survivors have a higher level of RDW and ΔRDW compared with 
survivors, and the mortality rate is higher in the high RDW group than in the 
normal RDW group. The Kaplan-Meier survival curve indicates that patients in the 
normal RDW group had a higher cumulative survival rate at 30 and 360 days than 
those in the high RDW group (log-rank test, χ2  = 36.710, χ2  = 54.960, both P 
values <0.05). The multivariate Cox regression analysis shows that elevated RDW 
at ICU admission (>15.50%) is an independent predictor of 30 [hazard 
ratio = 1.451, 95% confidence interval (CI) = 1.181-1.782, P < 0.001] and 
360 day (hazard ratio = 1.393, 95% CI = 1.160-1.671, P < 0.001) all-cause 
mortality among CA patients, and an increase in RDW during ICU hospitalization 
(ΔRDW ≥ 0.4%) can serve as an independent predictor of mortality among these 
patients. A non-linear relationship between the RDW measured at ICU admission 
and the increased risk of mortality rate of these patients is shown by the RCS. 
This study established and validated a nomogram based on six variables, anion 
gap, first-day Sequential Organ Failure Assessment score, cerebrovascular 
disease, malignant tumour, norepinephrine use, and RDW, to predict mortality 
risk in CA patients. The consistency indices of 30 and 360 day mortality of CA 
patients in the validation cohort are 0.721 and 0.725, respectively. The 
nomogram proved to be well calibrated in the validation cohort. DCA curves 
indicated that the nomogram provided a higher net benefit over a wide, 
reasonable range of threshold probabilities for predicting mortality in CA 
patients and could be adapted for clinical decision-making.
CONCLUSIONS: Elevated RDW levels on ICU admission and rising RDW during ICU 
hospitalization are powerful predictors of all-cause mortality for CA patients 
at 30 and 360 days, and they can be used as potential clinical biomarkers to 
predict the bad prognosis of these patients. The newly developed nomogram, which 
includes RDW, demonstrates high efficacy in predicting the mortality of CA 
patients.

OBJECTIVES: Echocardiography is commonly used for hemodynamic assessment in 
sepsis, but data regarding its association with outcome are conflicting. The aim 
of this study was to evaluate the association between echocardiography and 
outcomes in patients with septic shock using the Medical Information Mart for 
Intensive Care IV database.
DESIGN: Retrospective cohort study comparing patients who did or did not undergo 
transthoracic echocardiography within the first 5 days of admission for the 
primary outcome of 28-day mortality.
SETTING: Admissions to the Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center intensive care 
from 2008 to 2019.
PATIENTS: Adults 16 years old or older with septic shock requiring vasopressor 
support within 48 hours of admission. Readmissions and patients admitted to the 
coronary care unit or cardiovascular intensive care were excluded, as well as 
patients with ST-elevation myocardial infarction or cardiac arrest.
INTERVENTIONS: None.
MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Echocardiography was performed in 1,515 (27%) of 
5,697 eligible admissions. The primary outcome was analyzed using a marginal 
structural model and rolling entry matching to adjust for baseline and 
time-varying confounders. Patients who underwent echocardiography showed no 
significant difference in 28-day mortality (adjusted hazard ratio 1.09; 95% CI, 
0.95-1.25; p = 0.24). This was consistent across multiple sensitivity analyses. 
Secondary outcomes were changes in management instituted within 4 hours of 
imaging. Treatment changes occurred in 493 patients (33%) compared with 431 
matched controls (29%), with the most common intervention being the 
administration of a fluid bolus.
CONCLUSIONS: Echocardiography in sepsis was not associated with a reduction in 
28-day mortality based on observational data. These findings do not negate the 
utility of echo in cases of diagnostic uncertainty or inadequate response to 
initial treatment.

BACKGROUND: Red blood cell distribution width (RDW) was a risk factor for poor 
prognosis in acute myocardial infarction (AMI). Recent reports suggested that 
combining RDW with other laboratory metrics could provide a better prediction. 
This retrospective study aimed to investigate whether the RDW-albumin ratio 
(RAR) may be associated with mortality after an AMI.
METHODS: This cohort study was conducted among adults (over 16 years old) with 
AMI in the Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care Database III V1.4 
(MIMIC-III). The primary outcome was 30-day mortality, and the secondary outcome 
was 1-year and 3-year mortality. Cox hazard regression model and Kaplan-Meier 
survival curves were constructed to estimate the effect of biomarkers on 
mortality. We used three models to adjust for potential bias. Receiver operating 
characteristic (ROC) curves and the area under the curve (AUC) were analyzed for 
the excellent performance of RAR on prognosis.
RESULTS: A total of 826 patients were eventually enrolled in our study. In 
multivariate analysis, RAR was found to be associated with 30-day mortality 
(Model 3: HR = 1.23, 95% CI = 1.09-1.39, P < .001). In addition, Subgroup 
analysis showed that the effect of RAR was higher in female patients than in 
male patients (P for interaction = .026). Kaplan-Meier survival curves showed 
that patients in the lower RAR quartile tended to have higher survival rates in 
the short and long term. AMI patients with RAR ≥ 4 had a 122% increase in 3-year 
mortality. Results of ROC and AUC showed that the prognostic performance of RAR 
for mortality was the best (30-day mortality: 0.703; 1-year mortality: 0.729; 
3-year mortality: 0.737).
CONCLUSIONS: RAR is a simple and stable predictor of prognosis in AMI patients. 
Our results support RAR = 4.0 as a criterion for prognostic risk stratification 
of AMI patients.

BACKGROUND: There are no universally accepted indications to initiate renal 
replacement therapy (RRT) among patients with acute kidney injury (AKI). This 
study aimed to develop a nomogram to predict the risk of RRT among AKI patients 
in intensive care unit (ICU).
METHODS: In this retrospective cohort study, we extracted AKI patients from 
Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care III (MIMIC-III) database. Patients 
were randomly divided into a training cohort (70%) and a validation cohort 
(30%). Multivariable logistic regression based on Akaike information criterion 
was used to establish the nomogram. The discrimination and calibration of the 
nomogram were evaluated by Harrell's concordance index (C-index) and 
Hosmer-Lemeshow (HL) test. Decision curve analysis (DCA) was performed to 
evaluate clinical application.
RESULTS: A total of 7413 critically ill patients with AKI were finally enrolled. 
514 (6.9%) patients received RRT after ICU admission. 5194 (70%) patients were 
in the training cohort and 2219 (30%) patients were in the validation cohort. 
Nine variables, namely, age, hemoglobin, creatinine, blood urea nitrogen and 
lactate at AKI detection, comorbidity of congestive heart failure, AKI stage, 
and vasopressor use were included in the nomogram. The predictive model 
demonstrated satisfying discrimination and calibration with C-index of 0.938 
(95% CI, 0.927-0.949; HL test, P = 0.430) in training set and 0.935 (95% CI, 
0.919-0.951; HL test, P = 0.392) in validation set. DCA showed a positive net 
benefit of our nomogram.
CONCLUSION: The nomogram developed in this study was highly accurate for RRT 
prediction with potential application value.

BACKGROUND: Anti-Embolism (AE) devices therapy is an additional antithrombotic 
treatment that is effective in many venous diseases, but the correlations 
between this medical compression therapy and cardiovascular arterial disease or 
comorbid diabetes mellitus (DM) are still controversial. In this study we 
investigated the association between compression therapy and intensive care unit 
(ICU) mortality in patients with a first acute myocardial infarction (AMI) 
diagnosis complicated with type II DM.
METHODS: This retrospective cohort study analyzed all patients with AMI and type 
II DM in the Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care-IV database. We 
extracted the demographics, vital signs, laboratory test results, comorbidities, 
and scoring system results of patients from the first 24 h after ICU admission. 
The outcomes of this study were 28-day mortality and ICU mortality. Analyses 
included Kaplan-Meier survival analysis, Cox proportional-hazards regression, 
and subgroup analysis.
RESULTS: The study included 985 eligible patients with AMI and type II DM, of 
who 293 and 692 were enrolled into the no-AE device therapy and AE device 
therapy groups, respectively. In the multivariate analysis, compared with no-AE 
device therapy, AE device therapy was a significant predictor of 28-day 
mortality (OR = 0.48, 95% CI = 0.24-0.96, P = 0.039) and ICU mortality (OR = 
0.50, 95% CI = 0.27-0.90, P = 0.021). In addition to age, gender and coronary 
artery bypass grafting surgery, there were no significant interactions of AE 
device therapy and other related risk factors with ICU mortality and 28-day 
mortality in the subgroup analysis.
CONCLUSIONS: Simple-AE-device therapy was associated with reduced risks of ICU 
mortality and 28-day mortality, as well as an improvement in the benefit on 
in-hospital survival in patients with AMI complicated with type II DM.

Individuals afflicted with heart failure complicated by sepsis often experience 
a surge in blood glucose levels, a phenomenon known as stress hyperglycemia. 
However, the correlation between this condition and overall mortality remains 
unclear. 869 individuals with heart failure complicated by sepsis were 
identified from the Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care-IV (MIMIC-IV) 
database and categorized into five cohorts based on their stress hyperglycemia 
ratio (SHR). The primary endpoints evaluated were mortality within the intensive 
care unit (ICU), all-cause mortality within 28 days, and all-cause mortality 
during hospitalization. Cox proportional hazards regression and restricted cubic 
spline analyses were employed to unravel the association between SHR and 
mortality. The ICU mortality, in-hospital mortality, and 28-day all-cause 
mortality were 10.01%, 13.69%, and 16.46%, respectively. Multivariable Cox 
proportional hazards regression analysis revealed a significant association 
between elevated SHR and all-cause mortality. After adjusting for confounding 
variables, elevated SHR was significantly associated with increased risk of ICU 
mortality (hazard ratio [HR] = 1.67; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.03-2.70)), 
in-hospital mortality (HR = 1.53; 95% CI, 1.00-2.33)), and 28-day all-cause 
mortality (HR = 1.49; 95% CI, 1.02-2.17)). Restricted cubic spline analysis 
demonstrated a significant U-shaped relationship between SHR and the risk of 
all-cause mortality. This study revealed that stress hyperglycemia ratio is an 
independent prognostic factor in patients with heart failure complicated by 
sepsis. Notably, both very high and very low SHR values were associated with 
increased mortality risk.

BACKGROUND: Cancer causes a serious health burden on patients worldwide. Chronic 
low-level inflammation plays a key role in tumorigenesis and prognosis. However, 
the role of the red blood cell distribution width (RDW)-to-albumin (RA) ratio in 
cancer mortality remains unclear.
METHODS: In this retrospective cohort study, we collected clinical information 
from cancer patients from the Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care III 
(MIMIC-III) version 1.4 database and then calculated RA by dividing RDW by 
albumin concentration. The primary outcome was 30 days mortality, while 
secondary outcomes were 90 days and 1 year mortality. Next, we adopted Cox 
regression models to calculate hazard ratios (HR) together with 95% confidence 
intervals (CI) for all-cause mortalities associated with the RA ratio.
RESULTS: For 30 days mortality, the HR (95% CI) for the high RA ratio (≥5.51) 
was 2.17 [95CI% (1.87-2.51); p = <0.0001], compared with the low RA ratio 
(<5.51). In Model 2, we adjusted sex and age and obtained HR (95% CI) of 2.17 
[95CI% (1.87-2.52); p = <0.0001] for the high RA ratio (≥5.51) group, compared 
to that in the low RA ratio (<5.51). In Model 3, adjusting for age, sex, anion 
gap, hematocrit, white blood cell count, congestive heart failure, SOFA, liver 
disease, and renal failure resulted in HR (95% CI) of 1.74 [95CI% (1.48-2.04); 
p = <0.0001] for the high RA ratio (≥5.51) relative to the low RA ratio (<5.51). 
We also analyzed common diseases in cancer patients but found no significant 
association.
CONCLUSION: To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study demonstrating 
that increased RA ratio is independently associated with increased all-cause 
mortality in cancer patients.

Changes in diastolic blood pressure (DBP) are common in patients with acute 
myocardial infarction (AMI). The relationship between the dynamic change of DBP 
and in-hospital mortality among patients with AMI remains unclear. This study 
aimed to explore the importance of DBP during disease development among patients 
with AMI. We performed a retrospective cohort study involving patients from the 
Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care III database, which included > 
40,000 patients admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU). Overall, 3209 adult 
AMI admissions were identified. We extracted the clinical and laboratory 
information in the patients with AMI. Cox proportional hazards models were used 
to evaluate the prognostic values of baseline DBP. We used the generalized 
additive mixed model (GAMM) to compare trends in DBP over time among survivors 
and non-survivors, after adjusting for potential confounders. During the ICU 
stay, 189 patients died (mortality rate, 6.36%). The age of each non-survivor 
together with the variations in DBP over time from admission to the time of 
death is of great importance to the scientific community. Cox multivariable 
regression analysis displayed that after adjusting for confounding factors, 
ascended baseline DBP was an important hazard factor for hospital deaths (hazard 
ratio, 1.02; 95% confidence interval, 1.01-1.03; P = .003). Based on GAMM, DBP 
in the death group was markedly lower than that of the surviving group. 
Moreover, the difference between the two groups showed an increasing trend 
within 3 days after ICU admission. After adjusting for various variables, the 
results were stable. DBP significantly contributed to in-hospital mortality 
among patients with AMI. There was a nonlinear correlation between baseline DBP 
and in-hospital mortality among patients with AMI, and the DBP of the 
non-survivors decreased within the first 3 days after ICU admission. However, 
the causality cannot be deduced from our data.

BACKGROUND: Whether there is a multiplicative interaction of lactate/albumin 
(L/A) ratio and geriatric nutritional risk index (GNRI) on the mortality of 
critically ill elderly patients with heart failure (HF) remains unclear.
HYPOTHESIS: To assess the interaction of L/A ratio and GNRI on the all-cause 
mortality in critically ill elderly patients with HF.
METHODS: This was a retrospective cohort study and data were extracted from the 
Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care III (MIMIC-III) database. The 
endpoints were 28-day and 1-year all-cause mortality, and the independent 
variables were L/A ratio and GNRI. The multiplicative interaction of L/A ratio 
and GNRI on the mortality was examined using Cox proportional-hazards model.
RESULTS: A total of 5627 patients were finally included. Results showed that 
patients with higher L/A ratio or GNRI ≤ 58 had higher risk of 28-day and 1-year 
all-cause mortality (all p < .01). We also found the significant multiplicative 
interaction effect between L/A ratio and GNRI score on the 28-day and 1-year 
all-cause mortality (both p < .05). The increased L/A ratio was associated with 
higher risk of 28-day and 1-year all-cause mortality in patients with GNRI ≤ 58 
than those with GNRI > 58.
CONCLUSIONS: There was a multiplicative interaction effect between L/A ratio and 
GNRI score on the mortality, and low GNRI score was associated with the 
increased risk of all-cause mortality with the increase of L/A ratio, suggesting 
the importance of nutrition-oriented intervention in critically ill elderly HF 
patients with high L/A ratio.

Cardiac arrest (CA) poses a significant global health challenge and often 
results in poor prognosis. We developed an interpretable and applicable machine 
learning (ML) model for predicting in-hospital mortality of CA patients who 
survived more than 72 h. A total of 721 patients were extracted from the Medical 
Information Mart for Intensive Care IV database, divided into the training set 
(n = 576) and the internal validation set (n = 145). The external validation set 
containing 856 cases were collected from four tertiary hospitals in Zhejiang 
Province. The primary outcome was in-hospital mortality. Eleven ML algorithms 
were utilized to establish prediction models based on data from 72 h after 
return of spontaneous circulation (ROSC). The results indicate that the CatBoost 
model exhibited the best performance at 72 h. Eleven variables were ultimately 
selected as key features by recursive feature elimination (RFE) to construct a 
compact model. The final model achieved the highest AUC of 0.86 (0.80, 0.92) in 
the internal validation and 0.76 (0.73, 0.79) in the external validation. SHAP 
summary plots and force plots visually explained the predicted outcomes. In 
conclusion, 72-h CatBoost showed promising performance in predicting in-hospital 
mortality of CA patients who survived more than 72 h. The model still requires 
further optimization and improvement.

Background: Urinary tract infection (UTI) is one of the common causes of sepsis. 
However, nomograms predicting the sepsis risk in UTI patients have not been 
comprehensively researched. The goal of this study was to establish and validate 
a nomogram to predict the probability of sepsis in UTI patients. Methods: 
Patients diagnosed with UTI were extracted from the Medical Information Mart for 
Intensive Care III database. These patients were randomly divided into training 
and validation cohorts. Independent prognostic factors for UTI patients were 
determined using forward stepwise logistic regression. A nomogram containing 
these factors was established to predict the sepsis incidence in UTI patients. 
The validity of our nomogram model was determined using multiple indicators, 
including the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC), 
correction curve, Hosmer-Lemeshow test, integrated discrimination improvement 
(IDI), net reclassification improvement (NRI), and decision-curve analysis 
(DCA). Results: This study included 6,551 UTI patients. Stepwise regression 
analysis revealed that the independent risk factors for sepsis in UTI patients 
were congestive heart failure, diabetes, liver disease, fluid electrolyte 
disorders, APSIII, neutrophils, lymphocytes, red blood cell distribution width, 
urinary protein, urinary blood, and microorganisms. The nomogram was then 
constructed and validated. The AUC, NRI, IDI and DCA of the nomogram all showed 
better performance than traditional APSIII score. The calibration curve and 
Hosmer-Lemeshow test results indicate that the nomogram was well-calibrated. 
Improved NRI and IDI values indicate that our nomogram scoring system is 
superior to other commonly used ICU scoring systems. The DCA curve indicates 
that the DCA map of the nomogram has good clinical application ability. 
Conclusion: This study identified the independent risk factors of sepsis in UTI 
patients and used them to construct a prediction model. The present findings may 
provide clinical reference information for preventing sepsis in UTI patients.

BACKGROUND: The purpose of this study was to develop a Nomogram model to 
identify the risk of all-cause mortality during hospitalization in patients with 
heart failure (HF).
METHODS: HF patients who had been registered in the Medical Information Mart for 
Intensive Care (MIMIC) III and IV databases were included. The primary outcome 
was the occurrence of all-cause mortality during hospitalization. Two Logistic 
Regression models (LR1 and LR2) were developed to predict in-hospital death for 
HF patients from the MIMIC-IV database. The MIMIC-III database were used for 
model validation. The area under the receiver operating characteristic curve 
(AUC) was used to compare the discrimination of each model. Calibration curve 
was used to assess the fit of each developed models. Decision curve analysis 
(DCA) was used to estimate the net benefit of the predictive model.
RESULTS: A total of 16,908 HF patients were finally enrolled through screening, 
of whom 2,283 (13.5%) presented with in-hospital death. Totally, 48 variables 
were included and analyzed in the univariate and multifactorial regression 
analysis. The AUCs for the LR1 and LR2 models in the test cohort were 0.751 (95% 
CI: 0.735∼0.767) and 0.766 (95% CI: 0.751-0.781), respectively. Both LR models 
performed well in the calibration curve and DCA process. Nomogram and online 
risk assessment system were used as visualization of predictive models.
CONCLUSION: A new risk prediction tool and an online risk assessment system were 
developed to predict mortality in HF patients, which performed well and might be 
used to guide clinical practice.

short-term dynamic changes in the prognosis of patients with acute heart failure 
(AHF) in the intensive care unit. Patients diagnosed with AHF in the medical 
information mart for intensive care III and their clinical data were 
retrospectively filtered. Patients were divided into survivor and non-survivor 
groups based on their prognosis during hospitalization, and differences in 
baseline data between groups were compared. Logistic regression models and 
restricted cubic spline (RCS) plots were performed to evaluate the relationship 
between baseline platelet counts and in-hospital mortality. Changes and trends 
in platelet counts were compared between the survivor and non-survivor groups 
after adjusting for confounders with the generalized additive mixing model 
(GAMM). A total of 2930 critical patients with acute heart failure were 
included, of which 2720 were survivors and 210 were non-survivors. Multiple 
logistic regression models revealed that baseline platelet count was an 
independent factor in hospital mortality (OR 0.997, 95% CI 0.994-0.999, 
P-value = 0.018). The RCS plot demonstrated a U-shaped dose-response 
relationship between baseline platelet count and in-hospital mortality. GAMM 
analysis suggested that the platelet counts decreased and then increased in the 
survivor group and gradually decreased in the non-survivor group, with a gradual 
increase of difference between two groups. After adjusting for confounders, the 
mean daily increase was -6.014 (95% CI -7.076-4.953, P-value < 0.001). Baseline 
platelet demonstrated a U-shaped dose-response relationship with adverse 
outcomes in critical patients with AHF. Early elevation of platelet was 
correlated with higher in-hospital mortality, indicating that tracking early 
changes in platelet might help determine the short-term prognosis of critical 
patients with AHF.

OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to develop and validate a nomogram for predicting 
28-day and 90-day mortality in intensive care unit (ICU) patients who have 
chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) coexisting with congestive heart 
failure (CHF).
METHODS: An extensive analysis was conducted on clinical data from the Medical 
Information Mart for Intensive Care IV database, covering patients over 18 years 
old with both COPD and CHF, who were were first-time ICU admissions between 2008 
and 2019. The least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) regression 
method was employed to screen clinical features, with the final model being 
optimized using backward stepwise regression guided by the Akaike Information 
Criterion (AIC) to construct the nomogram. The predictive model's discrimination 
and clinical applicability were evaluated via receiver operating characteristic 
(ROC) curves, calibration curves, the C-index, and decision curve analysi s 
(DCA).
RESULTS: This analysis was comprised of a total of 1948 patients. Patients were 
separated into developing and validation cohorts in a 7:3 ratio, with similar 
baseline characteristics between the two groups. The ICU mortality rates for the 
developing and verification cohorts were 20.8 % and 19.5 % at 28 days, 
respectively, and 29.4 % and 28.3 % at 90 days, respectively. The clinical 
characteristics retained by the backward stepwise regression include age, 
weight, systolic blood pressure (SBP), respiratory rate (RR), oxygen saturation 
(SpO2), red blood cell distribution width (RDW), lactate, partial thrombosis 
time (PTT), race, marital status, type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM), malignant 
cancer, acute kidney failure (AKF), pneumonia, immunosuppressive drugs, 
antiplatelet agents, vasoactive agents, acute physiology score III (APS III), 
Oxford acute severity of illness score (OASIS), and Charlson comorbidity index 
(CCI). We developed two separate models by assigning weighted scores to each 
independent risk factor: nomogram A excludes CCI but includes age, T2DM, and 
malignant cancer, while nomogram B includes only CCI, without age, T2DM, and 
malignant cancer. Based on the results of the AUC and C-index, this study 
selected nomogram A, which demonstrated better predictive performance, for 
subsequent validation. The calibration curve, C-index, and DCA results indicate 
that nomogram A has good accuracy in predicting short-term mortality and 
demonstrates better discriminative ability than commonly used clinical scoring 
systems, making it more suitable for clinical application.
CONCLUSION: The nomogram developed in this study offers an effective assessment 
of short-term mortality risk for ICU patients with COPD and CHF, proving to be a 
superior tool for predicting their short-term prognosis.

BACKGROUND: Cardiogenic shock (CS) is increasingly recognized as heterogeneous 
in its severity and response to therapies. This study aimed to identify CS 
phenotypes and their responses to the use of vasopressors.
METHOD: The current study included patients with CS complicating acute 
myocardial infarction (AMI) at the time of admission from the Medical 
Information Mart for Intensive Care IV (MIMIC-IV) database. Laboratory and 
clinical variables were collected and used to conduct latent profile (LPA) 
analysis. Furthermore, we used a multivariable logistic regression (LR) model to 
explore the independent association between the use of vasopressors and 
endpoints.
RESULT: A total of 630 eligible patients with CS after AMI were enrolled in the 
study. The LPA identified three profiles of CS: profile 1 (n = 259, 37.5%) was 
considered as the baseline group; profile 2 (n = 261, 37.8%) was characterized 
by advanced age, more comorbidities, and worse renal function; and profile 3 
(n = 170, 24.6%) was characterized by systemic inflammatory response syndrome 
(SIRS)-related indexes and acid-base balance disturbance. Profile 3 showed the 
highest all-cause in-hospital mortality rate (45.9%), followed by profile 2 
(43.3%), and profile 1 (16.6%). The LR analyses showed that the phenotype of CS 
was an independent prognostic factor for outcomes, and profiles 2 and 3 were 
significantly associated with a higher risk of in-hospital mortality (profile 2: 
odds ratio [OR] 3.95, 95% confidence interval [CI] 2.61-5.97, p < 0.001; profile 
3: OR 3.90, 95%CI 2.48-6.13, p < 0.001) compared with profile 1. Vasopressor use 
was associated with an improved risk of in-hospital mortality for profile 2 (OR: 
2.03, 95% CI: 1.15-3.60, p = 0.015) and profile 3 (OR: 2.91, 95% CI: 1.02-8.32, 
p = 0.047), respectively. The results of vasopressor use showed no significance 
for profile 1.
CONCLUSION: Three phenotypes of CS were identified, which showed different 
outcomes and responses to vasopressor use.

Serum chloride level has clinical significance in the prognosis of heart 
failure. Little is known regarding the association between serum chloride levels 
and in-hospital mortality in patients with heart failure.This retrospective 
study used clinical data obtained from the Medical Information Mart for 
Intensive Care Database. The study cohort comprised patients who were 
categorized on the basis of their serum chloride levels, and the primary 
endpoint was in-hospital mortality. To assess the impact of serum chloride 
levels at the time of intensive care unit admission on in-hospital mortality, we 
used various statistical approaches, including multivariable logistic regression 
models, a generalized additive model, and a two-piecewise linear regression 
model. In addition, subgroup analysis was conducted to examine the robustness of 
the main findings.This study comprised 15,983 participants. When compared with 
the reference group (Q5), the groups with the highest (Q7) and lowest (Q1) blood 
chloride levels exhibited increased in-hospital mortality, with fully adjusted 
odds ratios (ORs) of 1.36 [95% confidence interval (CI): 1.08-1.71] and 1.25 
(95% CI: 1-1.56), respectively. A U-shaped relationship was observed between 
blood chloride levels and in-hospital mortality, with the lowest risk observed 
at a threshold of 105.017 mmol/L. The effect sizes and corresponding CIs below 
and above the threshold were 0.969 (95% CI: 0.957-0.982) and 1.039 (95% CI: 
1.002-1.076), respectively. Stratified analyses demonstrated the robustness of 
this correlation.The relationship between serum chloride levels and in-hospital 
mortality in patients with heart failure was U-shaped, with an inﬂection point 
of 105.017 mmol/L.

BACKGROUND: Previous studies have shown that the frailty index based on 
laboratory tests (FI-Lab) can identify older adults at increased risk of adverse 
health outcomes. This study aimed to determine whether the FI-Lab is associated 
with mortality risk and can provide incremental improvements in risk 
stratification of patients with critical acute myocardial infarction (AMI).
MATERIALS AND METHODS: We conducted a secondary analysis of data from the 
Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care (MIMIC)-IV database. A 33-item 
FI-Lab was constructed. Outcomes of interest were in-hospital and 1-year 
mortality. Logistic regression models were used to investigate the association 
between the FI-Lab and outcomes. For the assessment of the incremental 
predictive value, the FI-Lab was added to several risk stratification scoring 
systems for critically ill patients, and the following indices were calculated: 
Δ C-statistic, integrated discrimination improvement (IDI), and net 
reclassification improvement (NRI).
RESULTS: Out of 2,159 patients, 477 died in hospital (22.1%), and 898 died 
during the 1-year follow-up period. After adjustment for confounders, the FI-Lab 
was associated with increased in-hospital mortality [odds ratio (OR) = 1.06, 95% 
confidence interval (CI): 1.05-1.07] and 1-year mortality (OR = 1.05, 95% CI: 
1.04-1.06) when assessed as a continuous variable (per 0.01-score increase). 
When assessed as a categorical variable, the FI-Lab was associated with 
in-hospital mortality (2nd Quartile: OR = 1.89, 95% CI: 1.18-3.03; 3rd Quartile: 
OR = 3.46, 95% CI: 2.20-5.46; and 4th Quartile: OR = 5.79, 95% CI: 3.61-9.28 
compared to 1st Quartile) as well as 1-year mortality (2nd Quartile: OR = 1.66, 
95% CI: 1.23-2.24; 3rd Quartile: OR = 2.40, 95% CI: 1.76-3.26; and 4th Quartile: 
OR = 3.76, 95% CI: 2.66-5.30 compared to 1st Quartile) after adjustment for 
confounders. The addition of the FI-Lab to all disease severity scores improved 
discrimination and significantly reclassified in-hospital and 1-year mortality 
risk.
CONCLUSION: The FI-Lab was a strong predictor of short- and long-term mortality 
in patients with critical AMI. The FI-Lab improved the ability to predict 
mortality in patients with critical AMI and therefore might be useful in the 
clinical decision-making process.

Association between short-term changes in serum magnesium and in-hospital 
mortality following acute myocardial infarction: a cohort study based on the 
MIMIC database.

Zhuang J, Zhang Q, Wang H, Su PH, Chen PY.

The association between short-term changes in serum magnesium level and risk of 
in-hospital mortality was investigated in patients with acute myocardial 
infarction (AMI). In this retrospective cohort study, data of 2,716 patients 
with AMI were extracted from the Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care 
(MIMIC-III and MIMIC-IV) database for 2001-2012. Univariate and multivariate Cox 
proportional hazards models were used to explore the association between serum 
magnesium level and short-term change and in-hospital mortality in patients with 
AMI. In addition, subgroups according to age, gender, Sequential Organ Failure 
Assessment (SOFA) score, and Simplified Acute Physiology Score (SAPS-II) were 
also analysed. In total, 504 (18.6%) patients died in hospital. After adjusting 
for covariates, all AMI patients with high magnesium levels at ICU admission 
(HR=1.03, 95% CI: 0.83-1.27) or 48 hours after ICU admission (all p<0.05), or 
those demonstrating a change in magnesium level within the first 48 hours of ICU 
stay (all p<0.05) were shown to have a high risk of in-hospital mortality. 
Moreover, this correlation was retained irrespective of age, gender, SOFA score, 
and SAPS-II (all p<0.05). Serum magnesium levels at different time points after 
ICU admission and change in serum magnesium level during the first 48 hours were 
associated with in-hospital mortality in patients with AMI, indicating that 
clinical attention should be paid to short-term changes in serum magnesium 
levels regarding treatment adjustment, which may further reduce the risk of 
mortality.

BACKGROUND: The role of intra-aortic balloon counterpulsation (IABP) in 
cardiogenic shock complicating acute myocardial infarction (AMI) is still a 
subject of intense debate. In this study, we aim to investigate the effect of 
IABP on the clinical outcomes of patients with AMI complicated by cardiogenic 
shock undergoing percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI).
METHODS: From the Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care (MIMIC)-IV 2.2, 
6017 AMI patients were subtracted, and 250 patients with AMI complicated by 
cardiogenic shock undergoing PCI were analyzed. In-hospital outcomes (death, 
24-hour urine volumes, length of ICU stays, and length of hospital stays) and 
1-year mortality were compared between IABP and control during the hospital 
course and 12-month follow-up.
RESULTS: An IABP was implanted in 30.8% (77/250) of patients with 
infarct-related cardiogenic shock undergoing PCI. IABP patients had higher 
levels of Troponin T (3.94 [0.73-11.85] ng/ml vs. 1.99 [0.55-5.75] ng/ml, 
p-value = 0.02). IABP patients have a longer length of ICU and hospital stays 
(124 [63-212] hours vs. 83 [43-163] hours, p-value = 0.005; 250 [128-435] hours 
vs. 170 [86-294] hours, p-value = 0.009). IABP use was not associated with lower 
in-hospital mortality (33.8% vs. 33.0%, p-value = 0.90) and increased 24-hour 
urine volumes (2100 [1455-3208] ml vs. 1915 [1110-2815] ml, p-value = 0.25). In 
addition, 1-year mortality was not different between the IABP and the control 
group (48.1% vs. 48.0%; hazard ratio 1.04, 95% CI 0.70-1.54, p-value = 0.851).
CONCLUSION: IABP may be associated with longer ICU and hospital stays but not 
better short-and long-term clinical prognosis.

BACKGROUND: For patients with multiple organ dysfunction syndrome (MODS), timely 
assessment of the condition and real-time adjustment of the treatment plan are 
of critical importance. To this end, transthoracic echocardiography (TTE) is 
widely used in clinical practice, but whether TTE can improve the short-term 
prognosis of MODS patients is currently unclear.
METHODS: We extracted data of patients from the Medical Information Mart for 
Intensive Care III (MIMIC-III) database and included cases according to 
inclusion and exclusion criteria. The primary endpoint was the mortality within 
28 days after admission to the intensive care unit (ICU), and multi-variate 
regression analysis was conducted to infer the risk factors associated death 
within 28 days after ICU admission. Double robust analysis was conducted to 
investigate the correlation between TTE and the endpoint. A gradient-boosted 
model (GBM) was constructed to calculate the propensity score (PS) of patients 
received TTE, so as to reduce the difference of variates between these two 
groups.
RESULTS: A total of 13,844 MODS cases were included and were divided into a TTE 
group and a non-TTE group. There were 5,022 cases (36.28%) in the TTE group, 
2,416 (48.10%) of whom were female; and 8,822 (63.72%) in the non-TTE group, 
4,129 of whom (46.80%) were female. The covariates that contributed 
significantly to PS included chronic heart failure (CHF), creatine kinase (CK), 
troponin, partial pressure of oxygen (PO2), and sequential organ failure 
assessment (SOFA) scores. Double robust analysis showed that within 28 days 
after ICU admission, the TTE group had lower risk of death when compared with 
the non-TTE group. The adjusted odds ratio (OR) value of TTE for 28 days death 
was 0.73 [95% confidence interval (CI): 0.65-0.82; P<0.001]. The other 3 models 
had similar results, suggesting that conduct TTE for patients with MODS in ICU 
was associated with lower risk of 28 days mortality.
CONCLUSIONS: TTE can reduce the mortality of MODS patients in the ICU.

PURPOSE: This study aims to explore the association between red cell index (RCI) 
and hospital mortality in Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD) patients 
in the intensive care unit.
PATIENTS AND METHODS: This was a retrospective cohort research. The study 
included 821 COPD patients. Clinical data from the Medical Information Mart for 
Intensive Care IV (MIMIC-IV) database was conducted. Multivariate logistic 
regression analysis was used to assess the correlation between RCI and 
in-hospital mortality. Age, SOFA score, diabetes mellitus, cerebrovascular 
disease, congestive heart failure and mechanical ventilation were considered for 
subgroup analysis.
RESULTS: This study comprised 821 patients, of which 16.5% (124/821) suffered 
hospital mortality. In the multivariate logistic regression model, RCI was 
positively associated with hospital mortality, each unit increase in RCI was 
associated with a 3% increase in hospital mortality (odds ratio [OR] =1.03; 95% 
confidence interval [95CI%] =1.01-1.06). Meanwhile, compare with the lowest RCI 
group, the highest RCI groups tended to have higher risks of hospital mortality 
(OR [95% CI] 2.33 [1.27-4.27]). Additionally, subgroup analysis result was 
persistent among all the groups.
CONCLUSION: Higher RCI was positively associated with a higher risk of mortality 
in critically ill patients with COPD. Further investigation is necessary to 
confirm these findings.

Background Atrial fibrillation (AFIB) is a common atrial arrhythmia that affects 
millions of people worldwide. However, most of the time, AFIB is paroxysmal and 
can pass unnoticed in medical exams; therefore, regular screening is required. 
This paper proposes machine learning (ML) methods to detect AFIB from short-term 
electrocardiogram (ECG) and photoplethysmography (PPG) signals. Aim Several 
experiments were conducted across five different databases, with three of them 
containing ECG signals and the other two consisting of only PPG signals. 
Experiments were conducted to investigate the hypothesis that an ML model 
trained to predict AFIB from ECG segments could be used to predict AFIB from PPG 
segments. Materials and methods A random forest (RF) ML algorithm achieved the 
best accuracy and achieved a 90% accuracy rate on the University of Mississippi 
Medical Center (UMMC) dataset (216 samples) and a 97% accuracy rate on the 
Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care (MIMIC)-III datasets (2,134 
samples). Results A total of 269,842 signal segments were analyzed across all 
datasets (212,266 were of normal sinus rhythm (NSR) and 57,576 corresponded to 
AFIB segments). Conclusions The ability to detect AFIB with significant accuracy 
using ML algorithms from PPG signals, which can be acquired via non-invasive 
contact or contactless, is a promising step forward toward the goal of achieving 
large-scale screening for AFIB.

AIMS: Serum calcium level is widely used for evaluating disease severity, but 
its impact on clinical outcomes in patients with congestive heart failure (CHF) 
remains poorly understood. The aim of this study is to investigate the 
relationship between serum calcium levels and in-hospital mortality in CHF 
patients.
METHODS AND RESULTS: We conducted a retrospective analysis utilizing clinical 
data from the Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care database, encompassing 
a cohort of 15 983 CHF patients. This cohort was stratified based on their serum 
calcium levels, with the primary objective being the determination of 
in-hospital mortality. To assess the impact of admission serum calcium levels on 
in-hospital mortality, we employed various statistical methodologies, including 
multivariable logistic regression models, a generalized additive model, a 
two-piecewise linear regression model, and subgroup analysis. Comparative 
analysis of the reference group (Q3) revealed increased in-hospital mortality in 
the first quintile (Q1, the group with the lowest blood calcium level) and the 
fifth quintile (Q5, the group with the highest blood calcium level), with fully 
adjusted odds ratios of 1.38 [95% confidence interval (CI): 1.13-1.68, 
P = 0.002] and 1.23 (95% CI: 1.01-1.5, P = 0.038), respectively. A U-shaped 
relationship was observed between serum calcium levels and in-hospital 
mortality, with the lowest risk occurring at a threshold of 8.35 mg/dL. The 
effect sizes and corresponding CIs below and above this threshold were 0.782 
(95% CI: 0.667-0.915, P = 0.0023) and 1.147 (95% CI: 1.034-1.273, P = 0.0094), 
respectively. Stratified analyses confirmed the robustness of this correlation.
CONCLUSIONS: Our study identifies a U-shaped association between serum calcium 
levels and in-hospital mortality in CHF patients, with a notable inflection 
point at 8.35 mg/dL. Further investigation through prospective, randomized, and 
controlled studies is warranted to validate the findings presented in this 
study.

PURPOSE: Coagulation disorder in congestive heart failure (CHF) has been 
well-documented. The prognostic value of a composite coagulation disorder score, 
which combines the absolute platelet count, international normalized ratio 
(INR), and activated partial thromboplastin time (APTT), has not been assessed 
in CHF. The present study endeavored to explore the association between the 
coagulation disorder score and adverse outcomes of critically ill patients with 
CHF.
METHODS: Patients diagnosed with CHF in the Medical Information Mart for 
Intensive Care III (MIMIC-III) database were included in the present 
retrospective cohort study. The coagulation disorder score was calculated 
according to the abnormalities of the absolute platelet count, INR, and APTT 
within 24 h after intensive care unit admission. The primary outcomes were the 
short-term all-cause mortality, including 30-, 90-day and in-hospital 
mortalities. The Kaplan-Meier (K-M) survival curve and the Cox proportional 
hazard model were performed to assess the correlation between coagulation 
disorder score and outcome events.
RESULTS: A total of 6,895 patients were enrolled in this study and divided into 
four groups according to the coagulation disorder score. K-M survival curve 
preliminarily indicated that subjects with higher coagulation disorder score 
presented lower survival rate and shorter survival time. After adjustment for 
potential confounders, the multivariate Cox analysis further illustrated that 
elevated coagulation disorder score as a quartile variable was significantly 
associated with increased all-cause mortality (quartile 4 vs. quartile 1, 
30-day: HR [95% CI], 1.98 [1.50, 2.62], 90-day: HR [95% CI], 1.88 [1.49, 2.37], 
in-hospital: HR [95%CI], 1.93 [1.42, 2.61]).
CONCLUSION: In critically ill patients with CHF, ones with high coagulation 
disorder score tend to be worse clinical prognosis, which would be a promising 
biomarker and helpful for the management of CHF patients.

This paper targets a major challenge of how to effectively allocate medical 
resources in intensive care units (ICUs). We trained multiple regression models 
using the Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care III (MIMIC III) database 
recorded in the period between 2001 and 2012. The training and validation 
dataset included pneumonia, sepsis, congestive heart failure, hypotension, chest 
pain, coronary artery disease, fever, respiratory failure, acute coronary 
syndrome, shortness of breath, seizure and transient ischemic attack, and aortic 
stenosis patients' recorded data. Then we tested the models on the unseen data 
of patients diagnosed with coronary artery disease, congestive heart failure or 
acute coronary syndrome. We included the admission characteristics, clinical 
prescriptions, physiological measurements, and discharge characteristics of 
those patients. We assessed the models' performance using mean residuals and 
running times as metrics. We ran multiple experiments to study the data 
partition's impact on the learning phase. The total running time of our 
best-evaluated model is 123,450.9 mS. The best model gives an average accuracy 
of 98%, highlighting the location of discharge, initial diagnosis, location of 
admission, drug therapy, length of stay and internal transfers as the most 
influencing patterns to decide a patient's readiness for discharge.

BACKGROUND: To investigate the association between serum osmolality and 
deteriorating renal function in patients with acute myocardial infarction (AMI).
METHODS: Three thousand eight hundred eighty-five AMI patients from the Medical 
Information Mart for Intensive Care IV were enrolled for this study. The primary 
outcome was deteriorating renal function. Secondary outcomes included the 
new-onset of acute kidney injury (AKI) and progress of AKI. < 293.2725 mmol/L 
was defined as low serum osmolality, and ≥ 293.2725 mmol/L as high serum 
osmolality based on upper quartile. Univariate and multivariate logistic 
regression models were used to explore the associations between serum osmolality 
and the development of deteriorating renal function, the new-onset of AKI and 
progress of AKI among AMI patients. Subgroup analysis was also conducted.
RESULTS: One thousand three hundred ninety-three AMI patients developed 
deteriorating renal function. After adjusting all confounding factors, high 
serum osmolality was associated with increased risk of deteriorating renal 
function [odds ratio (OR) = 1.47, 95% confidence interval (CI): 1.22-1.78], 
new-onset of AKI (OR = 1.31, 95% CI: 1.01-1.69), and progress of AKI risk 
(OR = 1.26, 95% CI: 1.01-1.59) among AMI patients. In addition, when the 
stratified analysis was performed for age, AMI type, cardiogenic shock, and 
estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR), high serum osmolality was risk 
factor for the risk of deteriorating renal function among patients aged 65 years 
or older, without cardiogenic shock, and with an eGFR ≥ 60 mL/min/1.73m2.
CONCLUSION: Higher serum osmolality increased the risk of deteriorating renal 
function among AMI patients.

OBJECTIVES: We aimed to develop and validate a prognostic nomogram and evaluate 
the discrimination of the nomogram model in order to improve the prediction of 
30-day survival of critically ill myocardial infarction (MI) patients.
DESIGN: A retrospective cohort study.
SETTING: Data were collected from the Medical Information Mart for Intensive 
Care (MIMIC)-III database, consisting of critically ill participants between 
2001 and 2012 in the USA.
PARTICIPANTS: A total of 2031 adult critically ill patients with MI were 
enrolled from the MIMIC-III database.
PRIMARY AND SECONDARY OUTCOME: Thirty-day survival.
RESULTS: Independent prognostic factors, including age, heart rate, white blood 
cell count, blood urea nitrogen and bicarbonate, were identified by Cox 
regression model and used in the nomogram. Good agreement between the prediction 
and observation was indicated by the calibration curve for 30-day survival. The 
nomogram exhibited reasonably accurate discrimination (area under the receiver 
operating characteristic curve, 0.765, 95% CI, 0.716 to 0.814) and calibration 
(C-index, 0.758, 95% CI, 0.712 to 0.804) in the validation cohort. Decision 
curve analysis demonstrated that the nomogram was clinically beneficial. 
Additionally, participants could be classified into two risk groups by the 
nomogram, and the 30-day survival probability was significantly different 
between them (p<0.001).
CONCLUSION: This five-factor nomogram can achieve a reasonable degree of 
accuracy to predict 30-day survival in critically ill MI patients and might be 
helpful for risk stratification and decision-making for MI patients.

Background: Patients with myocardial infarction (MI) in intensive care units 
(ICU) are at high risk of death. Whether treatment with ondansetron (OND) at an 
early stage plays a protective role in critically ill patients with MI and its 
underlying mechanism remains unclear. Methods: A total of 4486 patients with MI 
were enrolled in the study cohort from the Medical Information Mart for 
Intensive Care IV (MIMIC-IV) database and divided into OND-medication groups or 
not. Propensity score matching (PSM) and regression analysis were performed to 
investigate the effect of OND on patients, accompanied by sensitivity analysis 
to evaluate the robustness of the results. Integrated with causal mediation 
analysis (CMA), we investigated the potential causal pathway mediated by the 
palate-to-lymphocyte ratio (PLR) between early OND treatment and clinical 
outcomes. Results: Among patients with MI, 976 of them were treated with OND at 
the early stage while 3510 patients were not. The all-cause in-hospital 
mortality rate was significantly lower in the OND-medication group (5.6% vs 
7.7%), accompanied by lower 28-day mortality (7.8% vs 11.3%) and 90-day 
mortality (9.2% vs 13.1%) rates. PSM analysis further confirmed the results for 
in-hospital mortality (5.7% vs 8.0%), 28-day mortality (7.8% vs 10.8%), and 
90-day mortality (9.2% vs 12.5%). After adjusting for confounders, multivariate 
logistic regression analysis revealed that OND was associated with decreased 
in-hospital mortality (OR = 0.67, 95% CI: 0.49-0.91), and Cox regression 
confirmed the results for 28-day mortality and 90-day mortality with HR = 0.71 
and 0.73, respectively. Most importantly, CMA demonstrated that the protective 
effect of OND on patients with MI was mediated by its anti-inflammatory effect 
through the regulation of PLR. Conclusion: Early use of OND in critically ill 
patients with MI may exert protective effects by reducing in-hospital mortality 
and 28- and 90-day mortality. The beneficial effects of OND on these patients 
were exerted through anti-inflammatory effects, at least in part.

BACKGROUND: The study set out to develop an accurate and clinically valuable 
prognostic nomogram to assess the risk of in-hospital death in patients with 
acute decompensated chronic heart failure (ADCHF) and diabetes.
METHODS: We extracted clinical data of patients diagnosed with ADCHF and 
diabetes from the Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care III database. Risk 
variables were selected utilizing least absolute shrinkage and selection 
operator regression analysis, and were included in multivariate logistic 
regression and presented in nomogram. bootstrap was used for internal 
validation. The discriminative power and predictive accuracy of the nomogram 
were estimated using the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve 
(AUC), calibration curve and decision curve analysis (DCA).
RESULTS: Among 867 patients with ADCHF and diabetes, In-hospital death occurred 
in 81 (9.3%) patients. Age, heart rate, systolic blood pressure, red blood cell 
distribution width, shock, β-blockers, angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors 
or angiotensin receptor blockers, assisted ventilation, and blood urea nitrogen 
were brought into the nomogram model. The calibration curves suggested that the 
nomogram was well calibrated. The AUC of the nomogram was 0.873 (95% CI: 
0.834-0.911), which was higher that of the Simplified Acute Physiology Score II 
[0.761 (95% CI: 0.711-0.810)] and sequential organ failure assessment score 
[0.699 (95% CI: 0.642-0.756)], and Guidelines-Heart Failure score [0.782 (95% 
CI: 0.731-0.835)], indicating that the nomogram had better ability to predict 
in-hospital mortality. In addition, the internally validated C-index was 0.857 
(95% CI: 0.825-0.891), which again verified the validity of this model.
CONCLUSIONS: This study constructed a simple and accurate nomogram for 
predicting in-hospital mortality in patients with ADCHF and diabetes, especially 
in those who admitted to the intensive care unit for more than 48 hours, which 
contributed clinicians to assess the risk and individualize the treatment of 
patients, thereby reducing in-hospital mortality.

BACKGROUND: The harmful effect of diabetes mellitus (DM) on mortality in 
patients with acute myocardial infarction (AMI) remains controversial. 
Furthermore, few studies focused on critical AMI patients. We aimed to address 
whether DM increases short- and long-term mortality in this specific population.
METHODS: We analyzed AMI patients admitted into coronary care unit (CCU) with 
follow-up of ≥1 year from two cohorts (MIMIC-III, Medical Information Mart for 
Intensive Care III; CIN, Cardiorenal ImprovemeNt Registry) in the United States 
and China. Main outcome was mortality at 30-day and 1-year following 
hospitalization. Kaplan-Meier curves and Cox proportional hazards models were 
constructed to examine the impact of DM on mortality in critical AMI patients.
RESULTS: 1774 critical AMI patients (mean age 69.3 ± 14.3 years, 46.1% had DM) 
were included from MIMIC-III and 3380 from the CIN cohort (mean age 62.2 ± 12.2 
years, 29.3% had DM). In both cohorts, DM group was older and more prevalent in 
cardio-renal dysfunction than non-DM group. Controlling for confounders, DM 
group has a significantly higher 30-day mortality (adjusted odds ratio (aOR) 
(95% CI): 2.71 (1.99-3.73) in MIMIC-III; aOR (95% CI): 9.89 (5.81-17.87) in 
CIN), and increased 1-year mortality (adjusted hazard ratio (aHR) (95% CI): 1.91 
(1.56-2.35) in MIMIC-III; aHR (95% CI): 2.62(1.99-3.45) in CIN) than non-DM 
group.
CONCLUSIONS: Taking into account cardio-renal function, critical AMI patients 
with DM have a higher 30-day mortality and 1-year mortality than non-DM group in 
both cohorts. Further studies on prevention and management strategies for DM are 
needed for this population.

BACKGROUND: Elevated red blood cell distribution width (RDW) levels are strongly 
associated with an increased risk of mortality in patients with congestive heart 
failure (CHF). Additionally, heart failure has been closely linked to diabetes. 
Nevertheless, the relationship between RDW and in-hospital mortality in the 
intensive care unit (ICU) among patients with both congestive heart failure 
(CHF) and diabetes mellitus (DM) remains uncertain.
METHODS: This retrospective study utilized data from the Medical Information 
Mart for Intensive Care IV (MIMIC-IV) database, a comprehensive critical care 
repository. RDW was assessed as both continuous and categorical variables. The 
primary outcome of the study was in-hospital mortality at the time of hospital 
discharge. We examined the association between RDW on ICU admission and 
in-hospital mortality using multivariable logistic regression models, restricted 
cubic spline analysis, and subgroup analysis.
RESULTS: The cohort consisted of 7,063 patients with both DM and CHF (3,135 
females and 3,928 males). After adjusting for potential confounders, we found an 
association between a 9% increase in mortality rate and a 1 g/L increase in RDW 
level (OR = 1.09; 95% CI, 1.05∼1.13), which was associated with 11 and 58% 
increases in mortality rates in Q2 (OR = 1.11, 95% CI: 0.87∼1.43) and Q3 
(OR = 1.58, 95% CI: 1.22∼2.04), respectively, compared with that in Q1. 
Moreover, we observed a significant linear association between RDW and 
in-hospital mortality, along with strong stratified analyses to support the 
findings.
CONCLUSIONS: Our findings establish a positive association between RDW and 
in-hospital mortality in patients with DM and CHF.

Background: Acute heart failure (AHF) is a severe clinical syndrome 
characterized as rapid onset or worsening of symptoms of chronic heart failure 
(CHF). Risk stratification for patients with AHF in the intensive care unit 
(ICU) may help clinicians to predict the 28-day mortality risk in this 
subpopulation and further raise the quality of care. Methods: We retrospectively 
reviewed and analyzed the demographic characteristics and serological indicators 
of patients with AHF in the Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care III 
(MIMIC III) (version 1.4) between June 2001 and October 2012 and our medical 
center between January 2019 and April 2021. The chi-squared test and the 
Fisher's exact test were used for comparison of qualitative variables among the 
AHF death group and non-death group. The clinical variables were selected by 
using the least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) regression. A 
clinical nomogram for predicting the 28-day mortality was constructed based on 
the multivariate Cox proportional hazard regression analysis and further 
validated by the internal and external cohorts. Results: Age > 65 years [hazard 
ratio (HR) = 2.47], the high Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (SOFA) score 
(≥3 and ≤8, HR = 2.21; ≥9 and ≤20, HR = 3.29), lactic acid (Lac) (>2 mmol/l, HR 
= 1.40), bicarbonate ( HCO3- ) (>28 mmol/l, HR = 1.59), blood urea nitrogen 
(BUN) (>21 mg/dl, HR = 1.75), albumin (<3.5 g/dl, HR = 2.02), troponin T (TnT) 
(>0.04 ng/ml, HR = 4.02), and creatine kinase-MB (CK-MB) (>5 ng/ml, HR = 1.64) 
were the independent risk factors for predicting 28-day mortality of intensive 
care patients with AHF (p < 0.05). The novel nomogram was developed and 
validated with a promising C-index of 0.814 (95% CI: 0.754-0.882), 0.820 (95% 
CI: 0.721-0.897), and 0.828 (95% CI: 0.743-0.917), respectively. Conclusion: 
This study provides a new insight in early predicting the risk of 28-day 
mortality in intensive care patients with AHF. The age, the SOFA score, and 
serum TnT level are the leading three predictors in evaluating the short-term 
outcome of intensive care patients with AHF. Based on the nomogram, clinicians 
could better stratify patients with AHF at high risk and make adequate treatment 
plans.

The relationship between three scoring systems (LODS, OASIS, and SAPS II) and 
in-hospital mortality of intensive care patients with ST segment elevation 
myocardial infarction (STEMI) is currently inconclusive. The baseline data, LODS 
score, OASIS score, SAPS II score, and in-hospital prognosis of intensive care 
patients with STEMI were retrieved from the Medical Information Mart for 
Intensive Care IV database. Propensity score matching analysis was performed to 
reduce bias. Receiver operating characteristic curves (ROC) were drawn for the 
three scoring systems, and comparisons between the areas under the ROC curves 
(AUC) were conducted. Decision curve analysis (DCA) was performed to determine 
the net benefits of the three scoring systems. LODS and SAPS II were independent 
risk factors for in-hospital mortality. For the study cohort, the AUCs of LODS, 
OASIS, SAPS II were 0.867, 0.827, and 0.894; after PSM, the AUCs of LODS, OASIS, 
SAPS II were 0.877, 0.821, and 0.881. A stratified analysis of the patients who 
underwent percutaneous coronary intervention/coronary artery bypass grafting 
(PCI/CABG) or not was conducted. In the PCI/CABG group, the AUCs of LODS, OASIS, 
SAPS II were 0.853, 0.825, and 0.867, while in the non-PCI/CABG group, the AUCs 
of LODS, OASIS, SAPS II were 0.857, 0.804, and 0.897. The results of the Z test 
suggest that the predictive value of LODS and SAPS II was not statistically 
different, but both were higher than OASIS. According to the DCA, the net 
clinical benefit of LODS was the greatest. LODS and SAPS II have excellent 
predictive value, and in most cases, both were higher than OASIS. With a more 
concise composition and greater clinical benefit, LODS may be a better predictor 
of in-hospital mortality for intensive care patients with STEMI.

BACKGROUND: Hypochloremia and red blood cell distribution width (RDW) play 
important roles in congestive heart failure (CHF) pathophysiology, and they were 
associated with the prognosis of CHF. However, the prognostic value of chloride 
combined with RDW in patients with CHF remains unknown.
METHODS: We retrospectively analyzed critically ill patients with CHF. The 
database was derived from the Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care IV 
v2.0 (MIMIC-IV-v2.0) database.
RESULTS: In the final analysis, 5376 critically ill patients with CHF were 
included, and 2428 patients (45.2 %) experienced 5-year mortality. The 
restricted cubic spline model revealed a positive correlation between RDW and 
5-year mortality, whereas chloride showed a U-shaped correlation with 5-year 
mortality. The median values of RDW and chloride were used to classify patients 
into four groups: high chloride/low RDW, low chloride/low RDW, high 
chloride/high RDW, and low chloride/high RDW. We observed the prognostic value 
of RDW combined with chloride in the Cox proportional hazard model, in 
predicting 5-year mortality, in-hospital mortality and 1-year mortality. 
Furthermore, we discovered that patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD) had a 
higher 5-year mortality risk than patients without CKD.
CONCLUSION: We found the translational potential role of chloride combined with 
RDW in prioritizing patients at high risk for short- and long-term mortality in 
a cohort of critically ill patients with CHF. Prospective multicenter 
investigations are warranted to validate our results.

Objective To analyze the risk factors of septic cardiomyopathy (SC),and to 
construct and evaluate the risk prediction model of SC. Methods The clinical 
data of patients with sepsis were extracted from MIMIC-Ⅳ database and randomized 
into a training set and a validation set at a ratio of 7 to 3.According to the 
presence or absence of SC,the patients were assigned into SC and non-SC 
groups.The independent risk factors of SC were determined by univariate and 
multivariate Logistic regression analysis,and a risk prediction model and a 
nomogram were established.The area under the receiver operating characteristic 
curve (AUC),calibration curve,and decision curve analysis (DCA) were employed to 
evaluate the distinguishing degree,calibration,and clinical applicability of the 
model,respectively. Results A total of 2628 sepsis patients were enrolled in 
this study,including 1865 patients in the training set and 763 patients in the 
validation set.There was no significant difference in the incidence of SC 
between the training set and the validation set (58.98% vs. 
62.25%,P=0.120).Except chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (P=0.015) and 
length of stay in intensive care unit (P=0.016),there was no significant 
difference in other clinical indicators between the two groups (all 
P>0.05).Logistic regression analysis showed that coronary heart disease 
(P=0.028),heart failure (P<0.001),increased neutrophil count (P=0.001),decreased 
lymphocyte count (P=0.036),increased creatine kinase isoenzyme (P<0.001),and 
increased blood urea nitrogen (P=0.042) were independent risk factors for SC.The 
AUC of the nomogram prediction model in the training set and validation set was 
0.759 (95% CI=0.732-0.785) and 0.765 (95% CI=0.723-0.807),respectively.The 
established model showcased good fitting degrees in both data sets (training 
set:P=0.075;validation set:P=0.067).The DCA results showed that the nomogram 
prediction model had good clinical applicability. Conclusion The nomogram 
prediction model based on basic diseases and clinical biochemical indicators can 
effectively predict the risk of SC occurrence.

Background: Patients with acute heart failure (AHF) who require continuous renal 
replacement therapy (CRRT) have a high risk of in-hospital mortality. It is 
clinically important to screen high-risk patients using a model or scoring 
system. This study aimed to develop and validate a simple-to-use nomogram 
consisting of independent prognostic variables for the prediction of in-hospital 
mortality in patients with AHF undergoing CRRT. Methods: We collected clinical 
data for 121 patients with a diagnosis of AHF who underwent CRRT in an AHF unit 
between September 2011 and August 2020 and from 105 patients in the medical 
information mart for intensive care III (MIMIC-III) database. The nomogram model 
was created using a visual processing logistic regression model and verified 
using the standard method. Results: Patient age, days after admission, lactic 
acid level, blood glucose concentration, and diastolic blood pressure were the 
significant prognostic factors in the logistic regression analyses and were 
included in our model (named D-GLAD) as predictors. The resulting model 
containing the above-mentioned five factors had good discrimination ability in 
both the training group (C-index, 0.829) and the validation group (C-index, 
0.740). The calibration and clinical effectiveness showed the nomogram to be 
accurate for the prediction of in-hospital mortality in both the training and 
validation cohort when compared with other models. The in-hospital mortality 
rates in the low-risk, moderate-risk, and high-risk groups were 14.46, 40.74, 
and 71.91%, respectively. Conclusion: The nomogram allowed the optimal 
prediction of in-hospital mortality in adults with AHF undergoing CRRT. Using 
this simple-to-use model, the in-hospital mortality risk can be determined for 
an individual patient and could be useful for the early identification of 
high-risk patients. An online version of the D-GLAD model can be accessed at

BACKGROUND: Diastolic heart failure (DHF) and type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) 
often coexist, causing increased mortality rates. Glycaemic variability (GV) 
exacerbates cardiovascular complications, but its impact on outcomes in patients 
with DHF and T2DM remains unclear. This study examined the relationships between 
GV with mortality outcomes, and developed a machine learning (ML) model for 
long-term mortality in these patients.
METHODS: Patients with DHF and T2DM were included from the Medical Information 
Mart for Intensive Care IV, with admissions (2008-2019) as primary analysis 
cohort and admissions (2020-2022) as external validation cohort. Multivariate 
Cox proportional hazards models and restricted cubic spline analyses were used 
to evaluate the associations of GV with 90-day, 1-year, and 3-year all-cause 
mortality. The primary analysis cohort was split into training and internal 
validation cohorts, then developing ML models for predicting 1-year all-cause 
mortality in training cohort, which were validated using the internal and 
external validation cohorts.
RESULTS: 2,128 patients with DHF and T2DM were included in primary analysis 
cohort (meidian age 71.0years [IQR: 62.0-79.0]; 46.9% male), 498 patients with 
DHF and T2DM were included in the external validation cohort (meidian age 
75.0years [IQR: 67.0-81.0]; 54.0% male). Multivariate Cox proportional hazards 
models showed that high GV tertiles were associated with higher risk of 90-day 
(T2: HR 1.45, 95%CI 1.09-1.93; T3: HR 1.96, 95%CI 1.48-2.60), 1-year (T2: HR 
1.25, 95%CI 1.02-1.53; T3: HR 1.54, 95%CI 1.26-1.89), and 3-year (T2: HR 1.31, 
95%CI: 1.10-1.56; T3: HR 1.48, 95%CI 1.23-1.77) all-cause mortality, compared 
with lowest GV tertile. Chronic kidney disease, creatinine, potassium, 
haemoglobin, and white blood cell were identified as mediators of GV and 1-year 
all-cause mortality. Additionally, GV and other clinical features were 
pre-selected to construct ML models. The random forest model performed best, 
with AUC (0.770) and G-mean (0.591) in internal validation, with AUC (0.753) and 
G-mean (0.599) in external validation.
CONCLUSION: GV was determined as an independent risk factor for short-term and 
long-term all-cause mortality in patients with DHF and T2DM, with a potential 
intervention threshold around 25.0%. The ML model incorporating GV demonstrated 
strong predictive performance for 1-year all-cause mortality, highlighting its 
importance in early risk stratification management of these patients.

PURPOSE: Hemoglobin (Hb) levels and red cell distribution width (RDW) are 
standard and widely used parameters that predict clinical outcomes in patients 
with chronic heart failure (CHF). The Hb to RDW ratio (HRR) provides an 
incremental clinical prediction, as it reflects the various clinical 
characteristics of patients. No published data exists in the Medical Information 
Mart for Intensive Care (MIMIC-IV) and eICU Collaborative Research Database 
(eICU-CRD) databases on HRR and its association with in-hospital mortality among 
patients with CHF. The aim of this study was to evaluate the relationship 
between the HRR and in-hospital mortality in two large real-world cohorts of 
patients with chronic CHF.
PATIENTS AND METHODS: Data from the MIMIC-IV and eICU-CRD databases were used to 
explore the association between HRR and in-hospital mortality. 
Multivariate logistic regression, stratified analysis with interaction, and 
restricted cubic splines were used to investigate the association between 
HRR and in-hospital mortality.
RESULTS:  A total of 30,411 patients with CHF were enrolled based on the 
MIMIC-IV and multicenter eICU-CRD databases (15,983 and 14,428, respectively), 
including 16,295 men and 14,116 women with a median age of 73 years. The mean 
HRR was 0.69 ± 0.20. The overall in-hospital mortality rate was 12.63%. 
Increasing quantiles of HRR were associated with reduced in-hospital mortality 
rates. After adjusting for significant predictors, multivariate logistic 
regression analysis demonstrated that a low HRR was a significant predictor of 
in-hospital mortality, with a graded reduction in risk as HRR increased. 
Sensitivity analysis using restricted cubic splines demonstrated a continuous 
increase in in-hospital mortality risk with decreasing HRR (P = 0.262 for the 
non-linear model).
CONCLUSION: A linear relationship was observed between baseline HRR levels and 
in-hospital mortality. Lower HRR levels were associated with higher in-hospital 
mortality in patients with CHF. HRR could be a reliable clinical metric for 
assessing in-hospital mortality risk.

OBJECTIVE: To assess the impact of intra-aortic balloon pumps (IABP) on patients 
with cardiogenic shock in an intensive care unit setting.
BACKGROUND: IABP counterpulsation is a widely used mechanical circulatory 
support device, but its performance has been questioned. However, current 
evidence of IABP use in cardiogenic shock is very limited (mainly from the 
IABP-SHOCK II trial), which was restricted to cardiogenic shock complicating 
acute myocardial infarction.
METHODS: This was a retrospective, real-world, cohort study based on the Medical 
Information Mart for Intensive Care III database. Adult patients with a 
diagnosis of cardiogenic shock were eligible.
RESULTS: A total of 1028 patients with cardiogenic shock were assessed, 
including 384 patients who received IABP and 644 patients who did not. The 
in-hospital mortality was significantly lower in patients who received IABP 
(adjusted odds ratio: 0.75, 95% confidence interval: 0.62-0.91, p = 0.009). 
Analysis of secondary endpoints found that the use of IABP was associated with a 
significantly lower risk of 1-year mortality. After propensity score matching, 
the in-hospital mortality remained significantly lower in the IABP group (28.10% 
vs. 37.59%, p = 0.018).
CONCLUSIONS: In the current cohort, IABP treatment was associated with a lower 
risk of in-hospital mortality in patients with cardiogenic shock. Due to the 
complexity of pathophysiology in cardiogenic shock and the discrepancies in 
current evidence, our results should be validated through further studies in the 
future.

BACKGROUND: This study sought to develop and validate a dynamic nomogram chart 
to assess the risk of acute kidney injury (AKI) in patients with acute ischemic 
stroke (AIS).
METHODS: These data were drawn from the Medical Information Mart for Intensive 
Care III (MIMIC-III) database, which collects 47 clinical indicators of patients 
after admission to the hospital. The primary outcome indicator was the 
occurrence of AKI within 48 h of intensive care unit (ICU) admission. 
Independent risk factors for AKI were screened from the training set using 
univariate and multifactorial logistic regression analyses. Multiple logistic 
regression models were developed, and nomograms were plotted and validated in an 
internal validation set. Based on the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) 
curve, calibration curve, and decision curve analysis (DCA) to estimate the 
performance of this nomogram.
RESULTS: Nomogram indicators include blood urea nitrogen (BUN), creatinine, red 
blood cell distribution width (RDW), heart rate (HR), Oxford Acute Severity of 
Illness Score (OASIS), the history of congestive heart failure (CHF), the use of 
vancomycin, contrast agent, and mannitol. The predictive model displayed well 
discrimination with the area under the ROC curve values of 0.8529 and 0.8598 for 
the training set and the validator, respectively. Calibration curves revealed 
favorable concordance between the actual and predicted incidence of AKI (p > 
0.05). DCA indicates the excellent net clinical benefit of nomogram in 
predicting AKI.
CONCLUSION: In summary, we explored the incidence of AKI in patients with AIS 
during ICU stay and developed a predictive model to help clinical 
decision-making.

BACKGROUND: Pulmonary embolism (PE) patients combined with heart failure (HF) 
have been reported to have a high short-term mortality. However, few studies 
have developed predictive tools of 30-day mortality for these patients in 
intensive care unit (ICU). This study aimed to construct and validate a machine 
learning (ML) model to predict 30-day mortality for PE patients combined with HF 
in ICU.
METHODS: We enrolled patients with PE combined with HF in the Medical 
Information Mart for Intensive Care Database (MIMIC) and developed six ML models 
after feature selection. Further, eICU Collaborative Research Database 
(eICU-CRD) was utilized for external vali- dation. The area under curves (AUC), 
calibration curves, decision curve analysis (DCA), net reclassification 
improvement (NRI), and integrated discrimination improvement (IDI) were 
performed to evaluate the prediction performance. Shapley additive explanation 
(SHAP) was performed to enhance the interpretability of our models.
RESULTS: A total of 472 PE patients combined with HF were included. We developed 
six ML models by the 13 selected features. After internal validation, the 
Support Vector Ma- chine (SVM) model performed best with an AUC of 0.835, a 
superior calibration degree, and a wider risk threshold (from 0% to 90%) for 
obtaining clinical benefit, which also outperformed traditional mortality risk 
evaluation systems,as evaluated by NRI and IDI. The SVM model was still reliable 
after external validation. SHAP was performed to explain the model. Moreover, an 
online application was developed for further clinical use.
CONCLUSION: This study developed a potential tool for identify short-term 
mortality risk to guide clinical decision making for PE patients combined with 
HF in the ICU. The SHAP method also helped clinicians to better understand the 
model.

OBJECTIVES: Given the high incidence and mortality rate of sepsis, early 
identification of high-risk patients and timely intervention are crucial. 
However, existing mortality risk prediction models still have shortcomings in 
terms of operation, applicability, and evaluation on long-term prognosis. This 
study aims to investigate the risk factors for death in patients with sepsis, 
and to construct the prediction model of short-term and long-term mortality 
risk.
METHODS: Patients meeting sepsis 3.0 diagnostic criteria were selected from the 
Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care-IV (MIMIC-IV) database and randomly 
divided into a modeling group and a validation group at a ratio of 7꞉3. Baseline 
data of patients were analyzed. Univariate Cox regression analysis and full 
subset regression were used to determine the risk factors of death in patients 
with sepsis and to screen out the variables to construct the prediction model. 
The time-dependent area under the curve (AUC), calibration curve, and decision 
curve were used to evaluate the differentiation, calibration, and clinical 
practicability of the model.
RESULTS: A total of 14 240 patients with sepsis were included in our study. The 
28-day and 1-year mortality were 21.45% (3 054 cases) and 36.50% (5 198 cases), 
respectively. Advanced age, female, high sepsis-related organ failure assessment 
(SOFA) score, high simplified acute physiology score II (SAPS II), rapid heart 
rate, rapid respiratory rate, septic shock, congestive heart failure, chronic 
obstructive pulmonary disease, liver disease, kidney disease, diabetes, 
malignant tumor, high white blood cell count (WBC), long prothrombin time (PT), 
and high serum creatinine (SCr) levels were all risk factors for sepsis death 
(all P<0.05). Eight variables, including PT, respiratory rate, body temperature, 
malignant tumor, liver disease, septic shock, SAPS II, and age were used to 
construct the model. The AUCs for 28-day and 1-year survival were 0.717 (95% CI 
0.710 to 0.724) and 0.716 (95% CI 0.707 to 0.725), respectively. The calibration 
curve and decision curve showed that the model had good calibration degree and 
clinical application value.
CONCLUSIONS: The short-term and long-term mortality risk prediction models of 
patients with sepsis based on the MIMIC-IV database have good recognition 
ability and certain clinical reference significance for prognostic risk 
assessment and intervention treatment of patients.

Background: Hypochloremia is an independent predictor for mortality in patients 
with coronary artery disease (CAD) but whether the same correlation exists in 
CAD patients with congestive heart failure (CHF) is unclear. Methods: This is an 
analysis of data stored in the databases of the CIN-I [a registry of Cardiorenal 
Improvement (NCT04407936) in China from January 2007 to December 2018] and 
Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care (MIMIC)-III. CAD patients with CHF 
were included. The outcome measures were 90-day all-cause mortality (ACM) and 
long-term ACM. Results: Data from 8,243 CAD patients with CHF were analyzed. We 
found that 10.2% of the study population had hypochloremia (Cl- <98 mmol/L) in 
CIN-I (n = 4,762) and 20.1% had hypochloremia in MIMIC-III (n = 3,481). Patients 
suffering from hypochloremia were, in general, older and had a higher prevalence 
of comorbidities. After adjustment for confounders, hypochloremia remained a 
significant predictor of short-term mortality risk [90-day ACM: adjusted hazard 
ratio (aHR), 1.69; 95% CI, 1.27-2.25; P < 0.001 in CIN-I, and 1.36 (1.17-1.59); 
P < 0.001 in MIMIC-III]. Hypochloremia was also associated with long-term 
mortality [aHR, 1.26; 95% CI, 1.06-1.50; P = 0.009 in CIN-I, and 1.48 
(1.32-1.66); P < 0.001 in MIMIC-III]. Prespecified subgroup analyses revealed an 
association of hypochloremia with long-term ACM to be attenuated slightly in the 
women of the two databases (P interaction < 0.05). Conclusions: Hypochloremia is 
independently associated with higher short-term and long-term ACM. Further 
studies are needed to determine if early preventive measurements and active 
intervention of hypochloremia can reduce the mortality risk of CAD patients with 
CHF.

BACKGROUND: Mechanical ventilation (MV) is often applied in critically ill 
patients in intensive care unit (ICU) to protect the airway from aspiration, and 
supplement more oxygen. MV may result in ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) 
in ICU patients. This study was to estimate the 90-day and 180-day mortalities 
of ICU patients with VAP, and to explore the influence of VAP on the outcomes of 
ICU patients.
METHODS: Totally, 8182 patients who aged ≥18 years and received mechanical 
ventilation (MV) in ICU from Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care III 
(MIMIC III) database were involved in this study. All subjects were divided into 
the VAP group (n = 537) and the non-VAP group (n = 7626) based on the occurrence 
of VAP. Clinical data of all participants were collected. The effect of VAP on 
the prognosis of ICU patients was explored by binary logistic regression 
analysis.
RESULTS: The results delineated that the 90-day mortality of VAP patients in ICU 
was 33.33% and 180-day mortality was 37.62%. The 90-day and 180-day mortality 
rates were higher in the VAP group than in the non-VAP group. After adjusting 
the confounders including age, ethnicity, heart failure, septicemia, simplified 
acute physiology score II (SAPSII) score, sequential organ failure assessment 
(SOFA) score, serum lactate, white blood cell (WBC), length of ICU stay, length 
of hospital stay, length of ventilation, antibiotic treatment, Pseudomonas 
aeruginosa (P.aeruginosa), methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), 
other pathogens, the risk of 90-day and 180-day mortalities in VAP patients were 
1.465 times (OR = 1.465, 95%CI: 1.188-1.807, P < 0.001) and 1.635 times 
(OR = 1.635, 95%CI: 1.333-2.005, P < 0.001) higher than those in non-VAP 
patients, respectively.
CONCLUSIONS: Our study revealed that ICU patients with VAP had poorer prognosis 
than those without VAP. The results of this study might offer a deeper insight 
into preventing the occurrence of VAP.

OBJECTIVE: There was a lack of studies on the relationship between the presence 
or absence of echocardiography and the prognosis of type 2 diabetes mellitus 
(DM) patients. Therefore, we used the Medical Information Mart for Intensive 
Care (MIMIC)-IV database to explore the relationship between them.
METHOD: The patient information was obtained from the MIMIC-IV database. Taking 
age, BMI, sex, race, and marital status as scoring items, Propensity Score 
Matching was carried out according to the ratio of 1: 1. Generalized linear 
regression, multivariate logistic regression and hierarchical analysis were used 
to analyze the correlation between echocardiography and prognosis in type 2 DM 
patients.
RESULTS: A total of 9140 patients were enrolled in this study. There were 
differences in body mass index, days of type 2 DM, estimation of glomerular 
filtration rate, length of stay, survival time, readmission, marital status, 
family history of type 2 DM, drinking, smoking, metformin, coronary heart 
disease, heart failure, arrhythmia, hypertension, hyperlipidemia, 
cardiomyopathy, myocardial infarction, atherosclerosis, epilepsy, and thyroid 
diseases between patients with echocardiography and those without 
echocardiography. Echocardiography was independently related to survival time 
and readmission in type 2 DM patients. Besides, echocardiography was related to 
the survival time of patients with type 2 DM without complications.
CONCLUSIONS: We found for the first time that echocardiography was independently 
associated with the survival time of type 2 DM patients without complications.

OBJECTIVE: Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is a leading cause of 
global morbidity and death. The blood urea nitrogen-to-creatinine ratio (BCR) is 
recognized as a crucial marker to assess renal function and cardiovascular risk. 
Nevertheless, the effects of BCR on COPD patients suffering comorbid congestive 
heart failure (CHF) is not clarified. This study aims to elucidate the 
association between BCR and CHF risk in the COPD population.
METHODS: Data from COPD patients meeting the eligibility criteria were from the 
Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care IV (MIMIC-IV) database. The 
cumulative incidence curve was utilized for examining the link of BCR to CHF. 
Kaplan-Meier (KM) analysis was carried out for evaluating the relation of BCR to 
in-hospital mortality(IHM). Multivariable Cox regression assisted in assessing 
the correlation of BCR with CHF risk. Restricted cubic splines (RCS) were 
leveraged for unraveling the association of BCR (as a continuous variable) with 
CHF.
RESULTS: Our study included 2,840 COPD patients in the intensive care unit for 
the first time, with hospital stays exceeding 24 h. The incidence of CHF was 
57.18% among these patients. Cumulative incidence curve analysis demonstrated a 
notably increased CHF incidence in patients having higher BCR 
(18.889 < BCR ≤ 92.5) in contrast to those with lower BCR (2.877 ≤ BCR ≤ 18.889) 
(p < 0.0001). KM survival analysis indicated a markedly elevated IHM risk in 
patients with higher BCR in comparison to those with lower BCR (p < 0.0001). 
Multivariable Cox regression and RCS analysis further confirmed that higher BCR 
was linked to a risen likelihood of CHF [hazard ratio (HR) = 1.28, 95% 
confidence interval (CI, 1.15-1.44), p < 0.001]. Subgroup analysis revealed a 
higher risk of CHF [HR = 1.41, 95% CI (1.13-1.76), p = 0.002] in patients with 
diabetes than those without [HR = 1.24, 95% CI (1.08-1.41), p = 0.002].
CONCLUSION: Elevated BCR is an independent risk factor for CHF in critically ill 
COPD individuals and strongly related to a risen risk of CHF. The findings prove 
BCR as a reliable clinical predictor, facilitating risk stratification and 
personalized treatment for COPD patients with comorbid CHF.

BACKGROUND: Heart failure (HF) and atrial fibrillation (AF) usually coexist and 
are associated with a poorer prognosis. This study aimed to develop a model to 
predict in-hospital mortality in patients with HF combined with AF.
METHODS: Patients with HF and AF were obtained from the Medical Information Mart 
for Intensive Care IV (MIMIC-IV) database from 2008 to 2019. Feature selection 
was based on the Mann-Whitney U test and the least absolute shrinkage and 
selection operator (LASSO) regression model. Random Forest, eXtreme Gradient 
Boosting (XGBoost), Light Gradient Boosting Machine (LGBM), K-Nearest Neighbor 
(KNN) models, and their stacked model (the stacking ensemble model) were 
established. The area under of the curve (AUC) with 95% confidence interval 
(CI), sensitivity, specificity, as well as accuracy were applied to assess the 
performance of the predictive models.
RESULTS: A total of 5,998 patients with HF combined with AF were included, of 
which 4,198 patients were assigned to the training set and 1,800 to the testing 
set (7:3). Among these 4,198 patients, 624 (14.86%) died in-hospital and 3,574 
(85.14%) survived. Twenty-two features were used to construct the predictive 
model. Among these four single models, the AUC was 0.747 (95%CI: 0.717-0.777) 
for the Random Forest model, 0.755 (95%CI: 0.725-0.785) for the XGBoost model, 
0.754 (95%CI: 0.724-0.784) for the LGBM model, and 0.746 (95%CI: 0.716-0.776) 
for the KNN model in the testing set. The stacking ensemble model had the 
highest AUC compared to the four single models, with AUCs of 0.837 (95%CI: 
0.821-0.852) and 0.768 (95%CI: 0.740-0.796) for the training set and testing 
set, respectively.
CONCLUSION: The stacking ensemble model showed a good predictive effect in 
predicting in-hospital mortality in patients with HF combined with AF and may 
provide clinicians with a reference tool for early identification of mortality 
risk.

BACKGROUND: Currently, the clinical evidence regarding the prognostic 
significance of the TyG index in acute myocardial infarction (AMI) patients 
remains unclear. Our research analyzed the correlation between the TyG index and 
the risk of mortality in patients with AMI, in order to evaluate the influence 
of the TyG index on the prognosis of this population.
METHODS: 1205 ICU patients with AMI were analyzed in this retrospective cohort 
analysis, and the necessary data were obtained from the Medical Information Mart 
for Intensive Care IV (MIMIC-IV) database. The study conducted Kaplan-Meier 
analysis to compare all-cause mortality rates across four groups of patients. 
The study included logistic regression and Cox regression analysis to examine 
the correlation among the TyG index and the risk of in-hospital, 28-day, and 
90-day mortality.
RESULTS: In our study, 176 (14.61%) patients experienced in-hospital deaths, 198 
(16.43%) patients died within 28 days of follow-up, and 189 (23.98%) patients 
died within 90 days of follow-up. Logistic regression and Cox proportional 
hazard analyses revealed that the TyG index was an independent predictor of 
in-hospital, 28-day, and 90-day mortality (OR: 1.406, 95% CI 1.141-1.731, p = 
0.001; HR: 1.364, 95% CI 1.118-1.665, p = 0.002; HR: 1.221, 95% CI 1.024-1.445, 
p = 0.026, respectively). The restricted cubic spline regression model showed 
that the risk of in-hospital, 28-day, and 90-day mortality increased linearly 
with increasing TyG index.
CONCLUSIONS: The TyG index was significantly associated with an increased risk 
of mortality in AMI patients. Our findings suggested that the TyG index may be 
instrumental in identifying patients at high risk for adverse outcomes following 
AMI.

BACKGROUND: Inflammation plays a critical role in acute myocardial infarction 
(AMI). Recent studies have shown the value of hematologic indicators in MI risk 
stratification and prognostic assessment. However, the association between 
lymphocyte-to-monocyte ratio (LMR) and the long-term mortality of critically ill 
MI patients remains unclear.
METHODS: Clinical data were extracted from the Medical Information Mart for 
Intensive Care III database. Patients diagnosed with AMI on admission in the 
intensive care units were include. The optimal cutoff value of LMR was 
determined by X-tile software. The Cox proportional hazard model was applied for 
the identification of independent prognostic factors of 1-year mortality and 
survival curves were estimated using the Kaplan-Meier method. In order to reduce 
selection bias, a 1:1 propensity score matching (PSM) method was performed.
RESULTS: A total of 1517 AMI patients were included in this study. The cutoff 
value for 1-year mortality of LMR determined by X-Tile software was 3.00. A 
total of 534 pairs of patients were matched after PSM. Multivariate analysis 
(HR = 1.369, 95%CI 1.110-1.687, P = 0.003) and PSM subgroups (HR = 1.299, 95%CI 
1.032-1.634, P = 0.026) showed that 1-year mortality was significantly higher in 
patients with LMR < 3.00 than patients with LMR ≥ 3.00 in Cox proportional 
hazard models. The survival curves showed that patients with LMR < 3.00 had a 
significantly lower 1-year survival rate before (63.83 vs. 81.03%, Log rank 
P < 0.001) and after PSM (68.13 vs. 74.22%, Log rank P = 0.041).
CONCLUSION: In this retrospective cohort analysis, we demonstrated that a low 
admission LMR (< 3.00) was associated with a higher risk of 1-year mortality in 
critically ill patients with AMI.

To investigate the association between blood pressure variability (BPV) and 
mortality (in-hospital and 30-day) among heart failure (HF) patients, and to 
examine these associations across patient subgroups. This multicenter 
retrospective cohort study analyzed 25,591 heart failure patients from two 
intensive care databases (eICU Collaborative Research Database [eICU-CRD] and 
the Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care IV [MIMIC-IV]). BPV was assessed 
using coefficient of variation of systolic (SBPV), diastolic (DBPV), and mean 
(MBPV) blood pressure measurements. Multivariable logistic regression and Cox 
proportional hazards models evaluated mortality associations, adjusting for 
clinical parameters. The observed mortality rates were 14.7% (in-hospital) and 
17.3% (30-day). Higher BPV demonstrated significant associations with increased 
mortality risk, with SBPV showing the strongest relationship. For in-hospital 
mortality, each standard deviation increase in SBPV, DBPV, and MBPV corresponded 
to adjusted odds ratios of 1.56 (95% CI 1.51-1.62), 1.21 (95% CI 1.16-1.25), and 
1.42 (95% CI 1.37-1.48), respectively. For 30-day mortality, adjusted hazard 
ratios were 1.37 (95% CI 1.33-1.41) for SBPV, 1.15 (95% CI 1.12-1.19) for DBPV, 
and 1.30 (95% CI 1.27-1.34) for MBPV. These associations remained robust across 
all patient subgroups. Increased blood pressure variability during 
hospitalization independently predicts higher in-hospital (14.7%) and 30-day 
mortality (17.3%) in HF patients, with SBPV showing the strongest association 
(OR: 1.56, 95% CI 1.51-1.62). BPV may serve as a valuable prognostic marker for 
risk stratification in hospitalized heart failure patients.

BACKGROUND: Cardiac arrest (CA) can activate the coagulation system. Some 
coagulation-related indicators are associated with clinical outcomes. Early 
evaluation of patients with cardiac arrest-associated coagulopathy (CAAC) not 
only predicts clinical outcomes, but also allows for timely clinical 
intervention to prevent disseminated intravascular coagulation.
OBJECTIVE: To assess whether CAAC predicts 30-day cumulative mortality.
METHODS: From the Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care IV (MIMIC-IV) 
database, we conducted a retrospective cohort study from 2008 to 2019. Based on 
international normalized ratio (INR) value and platelet count, we diagnosed CAAC 
cases and made the following stratification of severity: mild CAAC was defined 
as 1.4 > INR≧1.2 and 100,000/µL < platelet count≦150,000/µL; moderate CAAC was 
defined with either 1.6 > INR≧1.4 or 80,000/µL < platelet count≦100,000/µL; 
severe CAAC was defined as an INR≧1.6 and platelet count≦80,000/µL.
RESULTS: A total of 1485 patients were included. Crude survival analysis showed 
that patients with CAAC had higher mortality risk than those without CAAC (33.0% 
vs 52.0%, P < 0.001). Unadjusted survival analysis showed an incremental 
increase in the risk of mortality as the severity of CAAC increased. After 
adjusting confounders (prehospital characteristics and hospitalization 
characteristics), CAAC was independently associated with 30-day mortality 
(hazard rate [HR] 1.77, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.41-2.25; P < 0.001); 
moderate CAAC (HR 1.48, 95% CI 1.09-2.10; P = 0.027) and severe CAAC (HR 2.22, 
95% CI 1.64-2.97; P < 0.001) were independently associated with 30-day 
mortality.
CONCLUSION: The presence of CAAC identifies a group of CA at higher risk for 
mortality, and there is an incremental increase in risk of mortality as the 
severity of CAAC increases. However, the results of this study should be further 
verified by multicenter study.

BACKGROUND: It remains poorly understood whether early use of beta-blockers 
could provide a survival advantage in patients with critical heart failure (HF) 
.
METHODS: This retrospective study was conducted using the American Medical 
Information Mart for Intensive Care (MIMIC)-IV database. Study participants were 
critical HF patients who were divided into two groups: within 24-hour use of 
beta-blockers group and no use of beta-blockers group. The primary study 
endpoints were 7-day, 30-day, and 360-day all-cause mortality.
RESULTS: Out of the 10,184 patients diagnosed with critical HF, after propensity 
score match (PSM), 7352 patients were recruited and were divided into within 
24-h use of beta-blockers group (n = 3676) and no beta blockers group (n = 
3676). The 7-day, 30-day, and 360-day all-cause mortality were significantly 
higher in the no beta blockers group (7-day: 10.3% vs 5.5%; 30-day: 21.4% vs 
15.7%; 360-day: 40.0% vs 35.3%; all p < 0.001). Kaplan-Meier analyses showed 
that the cumulative incidence of 7-day, 30-day, and 360-day all-cause mortality 
were significantly higher in the no beta blockers group (all log-rank p < 
0.001). After PSM, Cox proportional hazards analyses revealed that beta blockers 
administration within 24 h of admission to intensive care unit (ICU) was 
independently associated with decreased 7-day (HR = 0.52 95%CI: 0.44, 0.62, p < 
0.001), 30-day (HR = 0.70 95%CI: 0.63, 0.78, p < 0.001), and 360-day (HR = 0.83 
95%CI: 0.77, 0.89, p < 0.001) all-cause mortality.
CONCLUSION: Administration of beta blockers within 24 h after admission to ICU 
was associated with reduced risk of mortality in critical HF patients. However, 
prospective randomized controlled trials are needed to confirm our findings due 
to the retrospective nature of the present study and the limitations of the 
MIMIC-IV database itself.

BACKGROUND: The prognostic value of in-hospital hemoglobin drop in non-overt 
bleeding patients with acute myocardial infarction (AMI) admitted to the 
intensive care unit (ICU) remains insufficiently investigated.
METHODS: A retrospective analysis was performed based on the Medical Information 
Mart for Intensive Care (MIMIC)-IV database. 2,334 ICU-admitted non-overt 
bleeders diagnosed with AMI were included. In-hospital hemoglobin values 
(baseline value on admission and nadir value during hospitalization) were 
available. Hemoglobin drop was defined as a positive difference between 
admission and in-hospital nadir hemoglobin. The primary endpoint was 180-day 
all-cause mortality. The time-dependent Cox proportional hazard models were 
structured to analyze the connection between hemoglobin drop and mortality.
RESULTS: 2,063 patients (88.39%) experienced hemoglobin drop during 
hospitalization. We categorized patients based on the degree of hemoglobin drop: 
no hemoglobin drop (n = 271), minimal hemoglobin drop (< 3 g/dl; n = 1661), 
minor hemoglobin drop (≥ 3 g/dl & < 5 g/dl, n = 284) and major hemoglobin drop 
(≥ 5 g/dl; n = 118). Minor (adjusted hazard ratio [HR] = 12.68; 95% confidence 
interval [CI]: 5.13-31.33; P < 0.001) and major (adjusted HR = 13.87; 95% CI: 
4.50-42.76; P < 0.001) hemoglobin drops were independently associated with 
increased 180-day mortality. After adjusting the baseline hemoglobin level, a 
robust nonlinear relationship was observed in the association between hemoglobin 
drop and 180-day mortality, with 1.34 g/dl as the lowest value (HR = 1.04; 95% 
CI: 1.00-1.08).
CONCLUSION: In non-overt bleeding ICU-admitted patients with AMI, in-hospital 
hemoglobin drop is independently associated with higher 180-day all-cause 
mortality.

BACKGROUND: Heart rate (HR) was one of the risk factors for cardiovascular 
disease, but there was insufficient evidence to demonstrate a relationship 
between heart rate fluctuations and the prognosis of patients with acute 
myocardial infarction (AMI). The objective of this study is to investigate the 
relationship between 24-h heart rate fluctuations after admission to the 
Intensive Care Unit (ICU) and 30-day, 1-year, and 3-year mortality rates in 
patients with AMI in order to examine its implications for prognosis in AMI 
patients.
METHODS: All data were obtained from the Medical Information Mart for Intensive 
Care III Database (MIMIC III). We calculated heart rate fluctuations using the 
maximum and minimum values of the patient's heart rate during the first 24 h 
after ICU admission and divided them into three groups (< 23beats/min, 
23-33beats/min, > 33beats/min) according to tertiles. The COX risk regression 
model was applied to the analysis, and subgroup analyses were performed for use 
in testing the robustness of the results. Curve fitting was performed to explore 
whether there was a nonlinear relationship between heart rate fluctuations and 
mortality. Outcome measures were 30-day, 1-year, and 3-year mortality in 
patients with AMI.
RESULTS: After strict confounding adjustment, COX multifactorial analysis showed 
that patients' heart rate fluctuations were positively associated with 30-day, 
1-year, and 3-year mortality rates (HR = 1.17, 95%CI: 1.11 ~ 1.23; HR = 1.17, 
95%CI: 1.12 ~ 1.22; HR = 1.17, 95%CI: 1.12 ~ 1.21). In addition, the high heart 
rate fluctuation group (> 33 beats/min) had a significantly increased risk of 
death (HR = 1.76, 95%CI: 1.28 ~ 2.42; HR = 1.59, 95%CI: 1.25 ~ 2.03; HR = 1.43, 
95%CI: 1.15 ~ 1.77). In the curve-fitting analysis, a J-shaped curve 
relationship among heart rate fluctuations and 1- and 3-year mortality was found 
(p for non-linearity = 0.049; p for non-linearity = 0.004), with an inflection 
point of 28 beats/min. In subgroup analyses, there was an interaction between 
heart rate fluctuations and age (P for interaction = 0.041).
CONCLUSIONS: Heart rate fluctuations within 24 h after ICU admission of AMI 
patients were associated with 30-day, 1-year, and 3-year mortality, which is a 
simple and stable predictor of patients' short- and long-term prognosis. 
Furthermore, 24-h heart rate fluctuations showed a "J" curve relationship with 
1- and 3-year mortality, with fluctuations of 28 beats/min predicting the best 
prognosis.

BACKGROUND: Statins, acknowledged for their ability to reduce cardiovascular 
risk, demonstrate a variety of pleiotropic effects, including anti-inflammatory, 
antithrombotic, endothelial stabilizing activity and prevention of acute kidney 
injury (AKI) post cardiac surgery. Patients in the intensive care unit (ICU) 
face heightened risks of cardiovascular disease, infections, and thrombotic 
complications, but the effect of statin therapy on ICU mortality remains 
controversial. The Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care IV (MIMIC-IV) 
database is a publicly available intensive care medicine information database 
that includes data on critically ill patients admitted to the ICU at Beth Israel 
Deaconess Medical Center from 2008 to 2019, with a large sample size. In this 
retrospective cohort study, the MIMIC-IV database was used to clarify the 
association between statin therapy and all-cause mortality in critically ill 
patients. An additional aim was to compare the effect of different statin types 
on mortality.
METHODS: Patients aged 18 years or older, with first-time admissions and 
complete data, were categorized based on their use of statins during their ICU 
stay. The primary outcome was 28-day mortality, analyzed through multivariable 
Cox regression and expressed as adjusted hazard ratios (HRs) with 95% confidence 
intervals (CIs). The relationship between statin therapy and 28-day mortality in 
ICU patients was estimated using propensity score matching (PSM) and 
multivariable analysis to adjust for covariates.
RESULTS: Among the 50,624 enrolled patients, 30.9% were treated with statins. 
Compared to patients not receiving statin therapy, those on statins were older, 
had a higher proportion of males (62.0% vs. 53.1%), a greater percentage with 
health insurance (50.2% vs. 39.5%), and a higher rate of concurrent aspirin use 
(70.8% vs. 18.2%). In terms of comorbidities, patients in the statin group had 
higher proportions of congestive heart failure (CHF), AKI, myocardial 
infarction, and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). Statin treatment 
in patients in the ICU was correlated with reduced 28-day all-cause mortality in 
the multivariate Cox analysis (statins: HR =0.66, 95% CI: 0.61-0.70; 
atorvastatin: HR =0.71, 95% CI: 0.66-0.78; rosuvastatin: HR =0.57, 95% CI: 
0.45-0.72; simvastatin: HR =0.54, 95% CI: 0.48-0.62; other statins: HR =0.68, 
95% CI: 0.56-0.83). PSM confirmed these findings (statins: HR =0.69, 95% CI: 
0.63-0.75).
CONCLUSIONS: Statin use may correlate with a decreased risk of 28-day mortality 
in patients in the ICU, with simvastatin showing a more pronounced effect. The 
robustness of these findings remain unaffected in the subgroup analyses, 
sensitivity analyses, and PSM, indicating potential clinical significance. The 
high mortality rate among ICU patients means that any method capable of reducing 
mortality could have significant implications for ICU treatment.

PURPOSE: The purpose of this research was to assess the relationship between red 
blood cell distribution width (RDW) and mortality in patients with 
gastrointestinal (GIB) bleeding in the intensive care unit (ICU).
METHODS: The information of the participants was obtained from the Medical 
Information Mart for Intensive Care IV database. The main outcome of this 
research was 30/90-day mortality, with ICU mortality and in-hospital mortality 
as secondary outcomes.
RESULTS: This research included 2924 patients with gastrointestinal bleeding in 
total. Patients with higher RDW had considerably higher 30/90-day and 
in-hospital mortality rates, as well as longer hospital stays and ICU stays. 
According to the Kaplan-Meier analysis, the 30/90-day mortality rate was 
remarkably higher among participants in the higher RDW group (P < 0.0001). In 
the adjusted multivariate Cox regression analysis, for 30-day mortality, the HR 
(95% CI) was 1.75 (1.37, 2.24) in comparison to Q1 in the reference group 
(P < 0.001). Analyses of 90-day mortality and in-hospital mortality both showed 
the same results. In the subgroup analysis, gender, myocardial infarction, 
chronic pulmonary disease, cerebrovascular disease and renal disease had no 
significant effect on the correlation between RDW values and mortality (all 
P > 0.05). The area under the ROC curve for RDW was 0.599 (95% CI 0.581-0.617) 
and 0.606 (95% CI 0.588-0.624) in 30/90-day ICU mortality.
CONCLUSION: The current research showed that RDW could be utilized as an 
independent indicator of short-term mortality in critically ill GIB patients at 
30 and 90 days of hospital admission.

We retrospectively analyzed data from the Medical Information Mart for Intensive 
Care-III critical care database to determine whether visually-assessed right 
ventricular (RV) dysfunction was associated with clinical outcomes in septic 
shock patients. Associations between visually-assessed RV dysfunction by 
echocardiography and in-hospital mortality, lethal arrhythmia, and hemodynamic 
indicators to determine the prognostic value of RV dysfunction in patients with 
septic shock were analyzed. Propensity score analysis showed RV dysfunction was 
associated with increased risk of in-hospital death in patients with septic 
shock (adjusted odds ratio [OR] 2.15; 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.99-2.32; 
P < 0.001). In multivariate logistic regression analysis, RV dysfunction was 
associated with in-hospital death (OR 2.19; 95% CI 1.91-2.53; P < 0.001), lethal 
arrhythmia (OR 2.19; 95% CI 1.34-3.57; P < 0.001), and tendency for increased 
blood lactate levels (OR 1.31; 95% CI 1.14-1.50; P < 0.001) independent of left 
ventricular (LV) dysfunction. RV dysfunction was associated with lower cardiac 
output, pulmonary artery pressure index, and RV stroke work index. In patients 
with septic shock, visually-assessed RV dysfunction was associated with 
in-hospital mortality, lethal arrhythmia, and circulatory insufficiency 
independent of LV dysfunction. Visual assessment of RV dysfunction using 
echocardiography might help to identify the short-term prognosis of patients 
with septic shock by reflecting hemodynamic status.

BACKGROUND: Reduced left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) initiates heart 
failure, and promptly identifying low ejection fraction is crucial for managing 
progression and averting mortality. In this study we developed an artificial 
intelligence-enabled electrocardiogram (AI-ECG) algorithm to identify patients 
with low ejection fraction and predict LVEF values.
METHODS: The electrocardiogram data were used as input, and the algorithm 
generated the probability of the patient suffering a low ejection fraction and 
estimated the LVEF value. A 5-year follow-up study on a group of individuals who 
initially had normal LVEF values was also performed. Furthermore, external 
validation of the algorithm performance was conducted using the Medical 
Information Mart for Intensive Care-IV database.
RESULTS: The algorithm's performance on the test set yielded an area under the 
curve value of 0.965 for detecting LVEF ≤ 50%. The algorithm had an accuracy of 
92.8%, sensitivity of 88.8%, and specificity of 92.9%. For LVEF regression, the 
method showed a mean absolute error of 5.28 (95% confidence interval, 5.23-5.33) 
for the testing set. Additionally, the algorithm obtained an area under the 
curve value of 0.848 and a mean absolute error value of 9.56 during external 
validation. Patients with false positive results had a significantly greater 
likelihood of developing a low ejection fraction compared with patients who 
received true negative results (26.2% vs 2.0%; P < 0.0001).
CONCLUSIONS: The AI-ECG algorithm is capable of identifying low ejection 
fraction in patients with high accuracy. The AI-ECG algorithm is an efficient, 
prompt, and cost-effective screening tool for early heart failure.

BACKGROUND: Acute myocardial infarction (AMI) is mainly caused by a mismatch of 
blood oxygen supply and demand in the myocardium. However, several studies have 
suggested that excessively high or low arterial oxygen tension could have 
deleterious effects on the prognosis of AMI patients. Therefore, the 
relationship between blood oxygenation and clinical outcomes among AMI patients 
is unclear, and could be nonlinear. In the critical care setting, blood oxygen 
level is commonly measured continuously using pulse oximetry-derived oxygen 
saturation (SpO2). The present study aimed to determine the association between 
admission SpO2 levels and all-cause in-hospital mortality, and to elucidate the 
optimal SpO2 range with real-world data.
METHODS: Patients diagnosed with AMI on admission in the Medical Information 
Mart for Intensive Care III (MIMIC-III) database were included. A generalized 
additive model (GAM) with loess smoothing functions was used to determine and 
visualize the nonlinear relationship between admission SpO2 levels within the 
first 24 hours after ICU admission and mortality. Moreover, the Cox regression 
model was constructed to confirm the association between SpO2 and mortality.
RESULTS: We included 1,846 patients who fulfilled our inclusion criteria, among 
whom 587 (31.80%) died during hospitalization. The GAM showed that the 
relationship between admission SpO2 levels and all-cause in-hospital mortality 
among AMI patients was nonlinear, as a U-shaped curve was observed. In addition, 
the lowest mortality was observed for an SpO2 range of 94-96%. Adjusted 
multivariable Cox regression analysis confirmed that the admission SpO2 level of 
94-96% was independently associated with decreased mortality compared to SpO2 
levels <94% [hazard ratio (HR) 1.352; 95% confidence interval (CI): 1.048-1.715; 
P=0.028] and >96% (HR 1.315; 95% CI: 1.018-1.658; P=0.030).
CONCLUSIONS: The relationship between admission SpO2 levels and all-cause 
in-hospital mortality followed a U-shaped curve among patients with AMI. The 
optimal oxygen saturation range was identified as an SpO2 range of 94-96%, which 
was independently associated with increased survival in a large and 
heterogeneous cohort of AMI patients.

Association between aspirin and mortality in critically ill patients with atrial 
fibrillation: a retrospective cohort study based on mimic-IV database.

BACKGROUND: Atrial fibrillation (AF) is a prevalent issue among critically ill 
patients, and the availability of effective treatment strategies for AF is 
limited.
AIM: The objective of this study was to evaluate the mortality rate associated 
with AF in critically ill patients who were either aspirin or non-aspirin users.
METHODS: This cohort study incorporated critically ill patients with AF from the 
Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care database. The study compared 
incidences of 28-day mortality, 90-day mortality, and 1-year mortality between 
patients with and without aspirin prescriptions. To assess the association 
between aspirin and the endpoints, Kaplan-Meier analysis and Cox proportional 
hazards regression analyses were conducted.
RESULTS: In this study, a total of 13,330 critically ill patients with atrial 
fibrillation (AF) were included, of which 4,421 and 8,909 patients were 
categorized as aspirin and non-aspirin users, respectively. The 28-day, 90-day, 
and 1-year mortality rates were found to be 17.5% (2,330/13,330), 23.9% 
(3,180/13,330), and 32.9% (4,379/13,330), respectively. The results of a 
fully-adjusted Cox proportional hazard model indicated that aspirin use was 
negatively associated with the risk of death after adjusting for confounding 
factors (28-day mortality, HR 0.64, 95% CI 0.55-0.74; 90-day mortality, HR 0.65, 
95% CI 0.58-0.74; 1-year mortality, HR 0.67, 95%CI 0.6∼0.74). The results of the 
subgroup analysis indicate a more robust correlation, specifically among 
patients under the age of 65 and those without a history of congestive heart 
failure or myocardial infarction.
CONCLUSIONS: The utilization of aspirin may exhibit a correlation with a 
reduction in risk-adjusted mortality from all causes in critically ill patients 
diagnosed with atrial fibrillation. However, additional randomized controlled 
trials are necessary to elucidate and confirm this potential association.

The purpose of this project was to characterize the longitudinal dynamic serum 
sodium trajectory of sepsis patients with lactic acidosis (LA) admitted to the 
intensive care unit (ICU), and to explore the association between these 
trajectories and the 30-day mortality rate of patients. Data on patients 
admitted to the ICU with a diagnosis of LA combined with sepsis from 2008-2019 
were collected from the Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care-IV 
(MIMIC-IV) database. Patients admitted to the ICU for > 24 hours and for the 
first time were sorted into 3 groups based on their serum sodium levels at 
admission. The Group-based Trajectory Modeling (GBTM) method was applied to 
analyze the trajectory changes of serum sodium in each group of patients over 72 
hours. Patients' survival differences between different trajectory groups were 
compared using Kaplan-Meier (K-M) survival curves. Subgroup analysis was carried 
out to determine the influencing factors of the relationship between dynamic 
changes in serum sodium and patient survival. This study included 514 patients 
with LA complicated by sepsis, who were clustered into three groups based on 
their admission serum sodium levels, with 378 patients in the normal blood 
sodium (135-145 mEq/L) group, 116 patients in the hyponatremia (< 135 mEq/L) 
group, and 20 patients in the hypernatremia (> 145 mEq/L) group. GBTM analysis 
generated three different serum sodium trajectories. The K-M curve results 
demonstrated that patients with relatively stable serum sodium levels within the 
normal range (Class 2) had lower 30-day mortality compared to groups with larger 
fluctuations in sodium levels (Class 1, Class 3). Subgroup analysis uncovered 
notable interactions (P < 0.05) between different trajectories of serum sodium 
and covariates such as race, marital status, Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS), 
Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (SOFA), renal replacement therapy (RRT), 
congestive heart failure, kidney disease, liver disease, and diabetes. Among 
patients with LA complicated by sepsis, those with stable and normal 
fluctuations in serum sodium levels had better 30-day survival rates. GBTM is a 
refined method to describe the evolution of serum sodium and its association 
with clinical outcomes, which may enhance the current understanding of blood 
sodium level regulation.

OBJECTIVE: This study aims to evaluate the association between the white blood 
cell-to-platelet ratio (WPR) and 28-day all-cause mortality among patients 
experiencing cardiac arrest.
METHODS: Utilizing data from 748 cardiac arrest patients in the Medical 
Information Mart for Intensive Care-IV (MIMIC-IV) 2.2 database, machine learning 
algorithms, including the Boruta feature selection method, random forest 
modeling, and SHAP value analysis, were applied to identify significant 
prognostic biomarkers. Key patient characteristics, encompassing demographic 
data, comorbidities, hematological and biochemical indices, and vital signs, 
were extracted using PostgreSQL Administration Tool (pgAdmin) software. The Cox 
proportional hazards model assessed the impact of WPR on mortality outcomes, 
while Kaplan-Meier survival curves and restricted cubic spline (RCS) analysis 
further validated the findings. Subgroup analyses stratified the prognostic 
value of WPR by demographic and clinical factors.
RESULTS: WPR demonstrated the highest prognostic significance among the 
variables studied, showing a strong association with 28-day all-cause mortality. 
In the unadjusted Model 1, hazard ratios (HRs) for WPR quartiles ranged from 
1.88 (95% CI: 1.22-2.90) in Q2 to 3.02 (95% CI: 2.04-4.47) in Q4 (Ptrend <0.05). 
Adjusted models (Models 2-4) confirmed the robustness of these associations, 
even after accounting for demographic and clinical covariates. Kaplan-Meier and 
RCS analyses revealed a significant U-shaped relationship between WPR and 
mortality risk. Subgroup analyses indicated that elevated WPR was particularly 
associated with increased mortality in males, elderly patients, married 
individuals, and those with chronic pulmonary disease.
CONCLUSION: WPR serves as an independent and reliable prognostic biomarker for 
28-day mortality in cardiac arrest patients. Its integration into clinical 
decision-making may enhance the early identification of high-risk patients and 
guide tailored therapeutic interventions.

BACKGROUND: Atrial fibrillation (AF) is the most common arrhythmia during 
critical illness, representing a sepsis-defining cardiac dysfunction associated 
with adverse outcomes. Large burdens of premature beats and noisy signal during 
sepsis may pose unique challenges to automated AF detection.
OBJECTIVE: The objective of this study is to develop and validate an automated 
algorithm to accurately identify AF within electronic health care data among 
critically ill patients with sepsis.
METHODS: This is a retrospective cohort study of patients hospitalized with 
sepsis identified from Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care (MIMIC III) 
electronic health data with linked electrocardiographic (ECG) telemetry 
waveforms. Within 3 separate cohorts of 50 patients, we iteratively developed 
and validated an automated algorithm that identifies ECG signals, removes noise, 
and identifies irregular rhythm and premature beats in order to identify AF. We 
compared the automated algorithm to current methods of AF identification in 
large databases, including ICD-9 (International Classification of Diseases, 9th 
edition) codes and hourly nurse annotation of heart rhythm. Methods of AF 
identification were tested against gold-standard manual ECG review.
RESULTS: AF detection algorithms that did not differentiate AF from premature 
atrial and ventricular beats performed modestly, with 76% (95% CI 61%-87%) 
accuracy. Performance improved (P=.02) with the addition of premature beat 
detection (validation set accuracy: 94% [95% CI 83%-99%]). Median time between 
automated and manual detection of AF onset was 30 minutes (25th-75th percentile 
0-208 minutes). The accuracy of ICD-9 codes (68%; P=.002 vs automated algorithm) 
and nurse charting (80%; P=.02 vs algorithm) was lower than that of the 
automated algorithm.
CONCLUSIONS: An automated algorithm using telemetry ECG data can feasibly and 
accurately detect AF among critically ill patients with sepsis, and represents 
an improvement in AF detection within large databases.

BACKGROUND: Studies have shown that more than half of patients with heart 
failure (HF) with acute kidney injury (AKI) have newonset AKI, and renal 
function evaluation markers such as estimated glomerular filtration rate are 
usually not repeatedly tested during the hospitalization. As an independent risk 
factor, delayed AKI recognition has been shown to be associated with the adverse 
events of patients with HF, such as chronic kidney disease and death.
OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study is to develop and assess of an unsupervised 
machine learning model that identifies patients with HF and normal renal 
function but who are susceptible to de novo AKI.
METHODS: We analyzed an electronic health record data set that included 5075 
patients admitted for HF with normal renal function, from which 2 phenogroups 
were categorized using an unsupervised machine learning algorithm called K-means 
clustering. We then determined whether the inferred phenogroup index had the 
potential to be an essential risk indicator by conducting survival analysis, AKI 
prediction, and the hazard ratio test.
RESULTS: The AKI incidence rate in the generated phenogroup 2 was significantly 
higher than that in phenogroup 1 (group 1: 106/2823, 3.75%; group 2: 259/2252, 
11.50%; P<.001). The survival rate of phenogroup 2 was consistently lower than 
that of phenogroup 1 (P<.005). According to logistic regression, the univariate 
model using the phenogroup index achieved promising performance in AKI 
prediction (sensitivity 0.710). The generated phenogroup index was also 
significant in serving as a risk indicator for AKI (hazard ratio 3.20, 95% CI 
2.55-4.01). Consistent results were yielded by applying the proposed model on an 
external validation data set extracted from Medical Information Mart for 
Intensive Care (MIMIC) III pertaining to 1006 patients with HF and normal renal 
function.
CONCLUSIONS: According to a machine learning analysis on electronic health 
record data, patients with HF who had normal renal function were clustered into 
separate phenogroups associated with different risk levels of de novo AKI. Our 
investigation suggests that using machine learning can facilitate patient 
phengrouping and stratification in clinical settings where the identification of 
high-risk patients has been challenging.

OBJECTIVE: Event capture in clinical trials is resource-intensive, and 
electronic medical records (EMRs) offer a potential solution. This study 
develops algorithms for EMR-based death and hospitalization capture and compares 
them with traditional event capture methods.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: We compared the effectiveness of EMR-based event capture 
and site-captured events adjudicated by a clinical endpoint committee in the 
multi-center INfluenza Vaccine to Effectively Stop cardio Thoracic Events and 
Decompensated heart failure (INVESTED) trial for participants from the Veterans 
Affairs healthcare system. Varying time windows around event dates were used to 
optimize events matching. The algorithms were externally validated for heart 
failure hospitalizations in the Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care 
(MIMIC)-IV database.
RESULTS: We observed 100% sensitivity for death events with a 1-day window. 
Sensitivity for cardiovascular, heart failure, pulmonary, and nonspecific 
cardiopulmonary hospitalizations using discharge diagnosis codes varied between 
75% and 95%. Including Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services data improved 
sensitivity with no meaningful decrease in specificity. The MIMIC-IV analysis 
showed 82% sensitivity and 99% specificity for heart failure hospitalizations.
DISCUSSION: EMR-based method accurately identifies all-cause mortality and 
demonstrates high accuracy for cardiopulmonary hospitalizations. This study 
underscores the importance of optimal time windows, data completeness, and 
domain variability in EMR systems.
CONCLUSION: EMR-based methods are effective strategies for capturing death and 
hospitalizations in clinical trials; however, their effectiveness may be 
influenced by the complexity of events and domain variability across different 
EMR systems. Nonetheless, EMR-based methods can serve as a valuable complement 
to traditional methods.

AIMS: Both hypercapnia and hypocapnia are common in patients with acute heart 
failure (AHF), but the association between partial pressure of arterial carbon 
dioxide (PaCO2) and AHF prognosis remains unclear. The objective of this study 
was to investigate the connection between PaCO2 within 24 h after admission to 
the intensive care unit (ICU) and mortality during hospitalization and at 1 year 
in AHF patients.
METHODS AND RESULTS: AHF patients were enrolled from the Medical Information 
Mart for Intensive Care IV database. The patients were divided into three groups 
by PaCO2 values of <35, 35-45, and >45 mmHg. The primary outcome was to 
investigate the connection between PaCO2 and in-hospital mortality and 1 year 
mortality in AHF patients. The secondary outcome was to assess the prediction 
value of PaCO2 in predicting in-hospital mortality and 1 year mortality in AHF 
patients. A total of 2374 patients were included in this study, including 457 
patients in the PaCO2 < 35 mmHg group, 1072 patients in the PaCO2 = 35-45 mmHg 
group, and 845 patients in the PaCO2 > 45 mmHg group. The in-hospital mortality 
was 19.5%, and the 1 year mortality was 23.9% in the PaCO2 < 35 mmHg group. 
Multivariate logistic regression analysis showed that the PaCO2 < 35 mmHg group 
was associated with an increased risk of in-hospital mortality [hazard ratio 
(HR) 1.398, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.039-1.882, P = 0.027] and 1 year 
mortality (HR 1.327, 95% CI 1.020-1.728, P = 0.035) than the PaCO2 = 35-45 mmHg 
group. The PaCO2 > 45 mmHg group was associated with an increased risk of 
in-hospital mortality (HR 1.387, 95% CI 1.050-1.832, P = 0.021); the 1 year 
mortality showed no significant difference (HR 1.286, 95% CI 0.995-1.662, 
P = 0.055) compared with the PaCO2 = 35-45 mmHg group. The Kaplan-Meier survival 
curves showed that the PaCO2 < 35 mmHg group had a significantly lower 1 year 
survival rate. The area under the receiver operating characteristic curve for 
predicting in-hospital mortality was 0.591 (95% CI 0.526-0.656), and the 1 year 
mortality was 0.566 (95% CI 0.505-0.627) in the PaCO2 < 35 mmHg group.
CONCLUSIONS: In AHF patients, hypocapnia within 24 h after admission to the ICU 
was associated with increased in-hospital mortality and 1 year mortality. 
However, the increase in 1 year mortality may be influenced by hospitalization 
mortality. Hypercapnia was associated with increased in-hospital mortality.

We aimed to determine prognostic indicators of PE patients with hemodynamic 
decompensation admitted to the ICU. PE patients with hemodynamic decompensation 
at ICU admission from Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care IV database 
were included. Least absolute shrinkage and selection operator with 2 specific 
lambdas were performed to reduce the dimension of variables after univariate 
analysis. Then we conducted multivariate logistic regression analysis and 2 
models were built. A total of 548 patients were included, among whom 187 died. 
Lactate, creatine-kinase MB, troponin-T were significantly higher in death 
group. Eight common factors were screened out from first model statistically 
mostly in consistent with second model: older age, decreased hemoglobin, 
elevated anion gap, elevated International Standard Ratio (INR), elevated 
respiratory rate, decreased temperature, decreased blood oxygen saturation 
(SpO2) and the onset of cardiac arrest were significantly risk factors for 
in-Hospital mortality. The nonlinear relationships between these indicators and 
mortality were showed by the restricted cubic spline and cutoff values were 
determined. Our study demonstrated that age, hemoglobin levels, anion gap 
levels, INR, respiratory rate, temperature, SpO2 levels, the onset of cardiac 
arrest could be applied to predict mortality of PE patients with hemodynamic 
decompensation at ICU admission.

This study compared survival outcomes between intensive care unit (ICU) patients 
receiving enteral nutrition (EN) and parenteral nutrition (PN) with vasopressor 
support, explored risk factors affecting clinical outcomes and established an 
evaluation model. Data from 1046 ICU patients receiving vasopressor therapy 
within 24 h from 2008 to 2019 were collected. Patients receiving nutritional 
therapy within 3 d of ICU admission were divided into EN or PN (including PN+EN) 
groups. Cox analysis and regression were used to determine relevant factors and 
establish a nomogram for predicting survival. The 28-d survival rate was 
significantly better in the EN group compared with the PN/PN+EN group. Risk 
factors included age, peripheral capillary oxygen saturation, red cell 
distribution width, international normalised ratio, potassium level, mean 
corpuscular Hg, myocardial infarction, liver disease, cancer status and 
nutritional status. The nomogram showed good predictive performance. In ICU 
patients receiving vasopressor drugs, patients receiving EN had a better 
survival rate than PN. Our nomogram had favourable predictive value for 28-d 
survival in patients. However, it needs further validation in prospective 
trials.

Acute myocardial infarction (AMI) is a leading cause of death and not a few of 
these patients are combined with acidemia. This study aimed to detect the 
association of acidemia with short-term mortality of AMI patients. A total of 
972 AMI patients were selected from the Medical Information Mart for Intensive 
Care (MIMIC) III database for analysis. Propensity-score matching (PSM) was used 
to reduce the imbalance. Kaplan-Meier survival analysis was used to compare the 
mortality, and Cox-proportional hazards model was used to detect related factors 
associated with mortality. After PSM, a total of 345 non-acidemia patients and 
345 matched acidemia patients were included. The non-acidemia patients had a 
significantly lower 30-day mortality (20.0% vs. 28.7%) and lower 90-day 
mortality (24.9% vs. 31.9%) than the acidemia patients (P < 0.001 for all). The 
severe-acidemia patients (PH < 7.25) had the highest 30-day mortality (52.6%) 
and 90-day mortality (53.9%) than non-acidemia patients and mild-acidemia (7.25 
≤ PH < 7.35) patients (P < 0.001). In Cox-proportional hazards model, acidemia 
was associated with improved 30-day mortality (HR = 1.518; 95%CI = 1.110-2.076, 
P = 0.009) and 90-day mortality (HR = 1.378; 95%CI = 1.034 -1.837, P = 0.029). 
These results suggest that severe acidemia is associated with improved 30-day 
mortality and 90-day mortality of AMI patients.

INTRODUCTION: Heart failure (HF) may induce bowel hypoperfusion, leading to 
hypoxia of the villa of the bowel wall and the occurrence of Clostridioides 
difficile infection (CDI). However, the risk factors for the development of CDI 
in HF patients have yet to be fully illustrated, especially because of a lack of 
evidence from real-world data.
METHODS: Clinical data and survival situations of HF patients with CDI admitted 
to ICU were extracted from the Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care 
(MIMIC)-IV database. For developing a model that can predict 28-day all-cause 
mortality in HF patients with CDI, the Recursive Feature Elimination with 
Cross-Validation (RFE-CV) method was used for feature selection. And nine 
machine learning (ML) algorithms, including logistic regression (LR), decision 
tree, Bayesian, adaptive boosting, random forest (RF), gradient boosting 
decision tree, XGBoost, light gradient boosting machine, and categorical 
boosting, were applied for model construction. After training and hyperparameter 
optimization of the models through grid search 5-fold cross-validation, the 
performance of models was evaluated by the area under curve (AUC), accuracy, 
sensitivity, specificity, precision, negative predictive value, and F1 score. 
Furthermore, the SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) method was used to 
interpret the optimal model.
RESULTS: A total of 526 HF patients with CDI were included in the study, of whom 
99 cases (18.8%) experienced death within 28 days. Eighteen of the 57 variables 
were selected for the model construction algorithm for model construction. Among 
the ML models considered, the RF model emerged as the optimal model achieving 
the accuracy, F1-score, and AUC values of 0.821, 0.596, and 0.864, respectively. 
The net benefit of the model surpassed other models at 16%-22% threshold 
probabilities based on decision curve analysis. According to the importance of 
features in the RF model, red blood cell distribution width, blood urea 
nitrogen, Simplified Acute Physiology Score II, Sequential Organ Failure 
Assessment, and white blood cell count were highlighted as the five most 
influential variables.
CONCLUSIONS: We developed ML models to predict 28-day all-cause mortality in HF 
patients associated with CDI in the ICU, which are more effective than the 
conventional LR model. The RF model has the best performance among all the ML 
models employed. It may be useful to help clinicians identify high-risk HF 
patients with CDI.

AIMS: The short-term mortality of heart failure (HF) patients admitted to the 
intensive care unit (ICU) is reported to be high. This study aims to explore the 
association between white blood cell-to-haemoglobin ratio (WHR) and 30 day 
mortality from the admission to the ICU.
METHODS AND RESULTS: This retrospective cohort study was performed based on the 
Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care III (MIMIC-III) database (2001-12) 
and MIMIC-IV database (2008-19). Covariables were selected using the least 
absolute shrinkage and selection operator regression. Based on the optimal 
cutoff point selected using the survminer package, WHR was divided into 
high-ratio group (≥1.6) and low-ratio group (<1.6). The association between WHR 
and the risk of 30 day mortality was explored using univariate and multivariable 
Cox regression models. The area under the receiver operating characteristic 
curve (AUC) was calculated to evaluate the prediction performance of WHR. A 
total of 13 702 patients were included. After adjusting the potential 
covariates, high WHR was associated with a greater risk of 30 day mortality 
compared with low WHR [hazard ratio = 1.16, 95% confidence interval (CI): 
1.07-1.27, P < 0.001]. WHR also showed a good performance for the prediction of 
risk of 30 day mortality (AUC = 0.751, 95% CI: 0.746-0.756).
CONCLUSIONS: WHR was positively associated with and performed well to predict 
30 day mortality, indicating that WHR may be a reliable index to assess the 
prognosis of HF patients admitted to the ICU.

BACKGROUND: The objective of this study was to construct a prediction model to 
assess the onset of acute heart failure (AHF) in patients with chronic 
obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) without a history of heart failure and to 
evaluate the predictive value of the nomogram.
METHODS: This study involved 3730 patients with COPD and no history of heart 
failure. Clinical and laboratory data were collected from the Medical 
Information Mart for Intensive Care IV database. The patients were divided into 
a training set (2611 cases) and a validation set (1119 cases) in a 7:3 ratio. 
Least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) regression was used to 
identify potential risk factors for AHF in patients with COPD. These factors 
were then subjected to multivariate logistic regression analysis to develop a 
prediction model for the risk of AHF. The model's differentiation, consistency, 
and clinical applicability were evaluated using receiver operating 
characteristic analysis, a calibration curve, and decision curve analysis (DCA), 
respectively.
RESULTS: LASSO regression identified 10 potential predictors. The concordance 
index was 0.820. The areas under the curves for the training and validation sets 
were 0.8195 and 0.8035, respectively. The calibration curve demonstrated strong 
concordance between the nomogram's predictions and the actual outcomes. DCA 
confirmed the clinical applicability of the nomogram.
CONCLUSION: Our nomogram is a reliable and convenient tool for predicting acute 
heart failure in patients with COPD.

Heart failure is a common complication in patients with sepsis, and individuals 
who experience both sepsis and heart failure are at a heightened risk for 
adverse outcomes. This study aims to develop an effective nomogram model to 
predict the 7-day, 15-day, and 30-day survival probabilities of septic patients 
with heart failure in the intensive care unit (ICU). This study extracted the 
pertinent clinical data of septic patients with heart failure from the Critical 
Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care (MIMIC-IV) database. Patients were 
then randomly allocated into a training set and a test set at a ratio of 7:3. 
Cox proportional hazards regression analysis was used to determine independent 
risk factors influencing patient prognosis and to develop a nomogram model. The 
model's efficacy and clinical significance were assessed through metrics such as 
the concordance index (C-index), time-dependent receiver operating 
characteristic (ROC), calibration curve, and decision curve analysis (DCA). A 
total of 5,490 septic patients with heart failure were included in the study. A 
nomogram model was developed to predict short-term survival probabilities, using 
13 variables: age, pneumonia, endotracheal intubation, mechanical ventilation, 
potassium (K), anion gap (AG), lactate (Lac), activated partial thromboplastin 
time (APTT), white blood cell count (WBC), red cell distribution width (RDW), 
hemoglobin-to-red cell distribution width ratio (HRR), Sequential Organ Failure 
Assessment (SOFA) score, and Charlson Comorbidity Index (CCI). The C-index was 
0.730 (95% CI 0.719-0.742) for the training set and 0.761 (95% CI 0.745-0.776) 
for the test set, indicating strong model accuracy, indicating good model 
accuracy. Evaluations via the ROC curve, calibration curve, and decision curve 
analyses further confirmed the model's reliability and utility. This study 
effectively developed a straightforward and efficient nomogram model to predict 
the 7-day, 15-day, and 30-day survival probabilities of septic patients with 
heart failure in the ICU. The implementation of treatment strategies that 
address the risk factors identified in the model can enhance patient outcomes 
and increase survival rates.

BACKGROUND: Acute kidney injury (AKI) is an important complication in critically 
ill patients, especially in sepsis and septic shock patients. Early prediction 
of AKI in septic shock can provide clinicians with sufficient information for 
timely intervention so that improve the patients' survival rate and quality of 
life. The aim of this study was to establish a nomogram that predicts the risk 
of AKI in patients with septic shock in the intensive care unit (ICU).
METHODS: The data were collected from the Medical Information Mart for Intensive 
Care III (MIMIC-III) database between 2001 and 2012. The primary outcome was AKI 
in the 48 h following ICU admission. Univariate and multivariate logistic 
regression analyses were used to screen the independent risk factors of AKI. The 
performance of the nomogram was evaluated according to the calibration curve, 
receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve, decision curve analysis, and 
clinical impact curve.
RESULTS: A total of 2415 patients with septic shock were included in this study. 
In the training and validation cohort, 1091 (64.48%) of 1690 patients and 475 
(65.52%) of 725 patients developed AKI, respectively. The predictive factors for 
nomogram construction were gender, ethnicity, congestive heart failure, 
diabetes, obesity, Simplified Acute Physiology Score II (SAPS II), 
angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEI) or angiotensin receptor blockers 
(ARBs), bilirubin, creatinine, blood urea nitrogen (BUN), and mechanical 
ventilation. The model had a good discrimination with the area under the ROC 
curve of 0.756 and 0.760 in the training and validation cohorts, respectively. 
The calibration curve for probability of AKI in septic shock showed optimal 
agreement between prediction by nomogram and actual observation. Decision curve 
and clinical impact curve analysis indicated that the nomogram conferred high 
clinical net benefit.
CONCLUSION: The proposed nomogram can quickly and effectively predict the risk 
of AKI at an early stage in patients with septic shock in ICU, which can provide 
information for timely and efficient intervention in patients with septic shock 
in the ICU setting.

BACKGROUND: There is need to identify biomarkers for prognosis of acute 
respiratory distress syndrome (ADRS). This may allow early and accurate 
identification of patients with high-risk ARDS to guide adjustment of clinical 
treatment and nursing intervention, which would ultimately improve prognosis of 
patients with ARDS. Biomarkers based on a combination of fasting glucose and 
lymphocyte counts to predict prognosis in critically ill patients with ARDS 
remain undefined. In this study, we investigated the association between 
glucose-to-lymphocyte ratio (GLR) and in-hospital mortality.
METHODS: The study obtained data from Medical Information Mart for Intensive 
Care-IV (MIMIC-IV Version 1.0) database. We defined the GLR as fasting 
glucose/lymphocyte count and the patient in-hospital mortality was considered as 
the outcome. In addition, we employed linear and logistic regression models for 
analysis.
RESULTS: In total, 1,085 patients with ARDS were included in this study. The 
eligible participants included 498 female and 587 males, with a mean age of 
64.2 ± 17.5 years. Logistic regression analysis demonstrated that higher GLR was 
an independent risk factor for all-cause mortality (OR =1.67, 95% CI: 1.26-2.22) 
after adjusting for age, sex, anion gap, white blood cell count, congestive 
heart failure, sequential organ failure assessment (SOFA), SBP, DBP, and 
respiratory rate in both the dichotomized group and subgroups. We also analyzed 
the in-hospital mortality to ROC curves by comparing the value between 
SOFA + GLR and SOFA. The area under the curve (AUC) was 0.6991 for the 
SOFA + GLR (95% CI: 0.6634-0.7348), and 0.6613 for the SOFA (95% CI: 
0.6238-0.6988).
CONCLUSION: Our data showed that the GLR was an independent predictor of 
in-hospital mortality for patients with ARDS. The GLR is an integrated, readily 
available clinical biomarker for mortality in patients with ARDS.

Background: Atrial fibrillation (AF) and coagulation disorder, two common 
complications of sepsis, are associated with the mortality. However, the 
relationship between early coagulation disorder and AF in sepsis remains 
elusive. This study aimed to evaluate the interaction between AF and early 
coagulation disorder on mortality. Methods: In this retrospective study, all 
data were extracted from the Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care III 
(MIMIC-III) database. Septic patients with coagulation tests during the first 24 
h after admission to intensive care units (ICUs) meeting study criteria were 
included in the analysis. Early coagulation disorder is defined by abnormalities 
in platelet count (PLT), international normalized ratio (INR) and activated 
partial thromboplastin time (APTT) within the first 24 h after admission, whose 
score was defined with reference to sepsis-induced coagulopathy (SIC) and 
coagulopathy. Patients meeting study criteria were divided into AF and non-AF 
groups. Results: In total, 7,528 septic patients were enrolled, including 1,243 
(16.51%) with AF and 5,112 (67.91%) with early coagulation disorder. Compared 
with patients in the non-AF group, patients in the AF group had higher levels of 
INR and APTT (P < 0.001). Multivariable logistic regression analyses showed that 
stroke, early coagulation disorder, age, gender, congestive heart failure (CHF), 
chronic pulmonary disease, renal failure, and chronic liver disease were 
independent risk factors for AF. In addition, AF was related to in-hospital 
mortality and 90-day mortality. In the subgroup analysis stratified by the 
scores of early coagulation disorder, AF was associated with an increased risk 
of 90-day mortality when the scores of early coagulation disorder were 1 or 2 
and 3 or 4. Conclusion: In sepsis, coagulation disorder within the first 24 h 
after admission to the ICUs is an independent risk factor for AF. The effect of 
AF on 90-day mortality varies with the severity of early coagulation disorder.

BACKGROUND: Myocardial infarction (MI) complicated by heart failure (HF) is a 
common and severe clinical condition associated with poor outcomes. Estimated 
plasma volume status (ePVS), a marker of congestion derived from hemoglobin and 
hematocrit, has shown promise in predicting outcomes in various cardiovascular 
diseases. This study aimed to investigate the relationship between ePVS and both 
short-term and long-term prognosis in patients with MI complicated by HF.
METHODS: A retrospective cohort study was conducted using data from the Medical 
Information Mart for Intensive Care IV (MIMIC-IV) database, including 3,238 
patients with MI complicated by HF. Patients were stratified into quartiles 
based on ePVS values. The primary outcomes were in-hospital mortality, 180-day 
mortality, and 1-year mortality. Kaplan-Meier curves, multivariate Cox 
regression analysis, and subgroup analyses were performed to assess the 
relationship between ePVS and outcomes.
RESULTS: Kaplan-Meier analysis showed significant differences in survival rates 
across ePVS quartiles for all outcomes (P < 0.001). Multivariate logistic 
regression analysis revealed that patients in the highest quartile of ePVS (Q4 
vs. Q1) had an independently increased risk of in-hospital mortality (OR 1.58, 
95% CI 1.16-2.13, P = 0.003). Cox regression analysis further demonstrated that 
higher ePVS (Q4 vs. Q1) was associated with an increased risk of 180-day 
mortality (HR 1.45, 95% CI 1.19-1.75, P < 0.001) and 1-year mortality (HR 1.51, 
95% CI 1.27-1.80, P < 0.001). Both Kaplan-Meier survival curves and restricted 
cubic spline models confirmed a positive association between ePVS and long-term 
mortality risks.The association between ePVS and long-term outcomes was stronger 
than for in-hospital mortality. Subgroup analyses revealed that the relationship 
between ePVS and long-term mortality was more pronounced in patients with 
systolic blood pressure below 140 mmHg, lower LODS and OASIS scores, and those 
without hemorrhagic disorders or anemia (P for interaction <0.05).
CONCLUSION: ePVS was an independent predictor of both short-term and long-term 
mortality in patients with MI complicated by HF. Its prognostic value was 
particularly significant for long-term outcomes, suggesting its potential 
utility in risk stratification and guiding treatment strategies for this 
high-risk population.

BACKGROUND: Epidemiological studies have demonstrated an association between red 
blood cell distribution width (RDW) and the prognosis of pneumonia-associated 
diseases. However, prognostic value of RDW in patients with 
ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) has yet to be investigated. This study 
aimed to explore the association between RDW and in-hospital mortality in VAP 
patients and explore predictive value of RDW for VAP patients.
METHODS: This retrospective cohort study included 1,543 VAP patients from the 
Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care IV database 2008-2019. The primary 
outcome was considered to 30-day in-hospital mortality of VAP patients in this 
study. Non-high RDW level group was defined as <15 %, and high RDW level group 
as ≥15%. The possible confounding factors were screened by least absolute 
shrinkage and selection operator regression. Univariate and multivariate COX 
regression analyses were used for the assessment on the association of RDW and 
30-day in-hospital mortality in VAP patients. We also performed subgroup 
analyses. Furthermore, a comparative analysis of RDW and sequential organ 
failure assessment (SOFA) score and simplified acute physiology score II (SAPS 
II) were performed by receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves.
RESULTS: The 30-day in-hospital mortality of VAP patients was approximately 
19.05%. After adjusting all confounding factors, high RDW was associated with 
30-day in-hospital mortality among VAP patients by using non-high RDW as the 
reference [hazard ratio (HR) =1.29, 95% confidence interval (CI): 1.01-1.63]. 
Additionally, the relationship was also robust in several populations, such as 
patients were younger than 60 years, or had not a history of congestive heart 
failure, or had a history of sepsis, or had not received renal replacement 
therapy, or had a duration of mechanical ventilation for more than 7 days. The 
result of ROC indicated that RDW had a better prognostic value in predicting 
30-day in-hospital mortality for VAP patients than SOFA score and SAPS II score.
CONCLUSION: High RDW level is associated with an increased 30-day in-hospital 
mortality. The RDW is a promising biomarker in predicting 30-day in-hospital 
mortality for patients admitted to the ICU, regardless of VAP.

BACKGROUND: Comorbid congestive heart failure (CHF) was associated with worse 
prognosis in patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), while 
few studies specially investigated critically ill patients. This study 
investigated the associations between comorbid COPD with or without CHF and 
prognosis of patients admitted to intensive care units (ICU).
METHODS: We conducted a retrospective cohort study in the Medical Information 
Mart for Intensive Care III database. Adult ICU patients were included and 
categorized as patients without COPD and CHF, patients with COPD but without 
CHF, patients with CHF but without COPD, and patients with both COPD and CHF. 
The study outcomes were 28-day mortality and 90-day mortality after ICU 
admission. Kaplan-Meier curves were plotted to estimate the survival 
distributions between groups and multivariable Cox regression analyses were 
employed to evaluate the associations between comorbid COPD and/or CHF and the 
study outcomes.
RESULTS: A total of 29,589 patients were included with 20,507 patients without 
COPD and CHF, 1575 patients with COPD, 6190 patients with CHF, and 1317 patients 
with both COPD and CHF. The highest 28-day mortality rate and 90-day mortality 
rate were found in patients with both COPD and CHF (15.95% and 25.74%, 
respectively), while patients with COPD and patients with CHF had similar 
mortality rates, also observed in Kaplan-Meier curves. Compared with patients 
without COPD or CHF, comorbid COPD or CHF both significantly increased the risk 
of 28-day mortality and 90-day mortality, but comorbid COPD and CHF together was 
associated with the highest risk of mortality (hazard ratio 1.55 (95% confidence 
interval (CI) 1.33-1.80) and 1.25 (95% CI 1.16-1.35) for 28-day mortality and 
90-day mortality, respectively), while no significant interaction between COPD 
and CHF was found.
CONCLUSION: ICU patients with comorbid COPD or CHF both experienced greater 
mortalities, while these two risk factors seemed to play an independent role.

BACKGROUND: Acute kidney injury (AKI) is a common complication in heart failure 
(HF) patients. Patients with heart failure who experience renal injury tend to 
have a poor prognosis. The objective of this study is to examine the correlation 
between the occurrence of AKI in heart failure patients and different mean 
arterial pressure (MAP) trajectories, with the goal of improving early 
identification and intervention for AKI.
METHODS: A retrospective study was conducted on patients with heart failure 
using data from the Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care IV (MIMIC-IV). 
We utilized the group-based trajectory modeling (GBTM) method to classify the 
24-hour MAP change trajectories in heart failure patients. The occurrence of AKI 
within the first 7 days of intensive care unit (ICU) admission was considered 
the outcome. The impact of MAP trajectories on AKI occurrence in heart failure 
patients was analyzed using Cox proportional hazards models, competing risk 
models, and doubly robust estimation methods.
RESULTS: A cohort of 8,502 HF patients was analyzed, with their 24-hour MAP 
trajectories categorized into five groups: Low MAP group (Class 1), Medium MAP 
group (Class 2), Low-medium MAP group (Class 3), High-to-low MAP group (Class 
4), and High MAP group (Class 5). The results from the doubly robust analysis 
revealed that Class 4 exhibited a significantly increased AKI risk than Class 3 
(HR 1.284, 95% CI 1.085-1.521, p = 0.003; HR 1.271, 95% CI 1.074-1.505, 
p = 0.005). Conversely, the risks of Class 2 were significantly lower than those 
of Class 3 (HR 0.846, 95% CI 0.745-0.960, p = 0.009; HR 0.879, 95% CI 
0.774-0.998, p = 0.047).
CONCLUSIONS: The 24-hour MAP trajectory in HF patients influences the risk of 
AKI. A rapid decrease in MAP (Class 4) is associated with a higher AKI risk, 
while maintaining MAP at a moderate level (Class 2) significantly reduces this 
risk. Therefore, closely monitoring MAP changes is crucial for preventing AKI in 
HF.

OBJECTIVE: Developing and validating a simple and clinically useful dynamic 
nomogram for predicting early acute kidney injury (AKI) in patients with acute 
heart failure (AHF) admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU).
METHODS: Clinical data from patients with AHF were obtained from the Medical 
Information Mart for Intensive Care IV database. The patients with AHF were 
randomly allocated into derivation and validation sets. The independent 
predictors for AKI development in AHF patients were identified through least 
absolute shrinkage and selection operator and multivariate logistic regression 
analyses. A nomogram was developed based on the results of the multivariable 
logistic regression to predict early AKI onset in AHF patients, which was 
subsequently implemented as a web-based calculator for clinical application. An 
evaluation of the nomogram was conducted using discrimination, calibration 
curves, and decision curve analyses (DCA).
RESULTS: After strict screening, 1,338 patients with AHF were included in the 
derivation set, and 3,129 in the validation set. Sepsis, use of human albumin, 
age, mechanical ventilation, aminoglycoside administration, and serum creatinine 
levels were identified as predictive factors for AKI in patients with AHF. The 
discrimination of the nomogram in both the derivation and validation sets was 
0.81 (95% confidence interval: 0.78-0.83) and 0.79 (95% confidence interval: 
0.76-0.83). Additionally, the calibration curve demonstrated that the predicted 
outcomes aligned well with the actual observations. Ultimately, the DCA curves 
indicated that the nomogram exhibited favorable clinical applicability.
CONCLUSION: The nomogram that integrates clinical risk factors and enables the 
personalized prediction of AKI in patients with AHF upon admission to the ICU, 
which has the potential to assist in identifying AHF patients who would derive 
the greatest benefit from interventions aimed at preventing and treating AKI.

BACKGROUND: Medical concepts are inherently ambiguous and error-prone due to 
human fallibility, which makes it hard for them to be fully used by classical 
machine learning methods (eg, for tasks like early stage disease prediction).
OBJECTIVE: Our work was to create a new machine-friendly representation that 
resembles the semantics of medical concepts. We then developed a sequential 
predictive model for medical events based on this new representation.
METHODS: We developed novel contextual embedding techniques to combine different 
medical events (eg, diagnoses, prescriptions, and labs tests). Each medical 
event is converted into a numerical vector that resembles its "semantics," via 
which the similarity between medical events can be easily measured. We developed 
simple and effective predictive models based on these vectors to predict novel 
diagnoses.
RESULTS: We evaluated our sequential prediction model (and standard learning 
methods) in estimating the risk of potential diseases based on our contextual 
embedding representation. Our model achieved an area under the receiver 
operating characteristic (ROC) curve (AUC) of 0.79 on chronic systolic heart 
failure and an average AUC of 0.67 (over the 80 most common diagnoses) using the 
Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care III (MIMIC-III) dataset.
CONCLUSIONS: We propose a general early prognosis predictor for 80 different 
diagnoses. Our method computes numeric representation for each medical event to 
uncover the potential meaning of those events. Our results demonstrate the 
efficiency of the proposed method, which will benefit patients and physicians by 
offering more accurate diagnosis.

OBJECTIVE: To investigate the risk factors affecting the prognosis of patients 
with acute kidney injury (AKI) in the intensive care unit (ICU) based on the 
Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care III (MIMIC-III) database, and to 
establish a prognostic model for AKI.
METHODS: Patients (aged ≥ 18 years) with acute renal failure, admitted to the 
ICU for the first time, and had complete hospital records (the RIFLE diagnostic 
criteria were used in the database, and the diagnosis was expressed as AKI in 
this article) were screened from MIMIC-III database according to diagnostic 
codes. Patients were divided into two groups based on survival state at 
discharge, and the general information, underlying diseases, injury factors, 
vital signs and laboratory indicators within 24 hours after AKI, related 
intervention and prognostic indicators were analyzed. Univariate and 
multivariate Logistic regression analysis were used to determine the risk 
factors affecting mortality in patients with AKI and established a prediction 
model. The receiver operator characteristic curve (ROC curve) was used to 
analyze the predictive value of the prediction model for the prognosis of AKI 
patients.
RESULTS: There were 4 554 patients with AKI included and 862 died, with 
mortality of 18.93%. Univariate Logistic regression analysis was performed for 
factors that might be associated with death in AKI patients, and the results 
showed that age, hypertension, lymphoma, metastatic carcinoma, vancomycin, 
aspirin, coagulation abnormalities, cardiac arrest, sepsis or septic shock, 
invasive mechanical ventilation, white blood cell count (WBC), platelet count 
(PLT), K+, blood urea nitrogen (BUN), total bilirubin (TBil), renal replacement 
therapy (RRT) and length of stay (LOS) were independent risk factors [odds ratio 
(OR) and 95% confidence interval (95%CI) were 1.002 (1.001-1.003), 0.764 
(0.618-0.819), 1.749 (1.112-2.752), 2.606 (1.968-3.451), 1.779 (1.529-2.071), 
0.689 (0.563-0.842), 1.871 (1.590-2.201), 2.468 (1.209-5.036), 2.610 
(2.226-3.060), 2.154 (1.853-2.505), 1.105 (1.009-1.021), 0.998 (0.997-0.998), 
1.132 (1.057-1.212), 1.008 (1.006-1.011), 1.061 (1.049-1.073), 2.142 
(1.793-2.997), 0.805 (0.778-1.113), all P < 0.05]. Further binary Logistic 
regression analysis showed that lymphoma, metastatic cancer, vancomycin, cardiac 
arrest, sepsis or septic shock, coagulation dysfunction, invasive mechanical 
ventilation, increased BUN, increased TBil, increased or decreased blood K+ and 
increased WBC were independent risk factors for death [β values were 0.636, 
1.005, 0.207, 0.894, 0.787, 0.346, 0.686, 0.006, 0.051, 0.085, and 0.009; OR and 
95%CI were 1.889 (1.177-3.031), 2.733 (2.027-3.683), 1.229 (1.040-1.453), 2.445 
(1.165-5.133), 2.197 (1.850-2.610), 1.413 (1.183-1.689), 1.987 (1.688-2.338), 
1.006 (1.003-1.009), 1.052 (1.039-1.065), 1.089 (1.008-1.176), and 1.009 
(1.004-1.015), respectively, all P < 0.05]. The Hosmer-Lemeshow test showed that 
the AKI prognostic model was able to fit the observed data well (P = 0.604). ROC 
curve analysis showed that the area under ROC curve (AUC) of the AKI prognostic 
model was 0.716 (95%CI was 0.697-0.735), when the cut-off value was 0.320, the 
sensitivity was 71.9%, the specificity was 60.1%, the positive likelihood ratio 
was 1.80, and the negative likelihood ratio was 0.47.
CONCLUSIONS: The prognostic prediction model of AKI in critically ill patients 
established and based on the MIMIC-III database may have practical significance 
for prognostic risk assessment of AKI and later intervention.

OBJECTIVE: To investigate the death risk prediction factors of acute 
pancreatitis (AP) patients in intensive care unit (ICU), and to establish a 
death prediction model and evaluate its efficacy.
METHODS: A retrospective cohort study was conducted using the data in the 
Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care-III (MIMIC-III). The clinical data 
of 285 AP patients admitted to the ICU in the database were collected, including 
age, gender, blood routine and blood biochemical indicators, comorbidities, 
simplified acute physiology score III (SAPS III) and hospital prognosis. By 
using univariate analysis, the differences in the clinical data of the patients 
were compared between the two groups. Binary multivariate Logistic regression 
analysis was used to screen out independent predictors of in-hospital death in 
AP patients. A death prediction model was established, and the nomogram was 
drawn. The receiver operator characteristic curve (ROC curve) was plotted, and 
the area under the ROC curve (AUC) was used to test the discrimination of the 
prediction model. In addition, the prediction model was compared with the SAPS 
III score in predicting in-hospital death. The calibration ability of the 
prediction model was evaluated by the Hosmer-Lemeshow goodness of fit test, and 
a calibration map was drawn to show the calibration degree of the prediction 
model.
RESULTS: Among 285 patients with AP, 29 patients died in the hospital and 256 
patients survived. Univariate analysis showed that the patients in the death 
group were older than those in the survival group (years old: 70±17 vs. 58±16), 
and had higher white blood cell count (WBC), total bilirubin (TBil), serum 
creatinine (SCr), blood urea nitrogen (BUN), red blood cell volume distribution 
width (RDW), proportion of congestive heart failure and SAPS III score [WBC 
(×109/L): 18.5 (13.9, 24.3) vs. 13.2 (9.3, 17.9), TBil (μmol/L): 29.1 (15.4, 
66.7) vs. 16.2 (10.3, 29.1), SCr (μmol/L): 114.9 (88.4, 300.6) vs. 79.6 (53.0, 
114.9), BUN (mmol/L): 13.9 (9.3, 17.8) vs. 6.1 (3.7, 9.6), RDW: 0.152 (0.141, 
0.165) vs. 0.141 (0.134, 0.150), congestive heart failure: 34.5% vs. 14.8%, SAPS 
III score: 66 (52, 90) vs. 39 (30, 48), all P < 0.05]. Multivariate Logistic 
regression analysis showed that age [odds ratio (OR) = 1.038, 95% confidence 
interval (95%CI) was 1.005-1.073], WBC (OR = 1.103, 95%CI was 1.038-1.172), TBil 
(OR = 1.247, 95%CI was 1.066-1.459), BUN (OR = 1.034, 95%CI was 1.014-1.055) and 
RDW (OR = 1.344, 95%CI was 1.024-1.764) were independent risk predictors of 
in-hospital death in patients with AP. Logistic regression model was 
established: Logit(P) = 
0.037×age+0.098×WBC+0.221×TBil+0.033×BUN+0.296×RDW-12.133. ROC curve analysis 
showed that the AUC of the Logistic regression model for predicting the 
in-hospital death of patients with AP was 0.870 (95%CI was 0.794-0.946), the 
sensitivity was 86.2%, and the specificity was 78.5%, indicating that the model 
had good predictive performance, and it was superior to the SAPS III score [AUC 
was 0.831 (95%CI was 0.754-0.907), the sensitivity was 82.8%, and the 
specificity was 75.4%]. A nomogram model was established based on the result of 
multivariate Logistic regression analysis. The calibration map showed that the 
calibration curve of the nomogram model was very close to the standard curve, 
with the goodness of fit test: χ2 = 6.986, P = 0.538, indicating that the 
consistency between the predicted death risk of the nomogram model and the 
actual occurrence risk was relatively high.
CONCLUSIONS: The older the AP patient is, the higher the WBC, TBil, BUN, and 
RDW, and the greater the risk of hospital death. The death prediction Logistic 
regression model and nomogram model constructed based on the above indicators 
have good discrimination ability and high accuracy for high-risk patients with 
hospital death, which can accurately predict the probability of death in AP 
patients and provide a basis for prognosis judgment and clinical treatment of AP 
patients.

AIMS: ICD codes are used for classification of hospitalizations. The codes are 
used for administrative, financial, and research purposes. It is known, however, 
that errors occur. Natural language processing (NLP) offers promising solutions 
for optimizing the process. To investigate methods for automatic classification 
of disease in unstructured medical records using NLP and to compare these to 
conventional ICD coding.
METHODS AND RESULTS: Two datasets were used: the open-source Medical Information 
Mart for Intensive Care (MIMIC)-III dataset (n = 55.177) and a dataset from a 
hospital in Belgium (n = 12.706). Automated searches using NLP algorithms were 
performed for the diagnoses 'atrial fibrillation (AF)' and 'heart failure (HF)'. 
Four methods were used: rule-based search, logistic regression, term 
frequency-inverse document frequency (TF-IDF), Extreme Gradient Boosting 
(XGBoost), and Bio-Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers 
(BioBERT). All algorithms were developed on the MIMIC-III dataset. The best 
performing algorithm was then deployed on the Belgian dataset. After 
preprocessing a total of 1438 reports was retained in the Belgian dataset. 
XGBoost on TF-IDF matrix resulted in an accuracy of 0.94 and 0.92 for AF and HF, 
respectively. There were 211 mismatches between algorithm and ICD codes. One 
hundred and three were due to a difference in data availability or differing 
definitions. In the remaining 108 mismatches, 70% were due to incorrect 
labelling by the algorithm and 30% were due to erroneous ICD coding (2% of total 
hospitalizations).
CONCLUSION: A newly developed NLP algorithm attained a high accuracy for 
classifying disease in medical records. XGBoost outperformed the deep learning 
technique BioBERT. NLP algorithms could be used to identify ICD-coding errors 
and optimize and support the ICD-coding process.

BACKGROUND: Increased body mass index (BMI) is associated with better survival 
in patients with acute heart failure (AHF), which is a paradoxical phenomenon. 
However, it is unclear whether different nutritional status affects this 
association.
METHODS: 1325 patients with AHF from the Medical Information Mart for Intensive 
Care III database were retrospectively included. Nutritional status was assessed 
by serum albumin (SA) and prognostic nutritional index (PNI). Patients were 
divided into High-SA (≥ 3.5 g/dL) and Low-SA groups (< 3.5 g/dL), and they also 
were divided into High-PNI (≥ 38) and Low-PNI groups (< 38). Propensity-score 
matching (PSM) was used to control for the effect of baseline confounding 
factors, multifactor regression model was adopted to assess the association of 
nutritional status, BMI, and outcomes in AHF patients.
RESULTS: Of the 1325 patients (mean age 72.4 ± 13.1 years), 52.1% (n = 690) were 
male, 13.1% (n = 173) died in hospital and 23.5% (n = 311) died within 90 days. 
Before PSM, after adjusting for potential confounders, in the High-SA 
population, compared with the under/normal BMI group, overweight and obesity 
were negatively correlated with 90-day mortality, with adjusted hazard ratios 
(HR) of 0.47, 95% confidence interval (CI) (0.30-0.74), P = 0.001; HR 0.45, 
95%CI (0.28-0.72), P = 0.001, respectively. However, this correlation was much 
attenuated in the Low-SA group (overweight BMI: HR 1.06, 95%CI 0.75-1.50, 
P = 0.744; obese BMI: HR 0.86, 95%CI 0.59-1.24, P = 0.413). After PSM, those who 
were overweight or obese in the High-SA group had a 50-58% reduction in 90-day 
risk of death, while the protective effect disappeared in the Low-SA group (HR 
1.09, 95% CI 0.70-1.71; HR 1.02, 95%CI 0.66 - 0.59). Similarly, results were 
similar in analyses using PNI as a nutritional assessment criterion.
CONCLUSION: Overweight or Obesity was associated with lower short-term mortality 
in well-nourished AHF patients, whereas this association was significantly 
attenuated or even disappeared in malnourished patients. Therefore, further 
research is needed for weight loss recommendations for malnourished obese 
patients with AHF.

The present study aimed to explore the association between the 
neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio (NLR) and prognosis of critically ill chronic 
heart failure patients. The records of 5298 patients who met the inclusion 
criteria were extracted from the Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care IV 
database. The primary outcome was 30-days all-cause mortality and the secondary 
outcome was 90-days all-cause mortality. Multivariable logistic regression 
analysis was performed to examine the relationship between NLR and 30-days 
mortality. Subgroup analysis was carried out to identify whether the association 
between NLR and 30-days mortality differed across various subgroups. For 30-days 
mortality, after adjusting for multiple confounders, the odds ratio (OR) (95% 
confidence interval [CI]) for the second (NLR 4.0-8.4) and the third (NLR ≥8.4) 
tertiles were 1.52 (1.13-2.03) and 2.53 (1.92-3.34), respectively, compared with 
the first tertile (NLR <4.0). As for 90-days mortality, the OR for the second 
(NLR 4.0-8.4) was 1.34 (1.07-1.67) and 2.23 (1.81-2.76) for the third (NLR ≥8.4) 
tertiles compared with the reference (NLR<4.0). The interactions between the 
sepsis subgroup and 30-days mortality were significant. Our study concluded that 
the NLR was an independent predictor of 30- and 90-days mortality for critically 
ill patients with chronic heart failure.

BACKGROUND: The association between the hemoglobin-to-red cell distribution 
width ratio (HRR) and mortality in critically ill patients with heart failure 
(HF) and acute kidney injury (AKI) remains uncertain. This research focuses on 
exploring the association between HRR and both short-term and long-term 
all-cause mortality in these patients.
METHODS: Participants were selected from the Medical Information Mart for 
Intensive Care IV (MIMIC-IV) database and categorized into tertiles based on HRR 
values. The primary endpoint was 28-days ICU all-cause mortality. Secondary 
endpoints included 28-days hospital and 90-days hospital all-cause mortality. 
Cox proportional hazards models and restricted cubic splines were used to 
analyze the association between HRR and mortality in patients with HF and AKI. 
Kaplan-Meier survival analysis estimated endpoint differences across tertiles.
RESULTS: A total of 7561 patients were included, with 55.5% being male (n=4199). 
Cox proportional hazards analysis showed a significant link between HRR and both 
short-term and long-term mortality in critically ill patients with HF and AKI. 
This association remained significant after adjusting for confounders. The 
restricted cubic splines model demonstrated a linear relationship between a 
higher HRR index and a reduced mortality risk. Kaplan-Meier survival analysis 
revealed significant differences in short-term and long-term mortality among the 
tertile groups.
CONCLUSION: The study results show a strong association between lower HRR and 
increased short-term and long-term mortality in critically ill patients with 
heart failure and AKI. HRR proves to be a valuable and cost-effective marker for 
identifying high-risk patients.

BACKGROUND: The aim of this study was to explore the relationship between the 
hemoglobin glycation index (HGI) of Congestive Heart Failure (CHF) patients and 
their risk of mortality within 365 days.
PATIENTS AND METHODS: The Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care (MIMIC-IV) 
database supplied the patient data for this study, which was categorized into 
quartiles based on the HGI. The primary endpoint was all-cause mortality within 
a 365-day period. Kaplan-Meier (K-M) analysis was utilized to compare this 
primary endpoint across the four aforementioned groups. The relationship between 
the HGI and the endpoint was examined using restricted cubic splines (RCS) and a 
Cox proportional hazards analysis.
RESULTS: A total of 985 patients were included in this study. HGI was 
significantly associated with 30 days mortality (15.9%; HR, 0.79; 95% CI, 
(0.67~0.92); P=0.003) and 60 days mortality (19.3%; HR, 0.83; 95% CI, 
(0.72~0.96); P=0.011) and 90 days mortality (22.1%; HR, 0.86; 95% CI, 
(0.75~0.99); P=0.031) and 365 days mortality (30.7%; HR, 0.97; 95% CI, 
(0.86~1.09); P=0.611) in patients with critical CHF in the completely adjusted 
Cox proportional risk model. RCS analysis revealed a U-shaped relationship 
between HGI and outcome events. KM curves survival analysis suggests a 
correlation between 30 days and 365 days mortality in HGI and CHF patients.
CONCLUSIONS: A higher HGI has a more protective effect than a low HGI for 
patients with CHF and was directly associated with short-term mortality rates. 
These findings may be helpful in the management of patients with CHF.

OBJECTIVE: Heart rate serves as a critical prognostic factor in heart failure 
(HF) patients. We hypothesise that elevated heart rate in critically ill HF 
patients on discharge from the intensive care unit (ICU) could be linked to 
adverse outcomes.
DESIGN: A single-centre retrospective cohort study.
SETTING: This study used data collected between 2008 and 2019 from the Medical 
Information Mart for Intensive Care IV (V.2.0) Database.
PARTICIPANTS: From the 76 943 ICU stays, we enrolled 2365 patients in this 
study.
PRIMARY AND SECONDARY OUTCOME MEASURES: We observed correlations between 
in-hospital mortality and ICU discharge heart rate of 83.56±15.81 beats per 
minute (bpm) (survivors) vs 93.84±17.28 bpm (non-survivors, p<0.001). Total 
mortality showed similar trends, with 83.67±15.36 bpm (survivors) vs 
85.23±17.25 bpm (non-survivors, p=0.027), as did ICU readmissions at 
83.55±15.77 bpm (non-readmitted) vs 88.64±17.49 bpm (readmitted, p<0.001).
RESULTS: Given multivariate analysis, the ICU discharge heart rate strongly 
predicted in-hospital mortality (HR 1.032 (95% CI 1.022 to 1.041), p<0.001), 
total mortality (HR 1.008 (95% CI 1.004 to 1.013), p<0.001) and ICU readmission 
(HR 1.018 (95% CI 1.010 to 1.025), p<0.001). Patients with an ICU discharge 
heart rate>90 bpm demonstrated significantly higher in-hospital mortality (HR 
2.639 (95% CI 1.898 to 3.669), p<0.001), total mortality (HR 1.342 (95% CI 1.163 
to 1.550), p<0.001) and ICU readmission rates (HR 1.781 (95% CI 1.413 to 2.243), 
p<0.001).
CONCLUSION: The findings suggest that HF patients with an elevated heart rate 
(>90 bpm) at ICU discharge are more likely to experience increased in-hospital 
mortality, total mortality and ICU readmissions, indicating potential negative 
outcomes.

BACKGROUND: It is not uncommon that atrial fibrillation (AF) coexists with left 
bundle branch block (LBBB). Whether LBBB is an independent predictor of poor 
prognosis in AF patients remains undetermined. This study aims to investigate 
the impact of LBBB on the AF-related outcomes in non-valvular AF patients.
METHODS: The clinical data of AF patients were collected from the Medical 
Information Mart for Intensive Care-III (MIMIC-III) database. The frequencies of 
acute arterial embolism events (AEE) and in-hospital cardiac death were compared 
between the non-LBBB and LBBB groups. And, their 1-year mortality was assessed 
through a survival analysis model. Additionally, the two groups were matched in 
a 1:2 ratio by a propensity score matching (PSM) method according to the 
CHA2DS2VASc score and AF type.
RESULTS: 5051 patients diagnosed with non-valvular AF without apparent 
structural heart disease were enrolled in this study, among them, there were 65 
with LBBB which had more AEE (13.8% vs 6.8%, p = 0.04). After PSM, with balanced 
CHA2DS2VASc score and AF type, LBBB was still related with AEE (13.8% vs 3.8%, p 
= 0.02) significantly, and it was also independent of heart failure (HF) (odds 
ratios (OR) 6.38, 95% confidence intervals (CI) [1.10, 36.93], p = 0.04). LBBB 
was also correlated with in-hospital cardiac death (OR 5.33, 95% CI [1.01, 
28.28], p = 0.04). And, the LBBB patients had a lower 1-year survival rate in 
the subgroup of HF (67.6% vs 83.0%, p = 0.06).
CONCLUSIONS: The LBBB was an independent risk factor of AEE and related to 
in-hospital cardiac death and 1-year all-cause mortality in this non-valvular AF 
cohort from MIMIC-III.

AIM: In this study, we evaluated the utility of neutrophil percentage-to-albumin 
ratio (NPAR) in predicting in critically ill patients with acute myocardial 
infarction (AMI).
METHODS: The information of patients were collected from Medical Information 
Mart for Intensive Care III database. Admission NPAR was calculated as 
neutrophil percentage divided by serum albumin. The endpoints of this study were 
30-day, 90-day, 180-day, and 365-day all-cause mortality. Cox proportional 
hazards models and subgroup analyses were used to determine the relationship 
between admission NPAR and these endpoints.
RESULTS: 798 critically ill patients with AMI were enrolled in. After 
adjustments for age, race and gender, higher admission NPAR was associated with 
increased risk of 30-day, 90-day, 180-day, and 365-day all-cause mortality in 
critically ill patients with AMI. And after adjusting for possible confounding 
variables, two different trends have emerged. Stratified by tertiles, high 
admission NPAR was independently associated with 180-day and 365-day all-cause 
mortality in critically ill patients with AMI (tertile 3 vs. tertile 1: adjusted 
HR, 95% CI 1.71, 1.10-2.66, p < 0.05; 1.66, 1.10-2.51, p < 0.05). In other hand, 
stratified by quartiles, highest admission NPAR levels were independently 
associated with 90-day, 180-day and 365-day all-cause mortality (quartile 4 vs. 
quartile 1: adjusted HR, 95% CI 2.36, 1.32-4.23, p < 0.05; 2.58, 1.49-4.47, 
p < 0.05; 2.61, 1.56-4.37, p < 0.05). ROC test showed that admission NPAR had a 
moderate ability to predict all-cause mortality of critically ill patients with 
AMI. No obvious interaction was found by subgroup analysis in most subgroups.
CONCLUSIONS: Admission NPAR was an independent predictor for 180-day and 365-day 
all-cause mortality in critically ill patients with AMI.

Background: While respiratory rate has proven to be a sensitive prognostic 
indicator in ICU settings, its relevance in the context of Acute Myocardial 
Infarction (AMI) patients complicated by Congestive Heart Failure (CHF) remains 
underexplored. Therefore, this study aims to investigate the relationship 
between respiratory rate and in-hospital mortality in this specific patient 
cohort. Methods: This retrospective cohort study utilized the Medical 
Information Mart for Intensive Care-IV database to analyze all AMI patients with 
concomitant CHF. The primary outcome, in-hospital mortality, was assessed 
through multivariate analysis. Logistic regression models, restricted cubic 
spline regression models, and subgroup analyses were employed to explore the 
association between respiratory rate and in-hospital mortality. Results: The 
study encompassed 5056 participants diagnosed with both CHF and AMI. After 
adjusting for confounding variables, each incremental unit rise in respiratory 
rate was associated with an 8% increase in the risk of patient mortality (OR = 
1.08, 95% CI: 1.05∼1.11, P < 0.001). When comparing individuals with respiratory 
rates in the first tertile (≤17 breaths per minute) and the third tertile 
(>17-20 breaths per minute) to those in the second tertile (17-20 breaths per 
minute), the adjusted ORs for in-hospital mortality were 1.09 (95% CI: 
0.82∼1.46, P = 0.546) and 1.62 (95% CI: 1.27∼2.06, P < 0.001), respectively. A 
dose-response relationship depicted a J-shaped curve between respiratory rate 
and the risk of in-hospital mortality, with an inflection point at approximately 
19 breaths per minute. Stratified analyses confirmed the robustness of this 
correlation. Conclusions: This study reveals a J-shaped association between 
respiratory rate and in-hospital mortality in ICU patients suffering from both 
AMI and CHF.

Body temperature (BT) has been utilized to assess patient outcomes across 
various diseases. However, the impact of BT on mortality in the intensive care 
unit (ICU) among patients with congestive heart failure (CHF) and diabetes 
mellitus (DM) remains unclear. We conducted a retrospective cohort study using 
data from the Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care (MIMIC)-IV data set. 
The primary outcome assessed was in-hospital mortality rates. BT was treated as 
a categorical variable in the analyses. The association between BT on ICU 
admission and in-hospital mortality was examined using multivariable logistic 
regression models, restricted cubic spline, and subgroup analysis. The cohort 
comprised 7063 patients with both DM and CHF (3135 females and 3928 males), with 
an average age of 71.5 ± 12.2 years. Comparative analysis of the reference group 
(Q4) revealed increased in-hospital mortality in Q6 and Q1 temperature groups, 
with fully adjusted odds ratios of 2.08 (95% confidence interval [CI]: 
1.45-2.96) and 1.95 (95% CI: 1.35-2.79), respectively. Restricted cubic spline 
analysis demonstrated a U-shaped relationship between temperature on admission 
and mortality risk (p nonlinearity <0.001), with the nadir of risk observed at 
36.8°C. The effect sizes and corresponding CIs below and above the threshold 
were 0.581 (95% CI: 0.434-0.777) and 1.674 (95% CI: 1.204-2.328), respectively. 
Stratified analyses further validated the robustness of this correlation. Our 
study establishes a nonlinear association between BT and in-hospital mortality 
in patients with both CHF and DM, with optimal suitable BT at 36.8°C. Further 
research is necessary to confirm this relationship.

BACKGROUND: The β-receptor blocker is used to treat heart failure (HF), and its 
role in the occurrence of atrial fibrillation (AF) is unclear in patients with 
HF. This study aimed to investigate the relationship between β-receptor blocker 
use and AF in patients with HF.
METHODS: All data was collected from the Medical Information Mart for Intensive 
Care-IV (MIMIC-IV) database. The relationship between β-receptor blocker and AF 
was analyzed by univariate logistic regression, multivariate logistic 
regression, and subgroup analysis. The machine learning algorithm including 
logistic and Random forest was used to analyze the importance of variables in 
AF. The interaction analysis was conducted to determine whether other factors 
influence the relationship between β-receptor blocker and AF.
RESULTS: A total of 953 participants were involved. We found that the use of 
beta-blockers increased the risk of AF this result was not affected by 
confounding factors (OR (95%CI): 2.821[2.014,3.951], p < 0.01). The interaction 
analysis showed that myocardial infarction (MI) and β-receptor blocker had an 
interaction on AF (p for interaction < 0.001). The results of additive and 
multiplicative interaction analysis indicated that β-receptor-blocker use and 
infarction are antagonistic in the development of AF in patients with HF ((S 
(95% CI): 0.283[0.142, 0.563]; AP (95% CI): -1.187[-2.020, -0.354]; RERI (95% 
CI): -2.237[-3.722, -0.752], OR (95% CI):0.374[0.184, 0.772]).
CONCLUSION: This study found that β-receptor blocker use was an important risk 
factor for AF in patients with HF. β-receptor blocker use was antagonistic to MI 
in AF in patients with HF.

BACKGROUND: Heart failure (HF) is a life-threatening complication of 
cardiovascular disease. HF patients are more likely to progress to acute kidney 
injury (AKI) with a poor prognosis. However, it is difficult for doctors to 
distinguish which patients will develop AKI accurately. This study aimed to 
construct a machine learning (ML) model to predict AKI occurrence in HF 
patients.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: The data of HF patients from the Medical Information Mart 
for Intensive Care-IV (MIMIC-IV) database was retrospectively analyzed. A ML 
model was established to predict AKI development using decision tree, random 
forest (RF), support vector machine (SVM), K-nearest neighbor (KNN), and 
logistic regression (LR) algorithms. Thirty-nine demographic, clinical, and 
treatment features were used for model establishment. Accuracy, sensitivity, 
specificity, and the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve 
(AUROC) were used to evaluate the performance of the ML algorithms.
RESULTS: A total of 2,678 HF patients were engaged in this study, of whom 919 
developed AKI. Among 5 ML algorithms, the RF algorithm exhibited the highest 
performance with the AUROC of 0.96. In addition, the Gini index showed that the 
sequential organ function assessment (SOFA) score, partial pressure of oxygen 
(PaO2), and estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) were highly relevant to 
AKI development. Finally, to facilitate clinical application, a simple model was 
constructed using the 10 features screened by the Gini index. The RF algorithm 
also exhibited the highest performance with the AUROC of 0.95.
CONCLUSION: Using the ML model could accurately predict the development of AKI 
in HF patients.

BACKGROUND: The incidence, mortality, and readmission rates for acute heart 
failure (AHF) are high, and the in-hospital mortality for AHF patients in the 
intensive care unit (ICU) is higher. However, there is currently no method to 
accurately predict the mortality of AHF patients.
METHODS: The Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care Ⅳ (MIMIC-Ⅳ) database 
was used to perform a retrospective study. Patients meeting the inclusion 
criteria were identified from the MIMIC-Ⅳ database and randomly divided into a 
training set (n = 3,580, 70%) and a validation set (n = 1,534, 30%). The 
variates collected include demographic data, vital signs, comorbidities, 
laboratory test results, and treatment information within 24 hours of ICU 
admission. By using the least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) 
regression model in the training set, variates that affect the in-hospital 
mortality of AHF patients were screened. Subsequently, in the training set, five 
common machine learning (ML) algorithms were applied to construct models using 
variates selected by LASSO to predict the in-hospital mortality of AHF patients. 
The predictive ability of the models was evaluated for sensitivity, specificity, 
accuracy, the area under the curve of receiver operating characteristics, and 
clinical net benefit in the validation set. To obtain a model with the best 
predictive ability, the predictive ability of common scoring systems was 
compared with the best ML model.
RESULTS: Among the 5,114 patients, in-hospital mortality was 12.5%. Comparing 
the area under the curve, the XGBoost model had the best predictive ability 
among all ML models, and the XGBoost model was chosen as the final model for its 
higher net benefit. Its predictive ability was superior to common scoring 
systems.
CONCLUSIONS: The XGBoost model can effectively predict the in-hospital mortality 
of AHF patients admitted to the ICU, which may assist clinicians in precise 
management and early intervention for patients with AHF to reduce mortality.

BACKGROUND: Studies involving the association of blood albumin with prognosis in 
patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD) during intensive care unit (ICU) were 
scarce.
AIM: We investigated whether reduced blood albumin level independently 
associated with an increased risk of cardiovascular (CV) complications and 
1-year mortality risk in ICU patients with CKD.
METHODS: The Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care III (MIMIC-III) 
database was used. Disease diagnosis and death information among a number of 925 
ICU patients with CKD, who have been measured for blood biochemistry, were 
recorded. Here, multivariable logistic regression Models were structured to 
evaluate the associations between blood albumin levels (first value on 
admission, maximum and minimum value during ICU) and risks for CV complications 
and 1-year mortality among these CKD patients.
RESULTS: In 925 CKD patients, the number of CV complication with heart failure 
(HF), myocardial infarction (MI) or stroke was 470 (50.8%). 406 (43.9%) patients 
were dead during the follow-up of 1 year after patients were discharged. Our 
smooth curve results suggested a curvilinear relation on association between 
blood albumin level and risk of CV complications. The "inflection point" of 
blood albumin level that patients were at highest risk of CV complications was 
3.4 g/dL. The almost linear relationship with a downward trend was observed on 
the association between blood albumin level and 1-year mortality risk. We found 
that reduced blood albumin level contributed to lower risk for CV complications 
and higher risk for 1-year mortality respectively when blood albumin levels in 
CKD patients were below 3.4 g/dL. Additionally, albumin therapy had an obvious 
modifying effect on the independent association, suggesting a possible improved 
effect of albumin therapy on risk of CV complications and 1-year mortality risk 
in these CKD patients.
CONCLUSIONS: Our study reported that reduced blood albumin levels in CKD 
patients during ICU were related to lower risk for CV complications and 
increased risk of 1-year mortality.

Dementia limits timely revascularization in individuals with acute myocardial 
infarction (AMI). However, it remains unclear whether dementia affects prognosis 
negatively in older individuals with AMI in the intensive care unit (ICU). This 
research aimed to evaluate the dementia effect on the outcomes in individuals 
with AMI in ICU.Data from 3,582 patients aged ≥ 65 years with AMI in ICU from 
the Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care IV (MIMIC IV) database were 
evaluated. The independent variable was dementia at baseline, and the primary 
finding was death from any cause during follow-up. A 1:1 propensity score 
matching (PSM) showed 208 participants with and without dementia. The 
correlation between dementia and poor prognosis of AMI was verified using a 
double-robust estimation method.In the PSM cohort, the 30-day all-cause 
mortality was 37.50% and 33.17% in the dementia and non-dementia groups (P = 
0.356), respectively, and the 1-year all-cause mortality was 61.06% and 51.44%, 
respectively (P = 0.048). Cox regression analysis showed no association between 
dementia and elevated 30-day (hazard ratio [HR] 1.15, 95% confidence interval 
[CI] 0.84, 1.60) and 1-year (HR 1.28, 95% CI 0.99, 1.66) all-cause mortality 
after AMI. Similarly, dementia was not connected with in-hospital mortality, 
bleeding, or stroke after AMI. Interaction analysis showed that 1-year all-cause 
mortality was 48.00% higher in individuals with dementia and diabetic 
complications than in those without diabetic complications.Dementia is not an 
independent risk factor for adverse outcomes in AMI. Thus, it may be 
inappropriate to include dementia as a contraindication for invasive AMI 
therapy.

BACKGROUND: Severe acute pancreatitis (SAP) has a mortality of 30% with no 
current targeted therapy. The potential protective effect of insulin on AP has 
been reported and needs to be confirmed. Thus, we aim to examine the effect of 
insulin treatment on the outcome of AP patients.
METHODS: A retrospective study was performed using data from the Medical 
Information Mart for Intensive Care (MIMIC) database. Kruskal-Wallis test, 
t-tests, and Pearson's chi-squared test were used to compare differences between 
groups. Propensity score matching and further nearest neighbor matching were 
used to construct a matched cohort. Cox proportional hazards regression 
analyses, logistic regression analyses, and the doubly robust estimation method 
were used to assess the relationship between insulin use and mortality.
RESULTS: Nine hundred patients were enrolled in the final analysis. Insulin was 
associated with better outcomes in AP patients admitted to ICU, and could act as 
an independent predictor for 30-day mortality (HR = 0.36, 95% CI = 0.24-0.55). 
Subgroup analysis showed that AP patients with heart failure or without kidney 
disease or respiratory failure may not benefit from insulin treatment.
CONCLUSIONS: Insulin treatment is independently associated with lower 30-day 
mortality in AP patients, except for those with heart failure or without kidney 
disease or respiratory failure.

BACKGROUND: Heart failure (HF) is a common cardiovascular disease, which is 
related to systemic inflammation for decades. Fibrinogen (FIB) is a sign of 
thrombosis and inflammation, which is associated with the prognosis of many 
diseases. Nevertheless, the role of fibrinogen level in the prognosis of 
critically ill patients with acute exacerbation of chronic heart failure is 
unclear.
METHODS: The data are from the Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care III 
(MIMIC III) database, which is a freely accessible critical care database. The 
primary outcome in our study was 90-day mortality. The prognostic value of 
fibrinogen was analyzed with receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve 
analysis, Kaplan-Meier curve, and Cox model.
RESULTS: A total of 554 patients were included. Patients were divided into two 
groups, low fibrinogen level (<284 mg/dl) and high fibrinogen level 
(≥284 mg/dl), through the cut-off value of the ROC curve. The area under the ROC 
curve of fibrinogen for predicting 90-day mortality was 0.65 (95% CI: 
0.59-0.70). In the unadjusted Cox model, compared with the low fibrinogen level 
(<284 mg/dl), the 90-day mortality of the hazard ratio (HR) with 95% confidence 
intervals (CI) of the high fibrinogen level is 3.33 (95% CI 2.15-5.15). In 
different multivariable Cox models, compared with the low fibrinogen level 
(<284 mg/dl), the 90-day mortality of the hazard ratio of the high fibrinogen 
level is from 2.83 to 3.13. In subgroup analyses, significant interactions were 
observed only in age, chronic kidney disease (CKD), and APS III scores.
CONCLUSION: Our data suggest that high fibrinogen levels (≥284 mg/dl) 
independently predict mortality in critically ill patients with acute 
exacerbation of chronic heart failure. Our findings need to be further validated 
by large prospective studies and longer follow-up time.

INTRODUCTION: Recent studies have highlighted adverse outcomes of fluid overload 
in critically ill patients. Therefore, its early recognition is essential for 
the management of these patients.
OBJECTIVES: Our aim was to propose a deep learning (DL) model using data from 
noninvasive chest X‑ray (CXR) imaging associated with the fluid overload status.
PATIENTS AND METHODS: We collected data from the Medical Information Mart for 
Intensive Care IV (MIMIC‑IV, v. 1.0) and MIMIC Chest X‑Ray (v. 2.0.0) databases 
for modeling, and from our hospital database for testing. The extravascular lung 
water index (ELWI) greater than 10 ml/kg and the global end-diastolic volume 
index (GEDI) greater than 700 ml/m2 were used as threshold values for the fluid 
overload status. A DL model with a transfer learning strategy was proposed to 
predict the fluid overload status based on CXR images, and compared with 
clinical and semantic label models. Additionally, a visualization technique was 
adopted to determine the important areas of features in the input images.
RESULTS: The DL model showed a relatively strong performance for predicting the 
ELWI (area under the curve [AUC] = 0.896; 95% CI, 0.819-0.972 and AUC = 0.718; 
95% CI, 0.594-0.822, respectively) and the GEDI status (AUC = 0.814; 95% CI, 
0.699-0.930 and AUC = 0.649; 95% CI, 0.510-0.787, respectively) in both the 
primary and the test cohort. The performance was better than that of the 
clinical and semantic label models.
CONCLUSIONS: As CXR is routinely used in the intensive care unit, a simple, 
fast, low‑cost, and noninvasive DL model based on this modality can be regarded 
as an effective supplementary tool for identifying fluid overload, and should be 
widely adopted in the clinical setting, especially when invasive hemodynamic 
monitoring is not available.

Acute myocardial infarction (AMI) in patients with acute kidney injury (AKI) is 
associated with poor long-term outcome. However, the short-term prognosis of AKI 
in patients with ST-elevation AMI (STEMI) needs to be explored further. We 
assessed this relationship between these patients and short-term mortality in 
relation to AKI and chronic kidney disease (CKD). All data were extracted from 
the Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care III database. The primary 
outcome was 28-day mortality. Kaplan-Meier curves, logistic regression models, 
and propensity score matching analysis were used to evaluate the associations 
between AKI in patients with STEMI and outcomes. A total of 1031 patients with 
STEMI met the inclusion criteria. For 28-day mortality, in the multivariable 
logistic regression models, the odds ratio (95% CI) of group 2 (AKI but no CKD) 
and group 3 (AKI in the presence of CKD) were 3.24 (1.46-7.18) and 4.57 
(1.83-11.37), respectively, compared with group 1 (no AKI and no CKD). Comorbid 
AKI increased the risk of short-term mortality among patients with STEMI, 
especially for those with AKI in the presence of CKD.

BACKGROUND AND AIMS: New-onset atrial fibrillation (NOAF) is a common 
manifestation in critically ill patients. There is a paucity of evidence 
indicating a relationship between urinary ketones and NOAF.
METHODS: Critically ill patients with urinary ketone measurements from the 
Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care (MIMIC-IV) database were included. 
The primary outcome was NOAF Propensity score matching was performed following 
by multivariable logistic regression.
RESULTS: A total of 24,688 patients with available data of urine ketone were 
included in this study. The urine ketone of 4014 patients was tested positive. 
The average age of the included participants was 63.8 years old, and 54.5% of 
them were male. Result of the fully-adjusted binary logistic regression model 
showed that patients with positive urinary ketone was associated with a 
significantly lower risk of NOAF (Odds ratio, 0.79, 95% CI 0.7-0.9), compared 
with those with negative urinary ketone. In the subgroup analysis according to 
diabetic status, compared with nondiabetics, patients with diabetes had lower 
risk of NOAF (p-values for interaction < 0.05). Results of other subgroup 
analyses according to gender, age, infection, myocardial infarction, and 
congestive heart failure were consistent with the primary analysis.
CONCLUSIONS: Positive urinary ketone body may be associated with reduced risk of 
NOAF in critically ill patients during intensive care unit hospitalization. 
Further studies are needed to clarify the underlying mechanisms.

INTRODUCTION: Cardiac arrest (CA), characterized by its heterogeneity, poses 
challenges in patient management. This study aimed to identify clinical 
subphenotypes in CA patients to aid in patient classification, prognosis 
assessment, and treatment decision-making.
METHODS: For this study, comprehensive data were extracted from the Medical 
Information Mart for Intensive Care IV (MIMIC-IV) 2.0 database. We excluded 
patients under 18 years old, those not initially admitted to the intensive care 
unit (ICU), or treated in the ICU for less than 72 h. A total of 57 clinical 
parameters relevant to CA patients were selected for analysis. These included 
demographic data, vital signs, and laboratory parameters. After an extensive 
literature review and expert consultations, key factors such as temperature (T), 
sodium (Na), creatinine (CR), glucose (GLU), heart rate (HR), PaO2/FiO2 ratio 
(P/F), hemoglobin (HB), mean arterial pressure (MAP), platelets (PLT), and white 
blood cell count (WBC) were identified as the most significant for cluster 
analysis. Consensus cluster analysis was utilized to examine the mean values of 
these routine clinical parameters within the first 24 h post-ICU admission to 
categorize patient classes. Furthermore, in-hospital and 28-day mortality rates 
of patients across different CA subphenotypes were assessed using multivariate 
logistic and Cox regression analysis.
RESULTS: After applying exclusion criteria, 719 CA patients were included in the 
study, with a median age of 67.22 years (IQR: 55.50-79.34), of whom 63.28% were 
male. The analysis delineated two distinct subphenotypes: Subphenotype 1 (SP1) 
and Subphenotype 2 (SP2). Compared to SP1, patients in SP2 exhibited 
significantly higher levels of P/F, HB, MAP, PLT, and Na, but lower levels of T, 
HR, GLU, WBC, and CR. SP2 patients had a notably higher in-hospital mortality 
rate compared to SP1 (53.01% for SP2 vs. 39.36% for SP1, P < 0.001). 28-day 
mortality decreased continuously for both subphenotypes, with a more rapid 
decline in SP2. These differences remained significant after adjusting for 
potential covariates (adjusted OR = 1.82, 95% CI: 1.26-2.64, P = 0.002; 
HR = 1.84, 95% CI: 1.40-2.41, P < 0.001).
CONCLUSIONS: The study successfully identified two distinct clinical 
subphenotypes of CA by analyzing routine clinical data from the first 24 h 
following ICU admission. SP1 was characterized by a lower rate of in-hospital 
and 28-day mortality when compared to SP2. This differentiation could play a 
crucial role in tailoring patient care, assessing prognosis, and guiding more 
targeted treatment strategies for CA patients.

Previous studies have shown that lactate/albumin ratio (LAR) can be used as a 
prognostic biomarker to independently predict the mortality of sepsis and severe 
heart failure. However, the role of LAR as an independent prognostic factor in 
all-cause mortality in patients with acute respiratory failure (ARF) remains to 
be clarified. Therefore, we retrospectively analyzed 2170 patients with ARF in 
Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care Database III from 2001 to 2012. By 
drawing the receiver operating characteristic curve, LAR shows a better 
predictive value in predicting the 30-day mortality of ARF patients (AUC: 
0.646), which is higher than that of albumin (AUC: 0.631) or lactate (AUC: 
0.616) alone, and even higher than SOFA score(AUC: 0.642). COX regression 
analysis and Kaplan-Meier curve objectively and intuitively show that high LAR 
is a risk factor for patients with ARF, which is positively correlated with 
all-cause mortality. As an easy-to-obtain and objective biomarker, LAR deserves 
further verification by multi-center prospective studies.

Traumatic brain injury (TBI) is a complex condition where heterogeneity impedes 
the advancement of care. Understanding the diverse presentations of TBI is 
crucial for personalized medicine. Our study aimed to identify clinically 
relevant patient endotypes in TBI using latent class analysis based on 
comorbidity data. We used the Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care III 
database, which includes 2,629 adult TBI patients. We identified five stable 
endotypes characterized by specific comorbidity profiles: Heart Failure and 
Arrhythmia, Healthy, Renal Failure with Hypertension, Alcohol Abuse, and 
Hypertension. Each endotype had distinct clinical characteristics and outcomes: 
The Heart Failure and Arrhythmia endotype had lower survival rates than the 
Renal Failure with Hypertension despite featuring fewer comorbidities overall. 
Patients in the Hypertension endotype had higher rates of neurosurgical 
intervention but shorter stays in contrast to the Alcohol Abuse endotype which 
had lower rates of neurosurgical intervention but significantly longer hospital 
stays. Both endotypes had high overall survival rates comparable to the Healthy 
endotype. Logistic regression models showed that endotypes improved the 
predictability of survival compared to individual comorbidities alone. This 
study validates clinical endotypes as an approach to addressing heterogeneity in 
TBI and demonstrates the potential of this methodology in other complex 
conditions.

OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to develop and validate several artificial 
intelligence (AI) models to identify acute myocardial infarction (AMI) patients 
at an increased risk of acute kidney injury (AKI) during hospitalization.
METHODS: Included were patients diagnosed with AMI from the Medical Information 
Mart for Intensive Care (MIMIC) III and IV databases. Two cohorts of AMI 
patients from Changzhou Second People's Hospital and Xuzhou Center Hospital were 
used for external validation of the models. Patients' demographics, vital signs, 
clinical characteristics, laboratory results, and therapeutic measures were 
extracted. Totally, 12 AI models were developed. The area under the receiver 
operating characteristic curve (AUC) were calculated and compared.
RESULTS: AKI occurred during hospitalization in 1098 (28.3 %) of the 3882 final 
enrolled patients, split into training (3105) and test (777) sets randomly. 
Among them, Random Forest (RF), C5.0 and Bagged CART models outperformed the 
other models in both the training and test sets. The AUCs for the test set were 
0.754, 0.734 and 0.730, respectively. The incidence of AKI was 9.8 % and 9.5 % 
in 2202 patients in the Changzhou cohort and 807 patients in the Xuzhou cohort 
with AMI, respectively. The AUCs for patients in the Changzhou cohort were RF, 
0.761; C5.0, 0.733; and bagged CART, 0.725, respectively, and Xuzhou cohort were 
RF, 0.799; C5.0, 0.808; and bagged CART, 0.784, respectively.
CONCLUSION: Several machines learning-based prediction models for AKI after AMI 
were developed and validated. The RF, C5.0 and Bagged CART model performed 
robustly in identifying high-risk patients earlier.

BACKGROUND: Base excess (BE) represents an increase or decrease of alkali 
reserves in plasma to diagnose acid-base disorders, independent of respiratory 
factors. Current findings about the prognostic value of BE on mortality of 
patients with acute myocardial infarction (AMI) are still unclear. The purpose 
of this study was to explore the prognostic significance of BE for short-term 
all-cause mortality in patients with AMI.
METHODS: A total of 2,465 patients diagnosed with AMI in the intensive care unit 
from the Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care III (MIMIC-III) database 
were included in our study, and we explored the association of BE with 28-day 
and 90-day all-cause mortality using Cox regression analysis. We also used 
restricted cubic splines (RCS) to evaluate the relationship between BE and 
hazard ratio (HR). The primary outcomes were 28-day and 90-day all-cause 
mortality.
RESULTS: When stratified according to quantiles, low BE levels at admission were 
strongly associated with higher 28-day and 90-day all-cause mortality. 
Multivariable Cox proportional hazard models revealed that low BE was an 
independent risk factor of 28-day all-cause mortality [HR 4.158, 95% CI 
3.203-5.398 (low vs. normal BE) and HR 1.354, 95% CI 0.896-2.049 (high vs. 
normal BE)] and 90-day all-cause mortality [HR 4.078, 95% CI 3.160-5.263 (low 
vs. normal BE) and HR 1.369, 95% CI 0.917-2.045 (high vs. normal BE)], even 
after adjustment for significant prognostic covariates. The results were also 
consistent in subgroup analysis. RCS revealed an "L-type" relationship between 
BE and 28-day and 90-day all-cause mortality, as well as adjusting for 
confounding variables. Meanwhile, Kaplan-Meier survival curves were stratified 
by combining BE with carbon dioxide partial pressure (PaCO2), and patients had 
the highest mortality in the group which had low BE (< 3.5 mEq/L) and high PaCO2 
(> 45 mmHg) compared with other groups.
CONCLUSION: Our study revealed that low BE was significantly associated with 
28-day and 90-day mortality in patients with AMI and indicated the value of 
stratifying the mortality risk of patients with AMI by BE.

BACKGROUND: A large amount of evidence has shown the necessity of lowering blood 
pressure (BP) in patients with acute cerebral hemorrhage, but whether reducing 
BP contributes to lower short-term and long-term mortality in these patients 
remains uncertain.
AIMS: We aimed to explore the association between BP, including systolic and 
diastolic BP, during intensive care unit (ICU) admission and 1-month and 1-year 
mortality after discharge of patients with cerebral hemorrhage.
METHODS: A total of 1085 patients with cerebral hemorrhage were obtained from 
the Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care III (MIMIC-III) database. 
Maximum and minimum values of systolic and diastolic BP in these patients during 
their ICU stay were recorded, and endpoint events were defined as the 1-month 
mortality and 1-year mortality after the first admission. Multivariable adjusted 
models were performed for the association of BP with the endpoint events.
RESULTS: We observed that patients with hypertension were likely to be older, 
Asian or Black and had worse health insurance and higher systolic BP than those 
without hypertension. The logistic regression analysis showed inverse 
relationships between systolic BP-min (odds ratio (OR) = 0.986, 95% CI 
0.983-0.989, P < 0.001) and diastolic BP-min (OR = 0.975, 95% CI 0.968-0.981, 
P < 0.001) and risks of 1-month, as well as 1-year mortality when controlling 
for confounders including age, sex, race, insurance, heart failure, myocardial 
infarct, malignancy, cerebral infarction, diabetes and chronic kidney disease. 
Furthermore, smooth curve analysis suggested an approximate L-shaped association 
of systolic BP with the risk of 1-month mortality and 1-year mortality. Reducing 
systolic BP in the range of 100-150 mmHg has a lower death risk in these 
patients with cerebral hemorrhage.
CONCLUSION: We observed an L-shaped association between systolic BP levels and 
the risks of 1-month and 1-year mortality in patients with cerebral hemorrhage, 
which supported that lowering BP when treating an acute hypertensive response 
could reduce short-term and long-term mortality.

INTRODUCTION: Inflammation is closely related to adverse outcomes of acute 
myocardial infarction (AMI). This study aimed to evaluate whether 
neutrophil-lymphocyte ratio (NLR) can predict poor prognosis of critical AMI 
patients.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: We designed a retrospective cohort study and extracted 
AMI patients from the "Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care-III" 
database. The primary outcome was 1-year all-cause mortality. The secondary 
outcomes were 90-day and in-hospital all-cause mortalities, and acute kidney 
injury (AKI) incidence. The optimal cut-offs of NLR were picked by X-tile 
software according to the 1-year mortality and patient groups were created: 
low-NLR (< 4.8), high-NLR (4.8 - 21.1), and very high-NLR (> 21.1). Cox and 
modified Poisson regression models were used to evaluate the effect of NLR on 
outcomes in critically AMI patients.
RESULTS: Finally, 782 critical AMI patients were enrolled in this study, and the 
1-year mortality was 32% (249/782). The high- and very high-NLR groups had a 
higher incidence of outcomes than the low-NLR group (P < 0.05). The multivariate 
regression analyses found that the high- and very high-NLR groups had a higher 
risk of 1-year mortality (Hazard ratio (HR) = 1.59, 95% CI: 1.12 to 2.24, P = 
0.009 and HR = 1.73, 95% CI: 1.09 to 2.73, P = 0.020), 90-day mortality (HR = 
1.69, 95% CI: 1.13 to 2.54, P = 0.011 and HR = 1.90, 95% CI: 1.13 to 3.20, P = 
0.016), in-hospital mortality (Relative risk (RR) = 1.77, 95% CI: 1.14 to 2.74, 
P = 0.010 and RR = 2.10, 95% CI: 1.23 to 3.58, P = 0.007), and AKI incidence (RR 
= 1.44, 95% CI: 1.06 to 1.95, P = 0.018 and RR = 1.34, 95% CI: 0.87 to 2.07, P = 
0.180) compared with low-NLR group. NLR retained stable predictive ability in 
sensitivity analyses.
CONCLUSION: Baseline NLR is an independent risk factor for 1-year mortality, 
90-day mortality, in-hospital mortality, and AKI incidence in AMI patients.

BACKGROUND: Given the traditional acceptance of higher central venous pressure 
(CVP) levels, clinicians ignore the incidence of acute kidney injury (AKI). The 
objective of this study was to assess whether elevated CVP is associated with 
increased AKI in critically ill patients with multiple comorbidities.
METHODS: This was a retrospective observational cohort study using data 
collected from the Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care (MIMIC)-III 
open-source clinical database (version 1.4). Critically ill adult patients with 
CVP and serum creatinine measurement records were included. Linear and 
multivariable logistic regression were performed to determine the association 
between elevated CVP and AKI.
RESULTS: A total of 11,135 patients were enrolled in our study. Critically ill 
patients in higher quartiles of mean CVP presented greater KDIGO AKI severity 
stages at 2 and 7 days. Linear regression showed that the CVP quartile was 
positively correlated with the incidence of AKI within 2 (R2 = 0.991, P = 0.004) 
and 7 days (R2 = 0.990, P = 0.005). Furthermore, patients in the highest 
quartile of mean CVP exhibited an increased risk of AKI at 7 days than those in 
the lowest quartile of mean CVP with an odds ratio of 2.80 (95% confidence 
interval: 2.32-3.37) after adjusting for demographics, treatments and 
comorbidities. The adjusted odds of AKI were 1.10 (95% confidence interval: 
1.08-1.12) per 1 mmHg increase in mean CVP.
CONCLUSIONS: Elevated CVP is associated with an increased risk of AKI in 
critically ill patients with multiple comorbidities. The optimal CVP should be 
personalized and maintained at a low level to avoid AKI in critical care 
settings.

BACKGROUND: To construct a nomogram and a Randomized Survival Forest (RSF) model 
for predicting the occurrence of sepsis in patients with cerebral infarction in 
intensive care units (ICUs).
METHODS: A total of 1,963 patients were included from the Medical Information 
Mart for Intensive Care IV database version 2.0 (MIMIC-IV v2.0). Screening 
features based on Cox regression and Lasso regression for nomogram and RSF 
modeling.
RESULTS: Patients were randomly split into a training set (1,374 cases) and a 
validation set (589 cases) at a ratio of 7:3. Risk factors in the nomogram model 
included atenolol, bicarbonate, calcium, clopidogrel, dipyridamole, heart 
failure, lymphocyte percent, midazolam, propofol, rhabdomyolysis, vancomycin, 
white blood cells, and antibiotics. In the training and validation sets, the 
nomogram predicted sepsis on the 3rd day of admission with an AUC of 0.798 and 
0.765 and predicted sepsis on the 7th day with an AUC of 0.808 and 0.736, 
respectively. In the training and validation sets, the RSF model predicted 
sepsis on the 3rd day of admission with an AUC of 0.899 and 0.775 and predicted 
sepsis on the 7th day with an AUC of 0.913 and 0.768, respectively CONCLUSIONS: 
The two models can reliably predict the probability of sepsis in patients with 
cerebral infarction in the intensive care unit, which can help clinicians to 
assess the condition and provide timely medical interventions for patients. The 
RSF model has better performance.

PURPOSE: Anion gap (AG) is a valuable and easily obtained clinical tool for 
differentially diagnosis of acid-base disorders. Current understanding of the 
prognostic impact of AG on mortality after acute myocardial infarction (AMI) is 
limited. We aimed to investigate whether AG is a predictor of short-term and 
long-term all-cause mortality after AMI.
PATIENTS AND METHODS: We examined 1806 patients diagnosed with AMI in intensive 
care unit from the Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care III (MIMIC-III) 
database. We analyzed the association of AG with 30-day, 180-day and 1-year 
all-cause mortality on a continuous scale and in categories, using multivariable 
Cox regression. We utilized restricted cubic splines to evaluate the linearity 
between hazard ratio (HR) and AG concentrations.
RESULTS: AG was associated with a higher risk of 30-day, 180-day and 1-year 
all-cause mortality, with adjusted HRs of 1.083 (95% CI 1.051 to 1.117), 1.077 
(95% CI 1.049 to 1.105), and 1.074 (95% CI 1.047 to 1.101), respectively. The 
results were consistent in subgroup analyses. The association between AG and 
all-cause mortality was linear for 180-day and 1-year mortality, and near linear 
for 30-day mortality, as higher concentrations were associated with high 
all-cause mortality. When stratified according to quartiles, AG was associated 
with 30-day mortality (HR[95% CI]: second quartile, 2.243[1.273, 3.955]; third 
quartile, 3.026[1.763, 5.194]; top quartile, 4.402[2.573, 7.531]), 180-day 
mortality (HR[95% CI]: second quartile, 1.719[1.118, 2.645]; third quartile, 
2.362[1.575, 3.542]; top quartile, 3.116[2.077, 4.676]), and 1-year mortality 
(HR[95% CI]: second quartile, 1.700[1.143, 2.528]; third quartile, 2.239[1.536, 
3.264]; top quartile, 2.876[1.969, 4.201]) using bottom quartile as reference.
CONCLUSION: We firstly demonstrated that higher AG was significantly associated 
with increased 30-day, 180-day and 1-year all-cause mortality in AMI patients. 
AG as an easily obtained marker is of strong and reliable predictive value for 
AMI mortality during follow-up.

AIMS: Previous studies reported that histamine H2 receptor antagonists (H2RAs) 
had cardioprotective effects. However, the effect of H2RAs on mortality of 
critical ill patients with heart failure (HF) remains unclear. The aim of this 
study was to clarify the association between H2RAs and all-cause mortality of 
critical ill patients with HF based on Medical Information Mart for Intensive 
Care III database (MIMIC-III).
METHODS AND RESULTS: Propensity score matching (PSM) was applied to account for 
the baseline differences between two groups that were exposed to H2RAs or not. 
The study primary outcome was all-cause mortality. Kaplan-Meier curves and 
multivariable Cox regression models were employed to estimate the effects of 
H2RAs on mortality of critical ill patients with HF. A total of 10 387 patients 
were included, involving 4440 H2RAs users and 5947 non-H2RAs users. After 
matching, 3130 pairs of patients were matched between H2RAs users and non-H2RAs 
users. The results showed significant association between H2RAs exposure and 
decreased 30-day, 90-day, and 1-year mortality in both univariate analyses and 
multivariate analyses [hazard ratio (HR) = 0.73, 95% confidence interval (CI): 
0.65-0.83 for 30-day; HR = 0.80, 95%CI: 0.72-0.89 for 90-day; and HR = 0.83, 
95%CI: 0.76-0.90 for 1-year mortality, respectively] by Cox regression after 
PSM. Furthermore, stratified analyses revealed that the 30-day, 90-day, and 
1-year mortality of ranitidine users were significantly lower than those of 
famotidine users, respectively.
CONCLUSION: Histamine H2 receptor antagonists exposure was associated with lower 
mortality in critical ill patients with HF. Furthermore, ranitidine might be 
superior to famotidine in reducing mortality of critical ill patients with HF.

BACKGROUND: Frailty is a risk factor for acute myocardial infarction (AMI). This 
study examined the association between the modified frailty index (MFI) and 
adverse outcomes in patients with critical AMI.
METHODS: Data were obtained from the Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care 
IV database. Logistic and Cox regression models and a competing risk model were 
applied.
RESULTS: Of 5003 patients, 1496 were non-frail and 3507 were frail. Frailty was 
significantly associated with in-hospital mortality (per point, OR 1.13, 95% CI: 
1.05-1.21; frail vs non-frail, OR 1.31, 95% CI: 1.04-1.65) and 1-year mortality 
(per point, HR 1.15, 95% CI: 1.11-1.20; frail vs non-frail, HR 1.37, 95% CI: 
1.20-1.58). Frailty was significantly associated with post-discharge care needs 
(per point, OR 1.23, 95% CI: 1.14-1.33; frail vs non-frail, OR 1.47, 95% CI: 
1.22-1.78). In the competing risk models, frailty was significantly associated 
with a lower probability of being discharged from the ICU (per point, HR 0.87, 
95% CI: 0.85-0.90; frail vs non-frail, HR 0.73, 95% CI: 0.68-0.79) and hospital 
(per point, HR 0.82, 95% CI: 0.80-0.85; frail vs non-frail, HR 0.62, 95% CI: 
0.57-0.68). Subgroup analyses showed the association of frailty with in-hospital 
and 1-year mortality was stronger in patients with a SOFA score ≤2 than in those 
with a SOFA score >2 (both p<0.05 for interaction).
CONCLUSION: Frailty assessed by the MFI was an independent predictor of adverse 
outcomes in patients with critical AMI and may be helpful for prognostic risk 
stratification.

OBJECTIVE: Heart failure (HF) complicated by acute kidney injury (AKI) 
significantly impacts patient outcomes, and it is crucial to make early 
predictions of short-term mortality. This study is focused on developing an 
interpretable machine learning model to enhance early prediction accuracy in 
such clinical scenarios.
METHODS: This retrospective cohort study utilized data from the Medical 
Information Mart for Intensive Care Ⅳ (MIMIC-Ⅳ, version 2.0) database. Data from 
the first 24 hours after admission to the ICU were extracted and divided into a 
training set (70%) and a validation set (30%). We utilized the SHapley Additive 
exPlanation (SHAP) method to interpret the workings of an extreme gradient 
boosting (XGBoost) model and identify key prognostic factors. The XGBoost 
model's predictive ability was evaluated against three other machine learning 
models using the area under the curve (AUC) metric, and its interpretation was 
enhanced using the SHAP method.
RESULTS: The study included 8028 patients with HF complicated by AKI. The 
XGBoost model outperformed the other models, achieving an AUC of 0.93 (95% 
confidence interval [CI]: 0.78-0.94; accuracy = 0.89), while neural network 
model showed the worst performance (AUC = 0.79, 95% CI: 0.77-0.82; accuracy = 
0.82). Decision curve analysis showed the superior net benefit of the XGBoost 
model within the 9% to 60% threshold probabilities. SHAP analysis was performed 
to identify the top 20 predictors, with age (mean SHAP value 1.29) and Glasgow 
Coma Scale score (mean SHAP value 1.24) emerging as significant factors.
CONCLUSIONS: Our interpretable model offers an enhanced ability to predict 
mortality risk in HF patients with AKI in ICUs. This model can be used to assist 
in formulating effective treatment plans and optimizing resource allocation.

目的: 开发一种可解释的机器学习模型，以提高心力衰竭（heart failure, HF）合并急性肾损伤（acute kidney injury, 
AKI）患者短期死亡率的早期预测准确性。
方法: 本回顾性队列研究利用了基于电子病历的公开大型数据库重症医学信息数据库MIMIC-Ⅳ（Medical Information Mart for 
Intensive Care Ⅳ, 版本2.0）。提取了患者入住ICU最初24 
h的数据，并将其分为训练集（80%）和验证集（20%）。利用沙普利可加性解释（Shapley additive explanation, 
SHAP）方法解释极端梯度提升（XGBoost）模型的工作原理，并识别关键的预后因素。使用曲线下面积（area under the curve, 
AUC）指标评估XGBoost模型的预测能力，并与3种其他机器学习模型进行比较，其解释性通过SHAP方法得到增强。
结果: 研究包括8028名合并AKI的HF患者。XGBoost模型的表现优于其他模型，达到了0.93的AUC〔95%置信区间（confidence 
interval, CI） 0.78～0.94，准确度=0.89〕，而神经网络的表现最差（AUC=0.79，95%CI 
0.77～0.82，准确度=0.82）。决策曲线分析显示XGBoost模型在9%至80%的阈值概率内具有更高的净收益。SHAP分析识别了前20个预测因素，年龄以及格拉斯哥昏迷评分被识别为重要的因素，SHAP平均值分别为1.29和1.24。
结论: 本研究开发的可解释模型提高了预测ICU内HF患者并发AKI的死亡风险的能力。这个模型不仅有助于制定有效的治疗计划，还能优化资源分配。

OBJECTIVES: To assess the associations of lactate level or lactate clearance at 
different time points with in-hospital mortality in critically ill patients with 
acute myocardial infarction (AMI).
DESIGN: A cohort study.
SETTING: The Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care III database.
PARTICIPANT: 490 AMI patients.
INTERVENTION: None.
PRIMARY AND SECONDARY OUTCOME MEASURES: In-hospital mortality of patients.
RESULTS: In total, 120 (24.49%) patients died at the end of follow-up. After 
adjusting for confounders, increased risk of in-hospital mortality in patients 
with AMI was observed in those with high lactate level (24 hours) (HR=1.156, 
95%CI: 1.002 to 1.333). Increased lactate clearance (24 hours) was correlated 
with a decreased risk of in-hospital mortality in patients with AMI (HR=0.995, 
95% CI: 0.994 to 0.997). The area under the curves (AUCs) of lactate level 
(24 hours) and lactate clearance (24 hours) were 0.689 (95% CI: 0.655 to 0.723) 
and 0.672 (95% CI: 0.637 to 0.706), respectively. The AUC of lactate level 
(24 hours) and lactate clearance (24 hours) was higher than lactate level 
(baseline).
CONCLUSIONS: Increased lactate level (24 hours) was associated with an elevated 
risk of in-hospital mortality in patients with AMI and increased lactate 
clearance (24 hours) was correlated with a decreased risk of in-hospital 
mortality in patients with AMI despite the age and genders.

BACKGROUND: The objective of this study was to evaluate the association between 
red cell distribution width/platelet ratio (RPR) and 30-day and 1-year mortality 
in acute ischemic stroke (AIS).
METHODS: Data for the retrospective cohort study were collected from the Medical 
Information Mart for Intensive Care (MIMIC) III database. RPR was divided into 
two groups: RPR ≤ 0.11 and RPR > 0.11. The study outcomes were 30-day mortality 
and 1-year mortality from AIS. Cox proportional hazard models were utilized to 
assess the association between RPR and mortality. Subgroup analyses were applied 
based on age, tissue-type plasminogen activator (IV-tPA), endovascular 
treatment, and myocardial infarction.
RESULTS: A total of 1,358 patients were included in the study. Short- and 
long-term mortality occurred in 375 (27.61%) and 560 (41.24%) AIS patients, 
respectively. A high RPR was significantly associated with increased 30-day 
[hazard ratio (HR): 1.45, 95% confidence interval (CI): 1.10 to 1.92, P = 0.009] 
and 1-year mortality (HR: 1.54, 95%CI: 1.23 to 1.93, P < 0.001) in AIS patients. 
Meanwhile, RPR was found to be significantly related to 30-day mortality in AIS 
patients aged < 65 years (HR: 2.19, 95% CI: 1.17 to 4.10, P = 0.014), without 
IV-tPA use (HR: 1.42, 95% CI: 1.05 to 1.90, P = 0.021), without using 
endovascular treatment (HR: 1.45, 95% CI: 1.08 to 1.94, P = 0.012), and without 
myocardial infarction (HR: 1.54, 95% CI: 1.13 to 2.10, P = 0.006). Additionally, 
RPR was associated with 1-year mortality in AIS patients aged < 65 years (HR: 
2.54, 95% CI: 1.56 to 4.14, P < 0.001), aged ≥ 65 years (HR: 1.38, 95% CI: 1.06 
to 1.19, P = 0.015), with (HR: 1.46, 95% CI: 1.15 to 1.85, P = 0.002) and 
without using IV-tPA (HR: 2.30, 95% CI: 1.03 to 5.11, P = 0.041), without using 
endovascular treatment (HR: 1.56, 95% CI: 1.23 to 1.96, P < 0.001), and without 
myocardial infarction (HR: 1.68, 95% CI: 1.31 to 2.15, P < 0.001).
CONCLUSION: Elevated RPR is associated with a high risk of short-term and 
long-term mortality in AIS.

The study aims to examine the predictive value of arterial blood lactic acid 
concentration for in-hospital all-cause mortality in the intensive care unit 
(ICU) for patients with acute heart failure (AHF). We retrospectively analyzed 
the clinical data of 7558 AHF patients in the Medical Information Mart for 
Intensive Care IV (MIMIC-IV) database. The exposure variable of the present 
study was arterial blood lactic acid concentration and the outcome variable was 
in-hospital all-cause death. The patients were divided into those who survived 
(n = 6792) and those who died (n = 766). The multivariate logistic regression 
model, restricted cubic spline (RCS) plot, and subgroup analysis were used to 
evaluate the association between lactic acid and in-hospital all-cause 
mortality. In addition, receiver operating curve (ROC) analysis also was 
performed. Finally, we further explore the association between NT-proBNP and 
lactic acid and in-hospital all-cause mortality. Compared with the lowest 
quartiles, the odds ratios with 95% confidence intervals for in-hospital 
all-cause mortality across the quartiles were 1.46 (1.07-2.00), 1.48 
(1.09-2.00), and 2.36 (1.73-3.22) for lactic acid, and in-hospital all-cause 
mortality was gradually increased with lactic acid levels increasing (P for 
trend <0.05). The RCS plot revealed a positive and linear connection between 
lactic acid and in-hospital all-cause mortality. A combination of lactic acid 
concentration and the Simplified Acute Physiology Score (SAPS) II may improve 
the predictive value of in-hospital all-cause mortality in patients with AHF 
(AUC = 0.696). Among subgroups, respiratory failure interacted with an 
association between lactic acid and in-hospital all-cause mortality (P for 
interaction <0.05). The correlation heatmap revealed that NT-proBNP was 
positively correlated with lactic acid (r = 0.07) and positively correlated with 
in-hospital all-cause mortality (r = 0.18). There was an inverse L-shaped curve 
relationship between NT-proBNP and in-hospital all-cause mortality, 
respectively. Mediation analysis suggested that a positive relationship between 
lactic acid and in-hospital all-cause death was mediated by NT-proBNP. For AHF 
patients in the ICU, the arterial blood lactic acid concentration during 
hospitalization was a significant independent predictor of in-hospital all-cause 
mortality. The combination of lactic acid and SAPS II can improve the predictive 
value of the risk of in-hospital all-cause mortality in patients with AHF.

BACKGROUND: Acute myocardial infarction (AMI) and cancer are diseases with high 
morbidity and mortality worldwide, bringing a serious economic burden, and they 
share some risk factors. The purpose of this study was to determine the effect 
of cancer on the all-cause in-hospital mortality of patients with AMI.
METHODS: This multicenter retrospective study analyzed patients with AMI from 
the Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care IV (MIMIC-IV) database and eICU 
Collaborative Research Database (eICU-CRD) in the United States. Patients were 
divided into two groups based on whether they had concomitant malignant cancer: 
cancer and noncancer groups. The outcome was all-cause in-hospital mortality. 
The association between the two groups and their outcomes were analyzed using 
Kaplan-Meier and Cox proportional-hazards regression models. Propensity score 
matching (PSM) and propensity score based inverse probability of treatment 
weighting (IPTW) were used to further adjust for confounding variables to verify 
the stability of the results.
RESULTS: The study included 3,034 and 5,968 patients with AMI from the MIMIC-IV 
database and the eICU-CRD, respectively. Kaplan-Meier survival curves indicated 
that the probability of in-hospital survival was lower in patients with cancer 
than in those without cancer. After adjusting for potential confounding 
variables using multivariable Cox proportional hazards regression, the risk of 
all-cause in-hospital mortality was significantly higher in the cancer than the 
noncancer group, and the HR (95% CI) values for the cancer group were 
1.56(1.22,1.98) and 1.35(1.01,1.79) in the MIMIC-IV database and the eICU-CRD, 
respectively. The same results were obtained after using PSM and IPTW, which 
further verified the results.
CONCLUSIONS: Among the patients with AMI, the all-cause in-hospital mortality 
risk of those with cancer was higher than those without cancer. Therefore, when 
treating such patients, comprehensive considerations should be made from a 
multidisciplinary perspective involving cardiology and oncology, with the 
treatment plan adjusted accordingly.

BACKGROUND: This study aimed to develop and validate a nomogram for predicting 
acute kidney injury (AKI) during the Intensive Care Unit (ICU) stay of patients 
with diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA).
METHODS: A total of 760 patients diagnosed with DKA from the Medical Information 
Mart for Intensive Care III (MIMIC-III) database were included and randomly 
divided into a training set (70%, n = 532) and a validation set (30%, n = 228). 
Clinical characteristics of the data set were utilized to establish a nomogram 
for the prediction of AKI during ICU stay. The least absolute shrinkage and 
selection operator (LASSO) regression was utilized to identified candidate 
predictors. Meanwhile, a multivariate logistic regression analysis was performed 
based on variables derived from LASSO regression, in which variables with 
P < 0.1 were included in the final model. Then, a nomogram was constructed 
applying these significant risk predictors based on a multivariate logistic 
regression model. The discriminatory ability of the model was determined by 
illustrating a receiver operating curve (ROC) and calculating the area under the 
curve (AUC). Moreover, the calibration plot and Hosmer-Lemeshow goodness-of-fit 
test (HL test) were conducted to evaluate the performance of our newly bullied 
nomogram. Decision curve analysis (DCA) was performed to evaluate the clinical 
net benefit.
RESULTS: A multivariable model that included type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM), 
microangiopathy, history of congestive heart failure (CHF), history of 
hypertension, diastolic blood pressure (DBP), urine output, Glasgow coma scale 
(GCS), and respiratory rate (RR) was represented as the nomogram. The predictive 
model demonstrated satisfied discrimination with an AUC of 0.747 (95% CI, 
0.706-0.789) in the training dataset, and 0.712 (95% CI, 0.642-0.782) in the 
validation set. The nomogram showed well-calibrated according to the calibration 
plot and HL test (P > 0.05). DCA showed that our model was clinically useful.
CONCLUSION: The nomogram predicted model for predicting AKI in patients with DKA 
was constructed. This predicted model can help clinical physicians to identify 
the patients with high risk earlier and prevent the occurrence of AKI and 
intervene timely to improve prognosis.

BACKGROUND: Alactic base excess (ABE) is a novel biomarker to evaluate the renal 
capability of handling acid-base disturbances, which has been found to be 
associated with adverse prognosis of sepsis and shock patients. This study aimed 
to evaluate the association between ABE and the risk of in-hospital mortality in 
patients with acute myocardial infarction (AMI).
METHODS: This retrospective cohort study collected AMI patients' clinical data 
from the Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care (MIMIC)-IV database. The 
outcome was in-hospital mortality after intensive care unit (ICU) admission. 
Univariate and multivariate Cox proportional hazards models were performed to 
assess the association of ABE with in-hospital mortality in AMI patients, with 
hazard ratios (HRs) and 95% confidence intervals (CI). To further explore the 
association, subgroup analyses were performed based on age, AKI, eGFR, sepsis, 
and AMI subtypes.
RESULTS: Of the total 2779 AMI patients, 502 died in hospital. Negative ABE 
(HR = 1.26, 95%CI: 1.02-1.56) (neutral ABE as reference) was associated with a 
higher risk of in-hospital mortality in AMI patients, but not in positive ABE 
(P = 0.378). Subgroup analyses showed that negative ABE was significantly 
associated with a higher risk of in-hospital mortality in AMI patients aged>65 
years (HR = 1.46, 95%CI: 1.13-1.89), with eGFR<60 (HR = 1.35, 95%CI: 1.05-1.74), 
with AKI (HR = 1.32, 95%CI: 1.06-1.64), with ST-segment elevation acute 
myocardial infarction (STEMI) subtype (HR = 1.79, 95%CI: 1.18-2.72), and without 
sepsis (HR = 1.29, 95%CI: 1.01-1.64).
CONCLUSION: Negative ABE was significantly associated with in-hospital mortality 
in patients with AMI.

OBJECTIVE: To explore the risk factors of severe acute kidney injury (AKI) in 
septic patients, and to establish an hour-specific prediction model.
METHODS: Based on the information of septic patients in the Medical Information 
Mart for Intensive Care- IV (MIMIC- IV) database, general information, 
comorbidities, vital signs, severity scoring system, laboratory indicators, 
invasive operations and medication use were recorded. The enrolled patients were 
randomized into a training set and a validation set according to a ratio of 7 : 
3. AKI was diagnosed according to the guidelines of Kidney Disease: Improving 
Global Outcome (KDIGO). Based on Lasso regression and Cox regression, the risk 
factors of severe AKI (AKI stage 2 and stage 3) in septic patients were analyzed 
and hour-specific prediction model were established. Consistency index 
(C-index), area under the receiver operator characteristic curve (AUC) and 
calibration curve were used to assess the predictive efficacy of the model.
RESULTS: A total of 20 551 septic patients were enrolled, including 14 385 
patients in the training set and 6 166 patients in the validation set. 
Multivariate Cox regression analysis showed that atrial fibrillation [hazard 
ratio (HR) = 1.266, 95% confidence interval (95%CI) was 1.150-1.393], heart 
failure (HR = 1.348, 95%CI was 1.217-1.493), respiratory failure (HR = 1.565, 
95%CI was 1.428-1.715), heart rate (HR = 1.004, 95%CI was 1.002-1.007), mean 
arterial pressure (HR = 1.245, 95%CI was 1.126-1.377), lactic acid (HR = 1.051, 
95%CI was 1.025-1.077), simplified acute physiology score II (SAPS II, HR = 
1.019, 95%CI was 1.016-1.023), serum creatinine (HR = 1.171, 95%CI was 
1.127-1.216), anion gap (HR = 1.024, 95%CI was 1.010-1.038), serum potassium (HR 
= 1.155, 95%CI was 1.079-1.236), white blood cell count (HR = 1.006, 95%CI was 
1.003-1.009) and furosemide use (HR = 0.414, 95%CI was 0.368-0.467) were 
independently associated with severe AKI in septic patients (all P < 0.01). The 
above predictors were applied to construct an hour-specific prediction model for 
the occurrence of severe AKI in septic patients. The C-index of the prediction 
model was 0.723 and 0.735 in the training and validation sets, respectively. The 
AUC for the occurrence of severe AKI at 12, 24, and 48 hours were 0.795 (95%CI 
was 0.782-0.808), 0.792 (95%CI was 0.780-0.805), and 0.775 (95%CI was 
0.762-0.788) in the training set, and the AUC were 0.803 (95%CI was 
0.784-0.823), 0.791 (95%CI was 0.772-0.810), and 0.773 (95%CI was 0.752-0.793) 
in the validation set, respectively. The calibration curves of the two cohorts 
were in good agreement.
CONCLUSIONS: The hour-specific prediction model effectively identifies high-risk 
septic patients for developing severe AKI within 48 hours, aiding clinicians in 
stratifying patients for early therapeutic interventions to improve outcomes.

BACKGROUND: In updated international guidelines, combined albumin resuscitation 
is recommended for septic shock patients who receive large volumes of 
crystalloids, but minimal data exist on albumin use and the optimal timing in 
those with cardiogenic shock (CS). The objective of this study was to evaluate 
the relationship between resuscitation with a combination of albumin within 24 h 
and 30-day mortality in CS patients.
METHODS: We screened patients with CS from the Medical Information Mart for 
Intensive Care IV (MIMIC-IV) database. Multivariable Cox proportional hazards 
models and propensity score matching (PSM) were employed to explore associations 
between combined albumin resuscitation within 24 h and 30-day mortality in CS. 
Models adjusted for CS considered potential confounders. E-value analysis 
suggested for unmeasured confounding.
RESULTS: We categorized 1,332 and 254 patients into crystalloid-only and early 
albumin combination groups, respectively. Patients who received the albumin 
combination had decreased 30-day and 60-day mortality (21.7 vs. 32.4% and 25.2 
vs. 34.2%, respectively, P < 0.001), and the results were robust after PSM (21.3 
vs. 44.7% and 24.9 vs. 47.0%, respectively, P < 0.001) and following E-value. 
Stratified analysis showed that only ≥ 60 years old patients benefited from 
administration early albumin. In the early albumin combination group, the hazard 
ratios (HRs) of different adjusted covariates remained significant (HRs of 
0.45-0.64, P < 0.05). Subgroup analysis showed that resuscitation with 
combination albumin was significantly associated with reduced 30-day mortality 
in patients with maximum sequential organ failure assessment score≥10, with 
acute myocardial infarction, without an Impella or intra-aortic balloon pump, 
and with or without furosemide and mechanical ventilation (HRs of 0.49, 0.58, 
0.65, 0.40, 0.65 and 0.48, respectively; P < 0.001).
CONCLUSION: This study found, compared with those given crystalloid-only, 
resuscitation with combination albumin within 24 h is associated with lower 
30-day mortality of CS patients aged≥60. The results should be conducted to 
further assess in randomized controlled trials.

Background: Our previous study reported that histamine H2 receptor antagonists 
(H2RAs) exposure was associated with decreased mortality in critically ill 
patients with heart failure (HF) through the same pharmacological mechanism as 
β-blockers. However, population-based clinical study directly comparing the 
efficacy of H2RAs and β-blockers on mortality of HF patients are still lacking. 
This study aims to compare the association difference of H2RAs and β-blockers on 
mortality in critically ill patients with HF using the Medical Information Mart 
for Intensive Care III database (MIMIC-III). Methods: Study population was 
divided into 4 groups: β-blockers + H2RAs group, β-blockers group, H2RAs group, 
and Non-β-blockers + Non-H2RAs group. Kaplan-Meier curves and multivariable Cox 
regression models were employed to evaluate the differences of all-cause 
mortalities among the 4 groups. Propensity score matching (PSM) was used to 
increase comparability of four groups. Results: A total of 5593 patients were 
included. After PSM, multivariate analyses showed that patients in H2RAs group 
had close all-cause mortality with patients in β-blockers group. Furthermore, 
30-day, 1-year, 5-year and 10-year all-mortality of patients in β-blockers + 
H2RAs group were significantly lower than those of patients in β-blockers group, 
respectively (HR: 0.64, 95%CI: 0.50-0.82 for 30-day; HR: 0.80, 95%CI: 0.69-0.93 
for 1-year mortality; HR: 0.83, 95%CI: 0.74-0.93 for 5-year mortality; and HR: 
0.85, 95%CI: 0.76-0.94 for 10-year mortality, respectively). Conclusion: H2RAs 
exposure exhibited comparable all-cause mortality-decreasing effect as 
β-blockers; and, furthermore, H2RAs and β-blockers had additive or synergistic 
interactions to improve survival in critically ill patients with HF.

OBJECTIVE: To investigate the correlation of monocyte/lymphocyte ratio (MLR) 
with the prognosis and adverse event in critically ill patients.
METHODS: Basic information of patients were extracted from Medical Information 
Mart for Intensive Care-III (MIMIC-III), including demographics, blood routine, 
biochemical indexes, systemic inflammatory response syndrome score (SIRS), 
sequential organ failure assessment (SOFA) score, and outcome, etc. MLR on the 
first day of intensive care unit (ICU) admission was calculated. The receiver 
operating characteristic curve (ROC curve) was applied to evaluate the 
prognostic value of MLR on the 30-day mortality and its cut-off value. According 
to the cut-off value, the patients were divided into two groups, and the 
differences between the groups were compared. Logistic regression model was used 
to analyze the relationship of MLR with 30-day mortality, continuous renal 
replacement therapy (CRRT), mechanical ventilation, the length of ICU stay, and 
total hospitalization time.
RESULTS: (1) A total of 43 174 critically ill patients were included. ROC curve 
showed that area under ROC curve (AUC) of MLR in predicting 30-day mortality was 
0.655 [95% confidence interval (95%CI) was 0.632-0.687]. The cut-off value of 
MLR calculated according to the maximum Yoden index was 0.5. There were 16 948 
patients with MLR ≥ 0.5 (high MLR group) and 26 226 patients with MLR < 0.5 (low 
MLR group). (2) Compared with the low MLR group, the high MLR group had higher 
age, proportion of male, body mass index (BMI) [age (years old): 66.0 (51.7, 
78.4) vs. 57.6 (27.1, 74.6), proportion of male: 57.2% vs. 52.5%, BMI (kg/m2): 
26.5 (22.5, 31.1) vs. 24.7 (14.3, 29.7)]. The high MLR group also had higher 
incidence of complications (hypertension: 49.2% vs. 44.6%, chronic heart 
failure: 32.6% vs. 21.7%, diabetes mellitus: 27.0% vs. 23.4%, chronic 
obstructive pulmonary disease: 21.5% vs. 16.1%, renal insufficiency: 19.3% vs. 
13.1%), and higher white blood cell count (WBC), blood glucose, lactate (Lac), 
serum creatinine (SCr), SIRS score and SOFA score [WBC (×109/L): 13.8 (9.6, 
19.2) vs. 11.5 (8.4, 15.6), blood glucose (mmol/L): 8.66 (6.88, 11.49) vs. 8.27 
(6.55, 10.88), Lac (mmol/L): 2.2 (1.5, 3.7) vs. 2.1 (1.4, 3.3), SCr (μmol/L): 
106.1 (70.7, 176.8) vs. 88.4 (70.7, 132.6), SIRS score: 3 (2, 4) vs. 2 (2, 3), 
SOFA score: 4 (2, 7) vs. 3 (1, 5)]. The 30-day mortality, and the proportion of 
patients with length of ICU stay > 5 days, total hospitalization time > 14 days, 
CRRT and mechanical ventilation > 5 days were significantly higher in high MLR 
group (30-day mortality: 20.0% vs. 8.3%, length of ICU stay > 5 days: 33.2% vs. 
20.4%, total hospitalization time > 14 days: 33.7% vs. 16.2%, CRRT: 3.6% vs. 
0.7%, mechanical ventilation > 5 days: 18.4% vs. 5.7%), with statistically 
significant differences (all P < 0.05). (3) After adjusted with the related 
factors, multivariate Logistic regression analysis showed that elevated MLR was 
an independent risk factor for increased 30-day mortality [odd ratio (OR) = 
1.54, 95%CI was 1.37-1.72, P < 0.001]. Moreover, the increased MLR was 
independently associated with the increased risk of usage of CRRT (OR = 2.77, 
95%CI was 2.18-3.51), mechanical ventilation > 5 days (OR = 2.45, 95%CI was 
2.21-2.72), the length of ICU stay > 5 days (OR = 2.29, 95%CI was 2.10-2.49), 
and total hospitalization time > 14 days (OR = 2.28, 95%CI was 2.08-2.49), all P 
< 0.001.
CONCLUSIONS: Retrospective analysis of large sample shows that MLR elevation is 
an independent risk factor for 30-day mortality, usage of CRRT, prolonged 
mechanical ventilation time, prolonged hospitalization, prolonged length of ICU 
stay. MLR can be used for risk stratification of severe patients.

BACKGROUND: Despite the significance and prevalence of acute respiratory 
distress syndrome (ARDS), its detection remains highly variable and 
inconsistent. In this work, we aim to develop an algorithm (ARDSFlag) to 
automate the diagnosis of ARDS based on the Berlin definition. We also aim to 
develop a visualization tool that helps clinicians efficiently assess ARDS 
criteria.
METHODS: ARDSFlag applies machine learning (ML) and natural language processing 
(NLP) techniques to evaluate Berlin criteria by incorporating structured and 
unstructured data in an electronic health record (EHR) system. The study cohort 
includes 19,534 ICU admissions in the Medical Information Mart for Intensive 
Care III (MIMIC-III) database. The output is the ARDS diagnosis, onset time, and 
severity.
RESULTS: ARDSFlag includes separate text classifiers trained using large 
training sets to find evidence of bilateral infiltrates in radiology reports 
(accuracy of 91.9%±0.5%) and heart failure/fluid overload in radiology reports 
(accuracy 86.1%±0.5%) and echocardiogram notes (accuracy 98.4%±0.3%). A test set 
of 300 cases, which was blindly and independently labeled for ARDS by two groups 
of clinicians, shows that ARDSFlag generates an overall accuracy of 89.0% 
(specificity = 91.7%, recall = 80.3%, and precision = 75.0%) in detecting ARDS 
cases.
CONCLUSION: To our best knowledge, this is the first study to focus on 
developing a method to automate the detection of ARDS. Some studies have 
developed and used other methods to answer other research questions. Expectedly, 
ARDSFlag generates a significantly higher performance in all accuracy measures 
compared to those methods.

OBJECTIVE: The aim in this study was to stratify maximum blood glucose levels to 
identify the the best cut-off value of glucose levels to predict mortality in 
acute coronary syndrome (ACS) patients, regardless of whether they had diabetes.
DESIGN: A retrospective cohort study.
SETTING: All clinical data were obtained from the 'Medical Information Mart for 
Intensive Care III' database.
PARTICIPANTS: A total of 3078 patients with ACS were included in the study. We 
divided the patients into four levels based on their maximum blood glucose 
levels (glucosemax), then analysed the relationship between each group with 
mortality.
RESULTS: Among enrolled patients, 2780 and 298 were survivors and non-survivors, 
respectively. Blood glucose levels and mortality showed a 'tick' type 
relationship, with levels 3 and 4 found to be closely associated with increased 
hospital mortality (p<0.05), relative to level 1 (<6.1 mmol/L), used as the 
reference group. No significant association was observed in mortality between 
level 2 and level 1 (p=0.095). In addition, we found a gradual increase in OR 
for level 2 (OR: 2.42, 95% CI 0.86 to 6.80, p=0.095), level 3 (OR: 4.33, 95% CI 
1.55 to 12.13, p=0.005) and level 4 (OR: 7.27, 95% CI 2.56 to 20.62, p<0.001), 
relative to level 1. Based on receiver operating characteristic curves, the 
optimal cut-off value for predicting mortality were 11.5 (area under curve 
(AUC)=0.724), 11.2 (AUC=0.729), 13.4 (AUC=0.638), 15.8 (AUC=0.717) and 
11.3 mmol/L (AUC=0.764) in all ACS, acute myocardial infarction, unstable 
angina, diabetes and non-diabetes patients, respectively. The results of 
subgroup analysis suggested that in patients with significantly elevated blood 
glucose, the mortality of non-diabetes was higher than patients with diabetes 
(OR: 0.42, 95% CI 0.31 to 0.57, p<0.001).
CONCLUSION: Overall, glucosemax ≥11.5 mmol/L had a significant association with 
increased mortality in patients with ACS. Non-diabetes ACS patients need a more 
robust blood glucose management strategy compared with diabetes counterparts.

OBJECTIVES: Acute kidney injury (AKI) is common following cardiac surgery. The 
aim was to investigate the characteristics of AKI that occurred within 48 h and 
during 48 h to 7 days after cardiac surgery.
METHODS: Patient data were extracted from Medical Information Mart for Intensive 
Care III database. AKI was defined according to the Kidney Disease Improving 
Global Outcomes guideline and divided into early (within 48 h) and late (during 
48 h to 7 days) AKI. Multivariable logistic regression models were established 
to investigate risk factors for AKI. Cox proportional hazards model was used to 
analyse 90-day survival.
RESULTS: AKI occurred in 51.2% (2741/5356) patients within the first 7 days 
following cardiac surgery, with the peak occurrence at 36-48 h. The incidence of 
early and late AKI was 41.9% and 9.2%, respectively. Patients with late AKI were 
older and had more comorbidities compared to early AKI patients. Risk factors 
associated with early AKI included age, body mass index, congestive heart 
failure and diabetes. While late AKI was related to atrial fibrillation, 
estimated glomerular filtration rate, sepsis, norepinephrine, mechanical 
ventilation and packed red blood cell transfusion. In Cox proportional model, 
both late and early AKIs were independently associated with 90-day mortality, 
and patients with early AKI had better survival than those with late AKI.
CONCLUSIONS: AKI that occurred earlier was distinguishable from AKI that 
occurred later after cardiac surgery. Time frame should be taken into 
consideration.

PURPOSE: Previous studies showed that long-term use of proton pump inhibitors 
(PPIs) was associated with cardiovascular events. However, the impact of 
short-term PPI exposure on intensive care unit (ICU) patients with myocardial 
infarction (MI) remains largely unknown. This study aims to determine the 
precise correlation between short-term PPI usage during hospitalization and 
prognostic outcomes of ICU-admitted MI patients using Medical Information Mart 
for Intensive Care IV database (MIMIC-IV).
METHODS: Propensity score matching (PSM) was applied to adjust confounding 
factors. The primary study outcome was rehospitalization with mortality and 
length of stay as secondary outcomes. Binary logistic, multivariable Cox, and 
linear regression analyses were employed to estimate the impact of short-term 
PPI exposure on ICU-admitted MI patients.
RESULTS: A total of 7249 patients were included, involving 3628 PPI users and 
3621 non-PPI users. After PSM, 2687 pairs of patients were matched. The results 
demonstrated a significant association between PPI exposure and increased risk 
of rehospitalization for MI in both univariate and multivariate [odds ratio 
(OR) = 1.157, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.020-1.313] analyses through 
logistic regression after PSM. Furthermore, this risk was also observed in 
patients using PPIs > 7 days, despite decreased risk of all-cause mortality 
among these patients. It was also found that pantoprazole increased the risk of 
rehospitalization, whereas omeprazole did not.
CONCLUSION: Short-term PPI usage during hospitalization was still associated 
with higher risk of rehospitalization for MI in ICU-admitted MI patients. 
Furthermore, omeprazole might be superior to pantoprazole regarding the risk of 
rehospitalization in ICU-admitted MI patients.

INTRODUCTION: Few studies have investigated the in-hospital mortality among 
critically ill patients with hip fracture. This study aimed to develop and 
validate a model to estimate the risk of in-hospital mortality among critically 
ill patients with hip fracture.
METHODS: For this study, data from the Medical Information Mart for Intensive 
Care III (MIMIC-III) Database and electronic Intensive Care Unit (eICU) 
Collaborative Research Database were evaluated. Enrolled patients (n=391) in the 
MIMIC-III database were divided into a training (2/3, n=260) and a validation 
(1/3, n=131) group at random. Using machine learning algorithms such as random 
forest, gradient boosting machine, decision tree, and eXGBoosting machine 
approach, the training group was utilized to train and optimize models. The 
validation group was used to internally validate models and the optimal model 
could be obtained in terms of discrimination (area under the receiver operating 
characteristic curve, AUROC) and calibration (calibration curve). External 
validation was done in the eICU Collaborative Research Database (n=165). To 
encourage practical use of the model, a web-based calculator was developed 
according to the eXGBoosting machine approach.
RESULTS: The in-hospital death rate was 13.81% (54/391) in the MIMIC-III 
database and 10.91% (18/165) in the eICU Collaborative Research Database. Age, 
gender, anemia, mechanical ventilation, cardiac arrest, and chronic airway 
obstruction were the six model parameters which were identified using the Least 
Absolute Shrinkage and Selection Operator (LASSO) method combined with 10-fold 
cross-validation. The model established using the eXGBoosting machine approach 
showed the highest area under curve (AUC) value (0.797, 95% CI: 0.696-0.898) and 
the best calibrating ability, with a calibration slope of 0.999 and intercept of 
-0.019. External validation also revealed favorable discrimination (AUC: 0.715, 
95% CI: 0.566-0.864; accuracy: 0.788) and calibration (calibration slope: 0.805) 
in the eICU Collaborative Research Database. The web-based calculator could be 
available at https://doctorwangsj-webcalculator-main-yw69yd.streamlitapp.com/.
CONCLUSION: The model has the potential to be a pragmatic risk prediction tool 
that is able to identify hip fracture patients who are at a high risk of 
in-hospital mortality in ICU settings, guide patient risk counseling, and 
simplify prognosis bench-marking by controlling for baseline risk.

OBJECTIVES: Ischaemic stroke (IS) has become a major health problem globally as 
it is one of the leading causes of long-term disability and death. This study 
aimed to evaluate the association between red cell distribution width (RDW) to 
lymphocyte (LYM) ratio (RLR) and 30-day mortality risk in patients with IS.
METHODS: The present study employed a retrospectively cohort study design with 
the adult data extracted from the Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care 
(MIMIC-III, MIMIC-IV) databases between 2001 and 2019. The RLR was measured 
using RDW and LYM. Confounders were adjusted in Cox proportional hazards model. 
The outcome was 30-day mortality. Univariable and multivariable Cox proportional 
hazards models were establised. A further analysis was conducted on the basis of 
subgroup stratification by heart failure (HF) (yes or no), atrial fibrillation 
or flutter (yes or no), hypertension (yes or no), dyslipidemia (yes or no), 
sepsis (yes or no), and age (≥ 65 years and < 65 years).
RESULTS: In this study, 1,127 adult patients with IS were finally identified. 
Among them,818 patients survived (the survival group) and 309 patients died (the 
death group). The mean age was older in individuals from the death group than 
those from the survival group (70.19 years vs. 64.56 years). The elevated levels 
of RLR were linked to an increased risk of mortality within 30 days in patients 
with IS, with an HR of 1.70 (95% CI: 1.34-2.17). Subgroup analyses showed that 
high RLR levels was a significant risk factor for mortality at 30 days 
particularly in IS patients aged ≥ 65 years, HF, no atrial fibrillation or 
flutter, no hypertension, no dyslipidemia, and no sepsis.
CONCLUSION: Our study shows that high levels of RLR were associated with an 
increased risk of 30-day mortality in patients with IS, providing additional 
prognostic information for the treatment and supportive care of these patients.

BACKGROUND: As the average life expectancy increases, anesthesiologists confront 
unique challenges in the perioperative care of elderly patients who have 
significant comorbidities. In this study, we evaluated Elixhauser comorbidity 
measures-based risk factors associated with 30day mortality in patients aged 66 
years and older who underwent femur fracture surgery.
METHODS: We used the Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care III which 
contains the medical records of patients admitted to the intensive care unit 
(ICU) at Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center in the United States between 2001 
and 2012 to identify patients admitted to the ICU after femur fracture surgery 
(n=209). Patients who died within 30 days of admission (case group, n=49) were 
propensity score-matched to patients who did not (control group, n=98). The 
variables for matching were age, sex, race, anemia (hemoglobin ≤10 g/dl), and 
malignancy. We attempted to explain mortality via nine independent factors: 
hypertension, uncomplicated diabetes, complicated diabetes, congestive heart 
failure (CHF), cardiac arrhythmias, chronic pulmonary disease, renal failure, 
neurological disorders other than paralysis, and peripheral vascular disease.
RESULTS: Logistic regression identified three significant risk factors: CHF, 
arrhythmias, and neurological disorders other than paralysis. The odds ratio 
(OR) for the 30-day mortality of CHF was 4.99 (95% confidence interval [CI], 
2.18 to 12.06). The equivalent ORs for cardiac arrhythmias and neurological 
disorders other than paralysis were 2.61 (95% CI, 1.14 to 6.21) and 2.40 (95% 
CI, 0.95 to 6.48), respectively.
CONCLUSIONS: Identifying patients with these risk factors (CHF, arrhythmias, and 
neurological disorders other than paralysis) will assist clinicians with 
perioperative planning and provide caregivers with valuable information for 
decision-making.

Background: Acute myocardial infarction (AMI) is still the most serious 
manifestation of coronary artery disease. Systolic blood pressure (SBP) is the 
best predictor of blood pressure in AMI. Thus, its influence on AMI is necessary 
to be explored. Methods: A total of 4,277 patients with AMI were extracted from 
the Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care database. Chi-square test or 
Student's t-test was used to judge differences between groups, and Cox 
regression was used to identify factors that affect AMI prognosis. SBP was 
classified as low (<90 mmHg), normal (90-140 mmHg), or high (>140 mmHg), and a 
non-linear test was performed. Meaningful variables were incorporated into 
models for sensitivity analysis. Patient age was classified as low and high for 
subgroup analysis, and the cutoff value of the trajectory was identified. P < 
0.05 indicates statistical significance. Results: The effect of SBP on the 
prognosis of patients with AMI is non-linear. The risks in models 1-3 with low 
SBP are 6.717, 4.910, and 3.080 times those of the models with normal SBP, 
respectively. The risks in models 1-3 with high SBP are 1.483, 1.637, and 2.937 
times those of the models with normal SBP, respectively. The cutoff point (95% 
confidence interval) of the trajectory is 114.489 mmHg (111.275-117.702 mmHg, 
all P < 0.001). Conclusions: SBP has a non-linear effect on AMI prognosis. Low 
and high SBP show risks, and the risk of low SBP is obviously greater than that 
of high SBP.

BACKGROUND: To explore the potential heterogeneity of acute kidney injury (AKI) 
and evaluate the prognostic differences among AKI subphenotypes in critically 
ill patients with cardiovascular diseases.
METHODS: Data were extracted from the Medical Information Mart for Intensive 
Care (MIMIC)-III database. Latent class analysis (LCA) was used to explore the 
potential subphenotypes of AKI in critically ill patients with cardiovascular 
diseases. The number of classes was identified by the Bayesian information 
criterion and entropy. The differences in prognostic ability among the AKI 
subphenotypes were evaluated by logistic regression analysis.
RESULT: A total of 7738 AKI patients were enrolled in this study. Using LCA, AKI 
patients were divided into 4 heterogeneous subphenotypes, which were obviously 
different from the Kidney Disease: Improving Global Outcomes (KDIGO) stages. 
Interestingly, class 3 classified by LCA was dominated by stage 2, while the 
mortality rate in class 3 was significantly different from that in class 1 
(15.2% vs. 1.6%, p < 0.05). After further adjustment, the mortality rate in 
class 3 remained higher than that in class 1, with an odds ratio of 12.31 (95% 
confidence interval, 8.96-16.89).
CONCLUSIONS: LCA was feasible for AKI classification in critically ill patients 
with cardiovascular disease, and 4 distinct subphenotypes of AKI patients with 
different prognoses were identified. Our results highlighted the potential 
heterogeneity of AKI patients, which is worthy of further investigation.

BACKGROUND: The stress hyperglycemia ratio (SHR) has been established as a 
predictor of unfavorable outcomes across various diseases. However, its 
relationship with prognosis in patients with cardiogenic shock (CS) remains 
unclear. This study aims to investigate the association between SHR and outcomes 
in CS patients.
METHODS: A total of 904 CS patients with their first ICU admission were included 
in this study, utilizing data from the American Medical Information Mart for 
Intensive Care (MIMIC-IV) database. The primary endpoints were all-cause 
mortality at 30 days and 360 days. Patients were stratified into three groups 
based on the tertiles of the SHR.
RESULTS: The mean age of the cohort was 67.62 years, with 67.3% of participants 
being men. During the follow-up period, 221 patients (24.4%) died within 30 
days, and 360 patients (39.8%) died within 360 days. The 30-day all-cause 
mortality rates were 16.9%, 22.3%, and 34.2% in the T1, T2, and T3 groups, 
respectively (p < 0.001), while the 360-day all-cause mortality rates were 
34.9%, 39.0%, and 45.6%, respectively (p = 0.015). Compared with patients in T1, 
those in T3 exhibited a significantly higher risk of 30-day all-cause mortality 
(HR = 2.140, 95% CI: 1.522-3.008, p < 0.001) and 360-day all-cause mortality 
(HR = 1.495, 95% CI: 1.157-1.931, p = 0.002). Restricted cubic spline (RCS) 
analyses demonstrated an approximately linear relationship between SHR and 
360-day all-cause mortality (p for overall = 0.011; p for nonlinearity = 0.099). 
However, a nonlinear association was observed between SHR and 30-day all-cause 
mortality (p for overall < 0.001; p for nonlinearity = 0.030), with the risk 
increasing significantly when SHR exceeded 1.176. Subgroup analyses revealed 
that the effect of SHR was consistent across most subgroups except in patients 
with and without acute myocardial infarction (AMI). In patients with AMI, SHR 
was associated with a significantly elevated risk of mortality, whereas no 
significant association was observed in patients without AMI. For 30-day 
all-cause mortality, the HR was 1.059 (95% CI: 1.040-1.078) in patients with AMI 
and 1.002 (95% CI: 0.966-1.040) in those without AMI (p for 
interaction = 0.007). For 360-day all-cause mortality, the HR was 1.043 (95% CI: 
1.026-1.061) in patients with AMI and 0.984 (95% CI: 0.955-1.014) in those 
without AMI (p for interaction < 0.001).
CONCLUSION: Elevated SHR was significantly associated with increased 30-day and 
360-day all-cause mortality in patients with CS, particularly in those with CS 
complicated by AMI. SHR may serve as a valuable marker for risk stratification 
and guiding subsequent interventions in CS patients. However, further 
prospective studies are needed to confirm these findings.

BACKGROUND: The duration of hospitalization, especially in the intensive care 
unit (ICU), for patients with diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) is influenced by 
patient prognosis and treatment costs. Reducing ICU length of stay (LOS) in 
patients with DKA is crucial for optimising healthcare resources utilization. 
This study aimed to establish a nomogram prediction model to identify the risk 
factors influencing prolonged LOS in ICU-managed patients with DKA, which will 
serve as a basis for clinical treatment, healthcare safety, and quality 
management research.
METHODS: In this single-centre retrospective cohort study, we performed a 
retrospective analysis using relevant data extracted from the Medical 
Information Mart for Intensive Care IV (MIMIC-IV) database. Clinical data from 
669 patients with DKA requiring ICU treatment were included. Variables were 
selected using the Least Absolute Shrinkage and Selection Operator (LASSO) 
binary logistic regression model. Subsequently, the selected variables were 
subjected to a multifactorial logistic regression analysis to determine 
independent risk factors for prolonged ICU LOS in patients with DKA. A nomogram 
prediction model was constructed based on the identified predictors. The 
multivariate variables included in this nomogram prediction model were the 
Oxford acute severity of illness score (OASIS), Glasgow coma scale (GCS), acute 
kidney injury (AKI) stage, vasoactive agents, and myocardial infarction.
RESULTS: The prediction model had a high predictive efficacy, with an area under 
the curve value of 0.870 (95% confidence interval [CI], 0.831-0.908) in the 
training cohort and 0.858 (95% CI, 0.799-0.916) in the validation cohort. A 
highly accurate predictive model was depicted in both cohorts using the 
Hosmer-Lemeshow (H-L) test and calibration plots.
CONCLUSION: The nomogram prediction model proposed in this study has a high 
clinical application value for predicting prolonged ICU LOS in patients with 
DKA. This model can help clinicians identify patients with DKA at risk of 
prolonged ICU LOS, thereby enhancing prompt intervention and improving 
prognosis.

BACKGROUND: The incidence and mortality of cardiac arrest (CA) is high. We 
developed interpretable machine learning models for early prediction of ICU 
mortality risk in patients diagnosed with CA.
METHODS: Data from the Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care (MIMIC-IV, 
version 2.2) was randomized to training set (0.7) and internal validation set 
(0.3), and data from eICU(version 2.0.1) was used as external validation set. 
Five models including Logistic Regression (LR), Random Forest (RF), K Nearest 
Neighbor (KNN), Decision Tree (DT), and Extreme Gradient Boost (XGBoost) were 
developed. The model with the largest area under the Receiver Operating 
Characteristic (ROC) curve (AUC) and good performance in other features was 
defined as the best model, and Shapley Additive Explanations (SHAP) was used to 
improve the interpretability of the optimal model.
RESULTS: A total of 1088 patients from MIMIC-IV, and 3542 patients from eICU 
were included. Seven variables were selected to construct models by Least 
Absolute Shrinkage and Selection Operator (LASSO) regression. The RF model was 
the best predictive model with AUC and 95% CI at 0.83 (0.78-0.88) in internal 
validation set, and 0.71(0.68-0.74) in external validation set. SHAP analysis 
found that the variables that had a high impact on the risk of ICU death were 
minimal Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS), base excess, anion gap, and urine output.
CONCLUSION: RF is the optimal model for predicting the risk of ICU death in CA 
patients. The development of this model is important for early identification 
and intervention of CA patients who are at risk of dying in the ICU.

BACKGROUND: The role of the triglyceride-glucose (TyG) index in critically ill 
patients with congestive heart failure (CHF) and atrial fibrillation (AF), 
requiring intensive care unit (ICU) admission, remains unclear. This study aimed 
to investigate the association between the TyG index and the clinical prognosis 
of critically ill patients with CHF and AF.
METHODS: This retrospective observational cohort study utilized data from the 
Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care-IV (MIMIC IV2.2) database. 
Participants were categorized into four groups based on TyG index level. The 
primary outcome was hospital all-cause mortality. Multivariable logistic 
proportional regression analysis and restricted cubic spline regression were 
employed to assess the TyG index's association with hospital mortality in 
patients with CHF and AF. Sensitivity analysis included determining the TyG 
index's feature importance through subgroup analysis in different subgroups.
RESULTS: A total of 787 patients were included in the study, with hospital and 
ICU mortalities of 14.2% and 8.3%, respectively. Multivariate logistic 
regression analysis demonstrated that the TyG index was independently associated 
with an increased risk of hospital mortality (odds ratio (OR), 1.59 [95% 
confidence interval (CI) 1.15-2.19], P = 0.005) and ICU mortality [OR 1.9; (95% 
CI 1.28-2.83), P = 0.001] after adjusting for confounders. The restricted cubic 
spline regression model indicated a linear increase in the risks of in-hospital 
and ICU mortality with a higher TyG index. Sensitivity analysis revealed 
consistent effect sizes and directions in different subgroups, ensuring result 
stability.
CONCLUSIONS: The results of our study suggest a significant association between 
the TyG index and hospital and ICU all-cause mortality in critically ill 
patients with CHF and AF. This finding implies that the TyG index could 
potentially serve as a valuable tool for identifying patients with CHF and AF at 
an elevated risk of all-cause mortality.

In critically ill patients with acute myocardial infarction (AMI), the 
relationship between the early administration of β-blockers and the risks of 
in-hospital and long-term mortality remains controversial. Furthermore, there 
are conflicting evidences for the efficacy of the early administration of 
intravenous followed by oral β-blockers in AMI. We conducted a retrospective 
analysis of critically ill patients with AMI who received the early 
administration of β-blockers within 24 hours of admission. The data were 
extracted from the Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care IV database. We 
enrolled 2467 critically ill patients with AMI in the study, with 1355 patients 
who received the early administration of β-blockers and 1112 patients who were 
non-users. Kaplan-Meier survival analysis and Cox proportional hazards models 
showed that the early administration of β-blockers was associated with a lower 
risk of in-hospital mortality (adjusted hazard ratio [aHR] 0.52; 95% confidence 
interval [95%CI] 0.42-0.64), 1-year mortality (aHR 0.54, 95%CI 0.47-0.63), and 
5-year mortality (aHR 0.60, 95%CI 0.52-0.69). Furthermore, the early 
administration of both oral β-blockers and intravenous β-blockers followed by 
oral β-blockers may reduce the mortality risk, compared with non-users. The 
risks of in-hospital and long-term mortality were significantly decreased in 
patients who underwent revascularization with the early administration of 
β-blockers. We found that the early administration of β-blockers could lower the 
risks of in-hospital and long-term mortality. Furthermore, the early 
administration of both oral β-blockers and intravenous β-blockers followed by 
oral β-blockers may reduce the mortality risk, compared with non-users. Notably, 
patients who underwent revascularization with the early administration of 
β-blockers showed the lowest risks of in-hospital and long-term mortality.

BACKGROUND: Anion gap (AG) has been proved to be associated with prognosis of 
many cardiovascular diseases. This study is aimed at exploring the association 
of AG with inhospital all-cause mortality and adverse clinical outcomes in 
coronary care unit (CCU) patients.
METHOD: All data of this study was extracted from Medical Information Mart for 
Intensive Care III (MIMIC-III, version 1.4) database. All patients were divided 
into four groups according to AG quartiles. Primary outcome was inhospital 
all-cause mortality. Lowess smoothing curve was drawn to describe the overall 
trend of inhospital mortality. Binary logistic regression analysis was performed 
to determine the independent effect of AG on inhospital mortality.
RESULT: A total of 3593 patients were enrolled in this study. In unadjusted 
model, as AG quartiles increased, inhospital mortality increased significantly, 
OR increased stepwise from quartile 2 (OR, 95% CI: 1.01, 0.74-1.38, P = 0.958) 
to quartile 4 (OR, 95% CI: 2.72, 2.08-3.55, P < 0.001). After adjusting for 
possible confounding variables, this association was attenuated, but still 
remained statistically significant (quartile 1 vs. quartile 4: OR, 95% CI: 1.02, 
0.72-1.45 vs. 1.49, 1.07-2.09, P = 0.019). Moreover, CCU mortality (P < 0.001) 
and rate of acute kidney injury (P < 0.001) were proved to be higher in the 
highest AG quartiles. Length of CCU (P < 0.001) and hospital stay (P < 0.001) 
prolonged significantly in higher AG quartiles. Maximum sequential organ failure 
assessment score (SOFA) (P < 0.001) and simplified acute physiology score II 
(SAPSII) (P < 0.001) increased significantly as AG quartiles increased. Moderate 
predictive ability of AG on inhospital (AUC: 0.6291), CCU mortality (AUC: 
0.6355), and acute kidney injury (AUC: 0.6096) was confirmed. The interactions 
were proved to be significant in hypercholesterolemia, congestive heart failure, 
chronic lung disease, respiratory failure, oral anticoagulants, Beta-blocks, 
angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor (ACEI)/angiotensin receptor blocker 
(ARB), and vasopressin treatment subgroups.
CONCLUSION: AG was an independent risk factor of inhospital all-cause mortality 
and was associated with adverse clinical outcomes in CCU patients.

XGBoost in the Prediction of 28-Day Mortality in Critical Elderly Patients with 
Hip Fracture: A MIMIC-IV Cohort Study.

Yuan W, Xiao M, Wang R, Liu G, Wu J, Wang X.

BACKGROUND: The impact of hip fracture on older adults is significant, including 
increased mortality, reduced activity levels and abilities and reduced quality 
of life。 Hip fractures often occur in the elderly and increase the risk of 
death. The purpose of this study is to analyze the risk factors associated with 
28-day mortality in elderly patients with severe hip fractures using two models, 
XG Boost and multivariate logistic regression, and to compare the predictive 
value of the two models.
METHODS: MIMIC database is a powerful tool to provide clinical data to clinical 
researchers. The database was established in 2003 with funding from the National 
Institutes of Health by the Computational Physiology Laboratory at the 
Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center 
(BIDMC) at Harvard Medical School, and Philips Medical. Patients with severe hip 
fractures in the elderly were included based on the MIMIC-IV database and were 
divided into a death group and a survival group based on the death 28 days after 
admission to the ICU. Baseline data differences between the two groups of 
patients were compared, and risk factors associated with 28-day mortality in 
severe elderly patients with hip fractures were analyzed using XG Boost and 
multivariate logistic regression models, respectively. The predictive power of 
the two models was compared using receiver operation characteristics curves.
RESULTS: 287 elderly patients with severe hip fractures were included, including 
43 cases (15.0%) in the death group and 244 cases (85.0%) in the survival group. 
Logistic regression analysis showed that advanced age, male, congestive heart 
failure (CHF), chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), high sepsis-related 
organ failure (SOFA) score, high heart rate, high white blood cell count, high 
creatinine, high mean arterial pressure, and high hemoglobin levels were 
associated with 28-day mortality after admission to the ICU, while the higher 
the mean arterial pressure and the hemoglobin level, the lower the risk of 
death. Although the rate of using mechanical ventilation and receiving blood 
transfusion in the death group was higher than that in the survival group, 
neither of them reached statistical significance. The XG Boost model shows that 
the top 5 factors associated with 28-day mortality are Sequential organ failure 
score (SOFA) score (31 points), chronic heart failure (20 points), chronic 
structural pulmonary disease (18 points), age (17 points), and male (15 points). 
The higher the mean arterial pressure and the hemoglobin level, the lower the 
risk of death. The area under the ROC curve predicted by the multivariate 
logistic regression model for mortality risk was 0.729 (95% CI: 0.701-0.783), 
and the Jordan index was 0.412. The area under the ROC curve predicted by the XG 
Boost model for mortality risk was 0.804 (95% CI: 0.720-0.837), and the Jordan 
index was 0.492.
CONCLUSION: The ability of the XG Boost model to predict the 28-day mortality 
risk in elderly patients with severe hip fractures is better than the 
multivariate logistic regression model, which will help healthcare professionals 
provide more support for elderly patients with hip fracture.

BACKGROUND: Recent research has revealed the potential value of machine learning 
(ML) models in improving prognostic prediction for patients with trauma. ML can 
enhance predictions and identify which factors contribute the most to 
posttraumatic mortality. However, no studies have explored the risk factors, 
complications, and risk prediction of preoperative and postoperative traumatic 
coagulopathy (PPTIC) in patients with trauma.
OBJECTIVE: This study aims to help clinicians implement timely and appropriate 
interventions to reduce the incidence of PPTIC and related complications, 
thereby lowering in-hospital mortality and disability rates for patients with 
trauma.
METHODS: We analyzed data from 13,235 patients with trauma from 4 medical 
centers, including medical histories, laboratory results, and hospitalization 
complications. We developed 10 ML models in Python (Python Software Foundation) 
to predict PPTIC based on preoperative indicators. Data from 10,023 Medical 
Information Mart for Intensive Care patients were divided into training (70%) 
and test (30%) sets, with 3212 patients from 3 other centers used for external 
validation. Model performance was assessed with 5-fold cross-validation, 
bootstrapping, Brier score, and Shapley additive explanation values.
RESULTS: Univariate logistic regression identified PPTIC risk factors as (1) 
prolonged activated partial thromboplastin time, prothrombin time, and 
international normalized ratio; (2) decreased levels of hemoglobin, hematocrit, 
red blood cells, calcium, and sodium; (3) lower admission diastolic blood 
pressure; (4) elevated alanine aminotransferase and aspartate aminotransferase 
levels; (5) admission heart rate; and (6) emergency surgery and perioperative 
transfusion. Multivariate logistic regression revealed that patients with PPTIC 
faced significantly higher risks of sepsis (1.75-fold), heart failure 
(1.5-fold), delirium (3.08-fold), abnormal coagulation (3.57-fold), tracheostomy 
(2.76-fold), mortality (2.19-fold), and urinary tract infection (1.95-fold), 
along with longer hospital and intensive care unit stays. Random forest was the 
most effective ML model for predicting PPTIC, achieving an area under the 
receiver operating characteristic of 0.91, an area under the 
precision-recall curve of 0.89, accuracy of 0.84, sensitivity of 0.80, 
specificity of 0.88, precision of 0.88, F1-score of 0.84, and Brier score of 
0.13 in external validation.
CONCLUSIONS: Key PPTIC risk factors include (1) prolonged activated partial 
thromboplastin time, prothrombin time, and international normalized ratio; (2) 
low levels of hemoglobin, hematocrit, red blood cells, calcium, and sodium; (3) 
low diastolic blood pressure; (4) elevated alanine aminotransferase and 
aspartate aminotransferase levels; (5) admission heart rate; and (6) the need 
for emergency surgery and transfusion. PPTIC is associated with severe 
complications and extended hospital stays. Among the ML models, the random 
forest model was the most effective predictor.

BACKGROUND: Patients with atrial fibrillation (AF) suffer a higher risk of 
death, and it is necessary to develop prediction tools for mortality risk in 
critically ill patients with AF. This study aimed to develop a novel predictive 
nomogram of in-hospital mortality after 48 h in the coronary care unit (CCU) for 
patients with AF.
METHODS: We collected information on CCU patients with AF from the "Medical 
Information Mart for Intensive Care-III" database and developed a nomogram model 
for predicting the all-cause mortality risk after 48 h in the hospital. Key 
variables were selected by univariate logistic and least absolute shrinkage and 
selection operator regression. The independent predictors with p < 0.05 were 
screened out by multivariate logistic regression. A predictive nomogram was 
constructed using these independent predictors, and the model calibration and 
discrimination were evaluated.
RESULTS: This study finally enrolled 1248 CCU patients with AF, and the 
in-hospital mortality was 17% (209/1248). The predictive nomogram was 
constructed by 13 selected independent predictors, including age, smoking 
status, acute kidney injury, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, ventricular 
arrhythmia, shock, urea, red cell distribution width, leucocytosis, continuous 
renal replacement therapy, continuous positive airway pressure, anticoagulation, 
and heart rate. The area under the curve of the nomogram was 0.803 (95% 
confidence interval 0.771-0.835). The nomogram was verified to have good 
accuracy and calibration.
CONCLUSIONS: This study developed a novel nomogram containing age, acute kidney 
injury, and heart rate that can be a good predictor of potential in-hospital 
mortality after 48 h in CCU patients with AF.

OBJECTIVE: Heart failure (HF) is a chronic progressive syndrome caused by a 
variety of cardiovascular diseases and is associated with high morbidity, 
mortality, and healthcare burden. Forecasting the prognosis of HF patients at an 
early stage is important. Therefore, our objective was to explore the 
relationship between HF patients' prognosis and the albumin-bilirubin (ALBI) 
grade.
METHODS: Data for the study were obtained from the MIMIC database. Patients with 
ALBI grade 1 were matched to patients with ALBI grades 2 and 3 using propensity 
score matching (PSM). Post-matching analyses were performed using Cox 
proportional hazards models, Kaplan-Meier survival analysis, restricted cubic 
splines (RCS), and subgroup analyses.
RESULTS: RCS analyses revealed a nonlinear relationship between ALBI grade and 
30-, 90-, and 360-day mortality in patients with HF, with a threshold value 
identified at -1.92. When ALBI scores were below - 1.92, the risk of mortality 
in HF patients remained relatively stable. In contrast, as ALBI scores 
approached and exceeded - 1.92, the mortality risk increased rapidly. Before 
PSM, both ALBI grades 2 and 3 were independent predictors of mortality in 
patients with HF; however, after PSM, ALBI grade 2 was not statistically 
associated with patient mortality. This result was supported by Kaplan-Meier 
(K-M) analysis.

Long-Term Outcomes in Older Patients with Sepsis in the ICU: A Retrospective 
Study.

Xu C, Lv L, Hu W, Yu Z, Qian H, Chen F.

OBJECTIVE: The primary objectives of this study were to compare the 
characteristics of older and younger patients with sepsis and to analyze risk 
factors associated with 28-day and 90-day mortality in critically ill patients. 
Our study aimed to explore whether there are significant differences between 
sepsis patients in different age groups and whether these differences are 
related to the association between disease severity and mortality.
METHODS: We conducted a single-center, retrospective study of 5783 critically 
ill patients over 18 years of age from the Medical Information Mart for 
Intensive Care III database diagnosed with sepsis and admitted to the intensive 
care unit between 2008 and 2012. We performed a retrospective analysis, selected 
the Critical Care Medicine Information Mart III database, and collected data on 
patients with sepsis. We then collated and analyzed these data to compare 
differences in characteristics between older and younger patients and identify 
associated risk factors, which can help understand patient mortality. This 
approach leverages existing clinical data and avoids new experiments or data 
collection. Kaplan-Meier survival curve was used to assess 28-day and 90-day 
mortality, and a Cox proportional hazards regression model was used to evaluate 
the associated risk factors with 28-day and 90-day mortality.
RESULTS: Our study identified significant differences in mortality between older 
and younger patients with sepsis, finding that older patients had significantly 
higher mortality than younger patients. Furthermore, we successfully identified 
risk factors associated with mortality, results that have important implications 
for optimizing patient care and making clinical decisions. Of 5783 patients with 
sepsis, 2044 (35.3%) were younger than 60 years, and 3739 (64.7%) were aged 60 
years or older. The 28-day mortality rate was 11.8% and 21.2% in the younger and 
older cohorts, respectively (P < .01). In the age-stratified analysis, the 
28-day mortality was the highest in patients aged over 80 years (14.6% vs. 21.2% 
vs. 26.8%, P < .001). Factors associated with 28-day and 90-day mortality in 
patients with sepsis included age, weight, the need for mechanical ventilation, 
congestive heart failure, chronic pulmonary disease, malignancy, and Sequential 
Organ Failure Assessment score. Higher mortality in older patients with sepsis 
suggests the need for more aggressive treatment and monitoring. We also 
identified risk factors associated with mortality, helping to develop 
individualized treatment strategies. In addition, the different clinical 
characteristics of patients in different age groups emphasize the need for 
refined care pathways to meet their special needs. These results will help 
improve the treatment effect and quality of life of patients with sepsis.
CONCLUSIONS: Our study fills the knowledge gap on the manifestations of sepsis 
patients in different age groups and helps medical staff better predict and 
manage disease progression in these two groups and provide personalized 
treatment. This lays the foundation for future in-depth research on age-related 
sepsis factors and is expected to improve patient survival and recovery rates. 
Older patients with sepsis had higher mortality rates and adverse outcomes. The 
mortality rate in patients with sepsis gradually increased with age. The 
importance of these findings is that they can help guide patient care and 
clinical decision-making, particularly when dealing with older and younger 
patients with sepsis, to improve treatment outcomes and reduce mortality. We 
would like to acknowledge that there are several limitations to the study, 
including the selectivity of the database and the retrospective nature, which 
preclude inference of causal relationships. In addition, some unconsidered 
variables may affect the results, and missing information in the data may also 
have an impact on the study. Future research could further explore these 
issues.This study highlights the critical role of age in sepsis patient outcomes 
and provides a strong basis for more sophisticated care and treatment. Our 
findings will help save more lives and improve patients' chances of recovery, 
which has profound implications for future research and clinical practice in the 
field of sepsis.

Atrial Fibrillation Detection in ICU Patients: A Pilot Study on MIMIC III 
Data().

Bashar SK, Ding E, Albuquerque D, Winter M, Binici S, Walkey AJ, McManus DD, 
Chon KH.

Atrial fibrillation (AF) is the most prevalent arrhythmia, resulting in varying 
and irregular heartbeats. AF increases risk for numerous cardiovascular diseases 
including stroke, heart failure and as a result, computer aided efficient 
monitoring of AF is crucial, especially for intensive care unit (ICU) patients. 
In this paper, we present an automated and robust algorithm to detect AF from 
ICU patients using electrocardiogram (ECG) signals. Several statistical 
parameters including root mean square of successive differences, Shannon 
entropy, Sample entropy and turning point ratio are calculated from the heart 
rate. A subset of the Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care (MIMIC) III 
database containing 36 subjects is used in this study. We compare the AF 
detection performance of several classifiers for both the training and blinded 
test data. Using the support vector machine classifier with radial basis kernel, 
the proposed method achieves 99.95% cross-validation accuracy on the training 
data and 99.88% sensitivity, 99.65% specificity and 99.75% accuracy on the 
blinded test data.

BACKGROUND: Heart failure (HF) is a primary public health issue associated with 
a high mortality rate. However, effective treatments still need to be developed. 
The optimal level of glycemic control in non-diabetic critically ill patients 
suffering from HF is uncertain. Therefore, this study examined the relationship 
between initial glucose levels and in-hospital mortality in critically ill 
non-diabetic patients with HF.
METHODS: A total of 1159 critically ill patients with HF were selected from the 
Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care-III (MIMIC-III) data resource and 
included in this study. The association between initial glucose levels and 
hospital mortality in seriously ill non-diabetic patients with HF was analyzed 
using smooth curve fittings and multivariable Cox regression. Stratified 
analyses were performed for age, gender, hypertension, atrial fibrillation, CHD 
with no MI (coronary heart disease with no myocardial infarction), renal 
failure, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), estimated glomerular 
filtration rate (eGFR), and blood glucose concentrations.
RESULTS: The hospital mortality was identified as 14.9%. A multivariate Cox 
regression model, along with smooth curve fitting data, showed that the initial 
blood glucose demonstrated a U-shape relationship with hospitalized deaths in 
non-diabetic critically ill patients with HF. The turning point on the left side 
of the inflection point was HR 0.69, 95% CI 0.47-1.02, p = 0.068, and on the 
right side, HR 1.24, 95% CI 1.07-1.43, p = 0.003. Significant interactions 
existed for blood glucose concentrations (7-11 mmol/L) (p-value for interaction: 
0.009). No other significant interactions were detected.
CONCLUSIONS: This study demonstrated a U-shape correlation between initial blood 
glucose and hospital mortality in critically ill non-diabetic patients with HF. 
The optimal level of initial blood glucose for non-diabetic critically ill 
patients with HF was around 7 mmol/L.

BACKGROUND: Predicting the prognosis of patients with acute myocardial 
infarction (AMI) combined with diabetes mellitus (DM) is crucial due to high 
in-hospital mortality rates. This study aims to develop and validate a mortality 
risk prediction model for these patients by interpretable machine learning (ML) 
methods.
METHODS: Data were sourced from the Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care 
IV (MIMIC-IV, version 2.2). Predictors were selected by Least absolute shrinkage 
and selection operator (LASSO) regression and checked for multicollinearity with 
Spearman's correlation. Patients were randomly assigned to training and 
validation sets in an 8:2 ratio. Seven ML algorithms were used to construct 
models in the training set. Model performance was evaluated in the validation 
set using metrics such as area under the curve (AUC) with 95% confidence 
interval (CI), calibration curves, precision, recall, F1 score, accuracy, 
negative predictive value (NPV), and positive predictive value (PPV). The 
significance of differences in predictive performance among models was assessed 
utilising the permutation test, and 10-fold cross-validation further validated 
the model's performance. SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) and Local 
Interpretable Model-agnostic Explanations (LIME) were applied to interpret the 
models.
RESULTS: The study included 2,828 patients with AMI combined with DM. Nineteen 
predictors were identified through LASSO regression and Spearman's correlation. 
The Random Forest (RF) model was demonstrated the best performance, with an AUC 
of 0.823 (95% CI: 0.774-0.872), high precision (0.867), accuracy (0.873), and 
PPV (0.867). The RF model showed significant differences (p < 0.05) compared to 
the K-Nearest Neighbours and Decision Tree models. Calibration curves indicated 
that the RF model's predicted risk aligned well with actual outcomes. 10-fold 
cross-validation confirmed the superior performance of RF model, with an average 
AUC of 0.828 (95% CI: 0.800-0.842). Significant Variables in RF model indicated 
that the top eight significant predictors were urine output, maximum anion gap, 
maximum urea nitrogen, age, minimum pH, maximum international normalised ratio 
(INR), mean respiratory rate, and mean systolic blood pressure.
CONCLUSION: This study demonstrates the potential of ML methods, particularly 
the RF model, in predicting in-hospital mortality risk for AMI patients with DM. 
The SHAP and LIME methods enhance the interpretability of ML models.

BACKGROUND: The ratio of red blood cell distribution width (RDW) to albumin 
(ALB), known as RAR, functions as an innovative indicator related to prognosis. 
However, whether RAR can predict the in-hospital mortality (IHM) for heart 
failure (HF) patients remains ambiguous.
METHODS: This study included HF patients derived from the Medical Information 
Mart for Intensive Care III (MIMIC-III) and IV (MIMIC-IV) databases. To examine 
the association between RAR and IHM, multiple Logistic regression models were 
conducted, complemented by subgroup analyses. Additionally, to ascertain the 
optimal threshold for RAR, restricted cubic spline (RCS) regressions were 
applied.
RESULTS: In the MIMIC-III (n = 9,413) and MIMIC-IV (n = 18,685) HF cohorts, the 
incidence of IHM was observed in 1,639 (17.41%) and 1,175 (6.29%) participants. 
Following adjustment for various covariates, RAR was shown to correlate with IHM 
(OR, 1.45 [95% CI, 1.08-1.39]). The areas under the curves for RAR were 0.683 
(MIMIC-III) and 0.710 (MIMIC-IV), indicating superior predictive value than RDW 
and ALB. In subgroup analysis, younger HF patients with diabetes and without 
atrial fibrillation or anaemia showed higher ORs than older patients without 
diabetes or atrial fibrillation and those with anaemia, respectively. RCS 
indicated the OR for RAR was non-linear with IHM, and the optimal threshold for 
RAR prediction was between 4.5 and 5.
CONCLUSION: An elevated RAR correlates with an increased risk of IHM in HF 
patients. Given that RAR can be readily derived from routine laboratory tests, 
it holds potential as a novel biomarker for identifying high-risk HF patients.

BACKGROUND: Recent studies showed histamine H2 receptor antagonists (H2RAs) 
exposure was associated with reduced mortality in heart failure (HF) patients. 
However, specific HF patients who are sensitive to H2RAs exposure or not are yet 
to be further defined.
AIM: This study aimed to identify HF patient characteristics that may benefit 
from H2RAs exposure.
METHOD: Neural network-based variational autoencoders and Gaussian Mixture Model 
(GMM) clustering methods were employed to classify the critically ill patients 
with HF exposed to H2RAs based on Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care 
III and IV databases. Binary logistic and multivariable Cox regression analysis 
based on propensity score matching (PSM) were employed to estimate the 
association between H2RAs exposure of each cluster and all-cause mortality of 
included patients.
RESULTS: A total of 9,585 H2RAs users among 23,855 included HF patients were 
identified into four clusters according to GMM clustering: cluster 1 (combined 
with acute kidney failure, septic shock, and pneumonia), cluster 2 (combined 
with atrial fibrillation), cluster 3 (combined with coronary artery disease 
(CAD) and/or had higher urine output), and cluster 4 (co-administered with 
calcium-antagonists). The cluster 3 patients were significantly associated with 
reduced all-cause mortality compared with non-H2RAs users after PSM, which were 
further validated in 14,280 HF patients from the large multi-center electronic 
intensive care unit Collaborative Research Database (eICU-CRD).
CONCLUSION: Histamine H2 receptor antagonist exposure was more sensitive in HF 
patients who were combined with CAD. Furthermore, male HF patients or those with 
higher urine output were also sensitive to H2RAs exposure.

BACKGROUND: Acute myocardial infarction (AMI) has a significant impact on global 
health, especially among individuals with diabetes, emphasizing the need for 
specialized glycemic management. This study examines the glycemic comparison 
index (GCI), a novel prognostic tool designed for patients with AMI and 
diabetes, aiming to enhance glucose management in critical care settings.
METHODS: This retrospective cohort analysis used data from the Medical 
Information Mart for Intensive Care IV database (version 2.2). The GCI was 
calculated by comparing mean blood glucose levels in the intensive care unit 
(ICU) to baseline glucose levels. Patients were stratified into tertiles based 
on their GCI scores. The primary outcome measured was one-year all-cause 
mortality, while secondary outcomes included hospital mortality, ICU-free days, 
and hypoglycemic events. Statistical analyses included time-dependent receiver 
operating characteristic (ROC), cox proportional hazards models, generalized 
linear models (GLM), and restricted cubic spline analysis.
RESULTS: The patient population comprised 622 individuals, with a mean age of 
69.9 years and 64.6% male representation. The high GCI group exhibited the 
highest one-year mortality rate and fewer ICU-free days, while the low GCI group 
exhibited a higher incidence of hypoglycemia. Statistical analyses revealed that 
GCI was a significant predictor of one-year all-cause mortality (hazard ratio: 
2.21, 95% confidence interval: 1.51-3.24). Analysis using time-dependent ROC 
confirmed the consistent predictive accuracy of GCI for survival at 1, 6, and 
12 months (area under the curve: 0.671, 0.670, and 0.634, respectively). 
Furthermore, GLM analysis indicated that a higher GCI was associated with fewer 
ICU-free days.
CONCLUSIONS: Higher GCI values are associated with increased one-year mortality 
and fewer ICU-free days in patients with AMI and diabetes. In comparison, lower 
GCI values are correlated with a higher risk of hypoglycemia. The GCI 
demonstrates potential as a personalized prognostic tool, although further 
validation is needed.

BACKGROUND: Extracorporeal circulation auxiliary to open cardiac surgery 
(ECAOCS) is one of the most complex surgical procedures and carries a very high 
risk of death. We developed a nomogram from a retrospective study to predict the 
risk of death during patient hospitalization.
METHODS: All clinical data were extracted from the Medical Information Mart for 
Intensive Care IV (MIMIC-IV) database. We extracted clinical variables for the 
first 24 hours after admission to the intensive care unit (ICU) in a total of 
880 patients who underwent ECAOCS. All patients were randomly divided into 
training and validation cohort in a ratio of 7:3. All variables included in the 
study were subjected to univariate logistic regression analysis. In order to 
prevent overfitting and to address the problem of severe covariance, all factors 
with P<0.05 in the univariate logistic regression analysis were analyzed using 
the least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) regression. A 
multivariate logistic regression model was developed based on the factors output 
from the LASSO regression and a nomogram was plotted. The receiver operating 
characteristic (ROC) curve was constructed and the area under the curve (AUC) 
was calculated in training and validation cohort. Finally, the evaluation of the 
model was performed by calibration curves and Hosmer-Lemeshow goodness-of-fit 
test (HL test) and decision curve analysis (DCA) was performed.
RESULTS: Indicators included in the nomogram were anion gap (AG), central venous 
pressure (CVP), glucose, creatinine (Cr), prothrombin time (PT), activated 
partial thromboplastin time (APTT), bicarbonate ion (HCO3 -), cerebrovascular 
disease (CVD), peripheral vascular disease (PVD), and acute myocardial 
infarction (AMI).
CONCLUSIONS: Our study developed a model for predicting postoperative hospital 
mortality in patients underwent ECAOCS by incorporating AG, CVP, glucose, Cr, 
APTT, HCO3 -, CVD, AMI, and PVD from the first 24 hours after admission to the 
ICU.

OBJECTIVE: To explore the optimal pulse oxygen saturation (SpO2) range during 
hospitalization for patients with sepsis.
METHODS: A case-control study design was employed. Demographic information, 
vital signs, comorbidities, laboratory parameters, critical illness scores, 
clinical treatment information, and clinical outcomes of sepsis patients were 
extracted from the Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care- IV (MIMIC- IV). 
A generalized additive model (GAM) combined with a Loess smoothing function was 
employed to analyze and visualize the nonlinear relationship between SpO2 levels 
during hospitalization and in-hospital all-cause mortality. The optimal range of 
SpO2 was determined, and Logistic regression model along with Kaplan-Meier curve 
were utilized to validate the association between the determined range of SpO2 
and in-hospital all-cause mortality.
RESULTS: A total of 5 937 patients met the inclusion criteria, among whom 1 191 
(20.1%) died during hospitalization. GAM analysis revealed a nonlinear and 
U-shaped relationship between SpO2 levels and in-hospital all-cause mortality 
among sepsis patients during hospitalization. Multivariable Logistic regression 
analysis further confirmed that patients with SpO2 levels between 0.96 and 0.98 
during hospitalization had a decreased mortality compared to those with SpO2 < 
0.96 [hypoxia group; odds ratio (OR) = 2.659, 95% confidence interval (95%CI) 
was 2.190-3.229, P < 0.001] and SpO2 > 0.98 (hyperoxia group; OR = 1.594, 95%CI 
was 1.337-1.900, P < 0.001). Kaplan-Meier survival curve showed that patients 
with SpO2 between 0.96 and 0.98 during hospitalization had a higher probability 
of survival than those patient with SpO2 < 0.96 and SpO2 > 0.98 (Log-Rank test: 
χ 2 = 113.400, P < 0.001). Sensitivity analyses demonstrated that, with the 
exception of subgroups with smaller sample sizes, across the strata of age, 
gender, body mass index (BMI), admission type, race, heart rate, systolic blood 
pressure, diastolic blood pressure, mean arterial pressure, respiratory rate, 
body temperature, myocardial infarction, congestive heart failure, 
cerebrovascular disease, chronic liver disease, diabetes mellitus, sequential 
organ failure assessment (SOFA), simplified acute physiology score II (SAPS II), 
systemic inflammatory response syndrome score (SIRS), and Glasgow coma score 
(GCS), the mortality of patients with SpO2 between 0.96 and 0.98 was 
significantly lower than those of patients with SpO2 < 0.96 and SpO2 > 0.98.
CONCLUSIONS: During hospitalization, the level of SpO2 among sepsis patients 
exhibits a U-shaped relationship with in-hospital all-cause mortality, 
indicating that heightened and diminished oxygen levels are both associated with 
increased mortality risk. The optimal SpO2 range is determined to be between 
0.96 and 0.98.

Red cell distribution width (RDW) and glycated hemoglobin index (HGI) is 
considered an important tool for assessing the prognosis of sepsis patients, 
closely related to the risk of mortality associated with sepsis. This study 
investigates the association between the HGI combined with RDW and the risk of 
in-hospital mortality in patients with sepsis. We analyzed data from 13,726 
sepsis patients who were admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) for more than 
24 h, sourced from the American Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care 
(MIMIC-IV) database. Kaplan-Meier survival curves and multivariable Cox 
regression analyses were employed to assess the impact of various variables on 
patient outcomes, stratified by quartiles of HGI and RDW. Additionally, 
restricted cubic spline (RCS) analysis was utilized to explore how changes in 
HGI and RDW might influence the studied outcomes. The results indicated that the 
highest quartile (Q4) of the combined metrics significantly increased 
in-hospital mortality compared to the lowest quartile (Q1) (p < 0.0001). 
Multivariable Cox regression analysis revealed that patients in Q4 faced the 
highest risk of in-hospital mortality (hazard ratio: 1.22, 95% confidence 
interval: [1.10-1.36], p < 0.001). RCS analysis demonstrated a nonlinear 
relationship between HGI-RDW and the risk of adverse outcomes. Further analysis 
identified significantly elevated risks in patients over 65 years old, those who 
were widowed, those receiving macrolide antibiotics, and those with congestive 
heart failure or severe liver disease. In conclusion, elevated levels of the 
combined HGI and RDW metrics are independent risk factors for adverse outcomes 
in critically ill patients with sepsis, associated with increased mortality.

OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to investigate the potential correlation between the 
neutrophil percentage to serum albumin ratio(NPAR) and in-hospital mortality in 
critically ill patients with Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD).
PATIENTS AND METHODS: This study employed a retrospective cohort design. A total 
of 599 COPD patients were included in this research. Clinical data from the 
MIMIC-IV (Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care IV) database were 
utilized. To determine whether a correlation exists between NPAR and in-hospital 
mortality, a multivariable logistic regression analysis was conducted. Subgroup 
analyses were performed, taking into account factors such as age, sex, diabetes, 
congestive heart failure, and ventilator use.
RESULTS: Among the 599 patients studied, 114 (19.0%) experienced in-hospital 
mortality. In the multivariable logistic regression model, NPAR was positively 
correlated with in-hospital mortality; for each unit increase in NPAR, the 
in-hospital mortality rate increased by 5% (Odds Ratio [OR] = 1.05; 95% 
Confidence Interval [95% CI] = 1.02-1.09). Compared to the lowest NPAR group, 
the highest NPAR group had a significantly greater risk of in-hospital mortality 
(OR [95% CI] = 2.15 [1.11-4.17]). Furthermore, the results of the subgroup 
analyses were consistent across all groups.
CONCLUSION: Our study reveals a correlation between NPAR levels and mortality in 
COPD patients. Further research is warranted to validate these findings.

BACKGROUND: Respiratory rate (RR) is one important vital sign that is often 
neglected in patients with acute myocardial infarction (AMI). The present study 
aimed to evaluate the impact of admission RR on the prognosis in patients with 
AMI.
METHODS: This study included 5631 AMI patients from Medical Information Mart for 
Intensive Care IV (MIMIC-IV) and 1323 patients from The First Affiliated 
Hospital of Chongqing Medical University (validation cohort). The primary 
endpoint was 30-day all-cause mortality. Patients were divided into increased RR 
group (RR > 20 breaths/min) and normal RR group (RR ≤ 20 breaths/min) based on 
admission RR.
RESULTS: In the MIMIC-IV cohort, the median age was 70 years and 3503 (62.2%) 
patients were male. Compared to patients with normal RR, patients with admission 
RR > 20 breaths/min had significantly increased risk of 30-day all-cause 
mortality (14.2% vs. 27.5%, p < 0.001). After multivariate adjustment, admission 
RR > 20 breaths/min was independently associated with increased risk of 30-day 
all-cause mortality (HR 1.715; 95%CI 1.507-1.952, p < 0.001). The findings from 
MIMIC-IV were validated in the data from The First Affiliated Hospital of 
Chongqing Medical University and the results were consistent.
CONCLUSION: RR is not only a vital sign but also a simple and practical 
indicator for predicting the prognosis of patients with AMI. Increased RR upon 
admission independently predicted a higher risk of poor outcomes, making it a 
valuable tool for early risk stratification and guiding timely interventions.

Consider that inflammatory factors are associated with short-term mortality in 
patients with acute myocardial infarction (AMI). In this retrospective analysis 
of 2,784 AMI patients from the Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care-IV 
database, we evaluated the impact of inflammatory markers on in-hospital 
mortality and predicted 30-day and 90-day outcomes. Patients were divided into 
groups based on in-hospital survival (n = 2,364) and mortality (n = 420). 
Analysis of initial hospital admission laboratory data, including inflammatory 
factors, revealed these factors as independent predictors of in-hospital 
mortality (Q4 of RDW: OR 1.96, NLR: OR 1.63, SII: OR 1.85, and SIRI: OR 2.23, 
all P < 0.05). Cox proportional hazards models confirmed their significance for 
predicting 30-day (Q4 of NLR: OR 1.83, SII: OR 1.86, and SIRI: OR 2.01, all P < 
0.05) and 90-day mortality (Q4 of RDW: OR 1.46, NLR: OR 1.69, SII: OR 1.73, and 
SIRI: OR 1.72, all P < 0.05). Increasing levels of inflammatory markers 
correlated with higher odds and hazard ratios, as illustrated by Restricted 
Cubic Spline curves. Kaplan-Meier survival analysis showed better survival rates 
with lower inflammatory marker levels. Receiver operating characteristic curves 
demonstrated good predictive performance of individual inflammatory factors, 
with a new composite marker showing the highest predictive ability (AUC = 
0.720). This study underscores the association of inflammatory factors with both 
hospital and short-term mortality in AMI patients.

BACKGROUND: The use, timing, and dosage of morphine in septic patients with a 
history of Chronic Heart Failure (CHF) are poorly studied, and it is still 
unclear if morphine administration affects sepsis survival. This study aims to 
elucidate the relationship between early morphine administration and 30-day 
mortality among septic patients with a history of CHF.
METHODS: Utilizing data from the Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care IV 
(MIMIC-IV) database, this retrospective cohort study focuses on septic patients 
with CHF. The authors investigated the effects of early morphine administration 
(within 24 h of ICU admission) on 30-day mortality, employing Cox proportional 
hazards modeling and Propensity Score Matching (PSM) for analysis.
RESULTS: The authors analyzed 7424 adult septic patients with CHF, among whom 
6495 received early morphine and 929 were managed without morphine. The early 
morphine group exhibited a significantly lower 30-day mortality rate compared to 
the nonmorphine group (post-matched 16.4 % vs. 25.7 %, Absolute Risk Reduction 
(ARR) 9.3 % (95 % Confidence Interval [95 % CI 5.1-13.6], p < 0.001). Among 
septic patients with CHF, early morphine administration was associated with a 
reduction in 30-day death in all adjusted variables (HR = 0.539‒0.735, p < 
0.001). After PSM, only <15 mg of morphine was correlated to a lower 30-day 
mortality rate (HR = 0.233, 95 % CI 0.086-0.632, p < 0.001).
CONCLUSION: This investigation reveals a significant association between the 
early administration of morphine and reduced risk-adjusted 30-day mortality in 
septic patients with CHF.

OBJECTIVES: Heart failure, especially in the elderly, is a growing global issue. 
This research explores the safety of human albumin infusion in treating heart 
failure patients with hypoalbuminemia, despite limited clinical data on its use 
with diuretic therapy.
METHODS: Data were collected from the Medical Information Mart for Intensive 
Care III (MIMIC-III) database, which included a cohort of 6094 patients 
diagnosed with heart failure. Propensity score matching, logistic regression, 
Kaplan-Meier curves, and Locally Weighted Scatterplot Smoothing (LOWESS) curves 
were used to examine how albumin administration correlates with different 
clinical results. The evaluated results comprised in-hospital mortality, 
cumulative fluid output over 24 hours, Length of Stay in the Intensive Care Unit 
(ICU LOS), and overall hospitalization duration (hospital LOS).
RESULTS: Infusing albumin was found to be markedly linked with higher 
in-hospital mortality among heart failure patients whose serum albumin levels 
were ≤ 2.9 g/dL (p < 0.001). However, no statistically significant correlation 
was found between the patients with levels > 2.9 g/dL (p = 0.62). Following 
propensity score matching in the ≤ 2.9 g/dL serum albumin group, albumin 
infusion was linked to prolonged hospital and ICU stays (p = 0.002, p < 0.001), 
but showed no significant association with total 24 hour fluid output and 90-day 
survival (p = 0.173, p = 0.656).
CONCLUSION: The use of albumin has been linked to increased risk-adjusted 
mortality during hospitalization, as well as prolonged stays in both hospital 
and ICU settings for patients with heart failure and low levels of serum 
albumin. Physicians should exercise caution when considering the administration 
of albumin in these cases.
