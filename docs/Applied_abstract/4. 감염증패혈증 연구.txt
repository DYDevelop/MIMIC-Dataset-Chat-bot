BACKGROUND: This study aimed to explore the association between the 
triglyceride-glucose (TyG) index and the risk of in-hospital mortality in 
critically ill patients with sepsis.
METHODS: This was a retrospective observational cohort study and data were 
obtained from the Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care-IV (MIMIC IV2.2) 
database. The participants were grouped into three groups according to the TyG 
index tertiles. The primary outcome was in-hospital all-cause mortality. 
Multivariable logistics proportional regression analysis and restricted cubic 
spline regression was used to evaluate the association between the TyG index and 
in-hospital mortality in patients with sepsis. In sensitivity analysis, the 
feature importance of the TyG index was initially determined using machine 
learning algorithms and subgroup analysis based on different subgroups was also 
performed.
RESULTS: 1,257 patients (56.88% men) were included in the study. The 
in-hospital, 28-day and intensive care unit (ICU) mortality were 21.40%, 26.17%, 
and 15.43% respectively. Multivariate logistics regression analysis showed that 
the TyG index was independently associated with an elevated risk of in-hospital 
mortality (OR 1.440 [95% CI 1.106-1.875]; P = 0.00673), 28-day mortality (OR 
1.391; [95% CI 1.52-1.678]; P = 0.01414) and ICU mortality (OR 1.597; [95% CI 
1.188-2.147]; P = 0.00266). The restricted cubic spline regression model 
revealed that the risks of in-hospital, 28-day, and ICU mortality increased 
linearly with increasing TyG index. Sensitivity analysis indicate that the 
effect size and direction in different subgroups are consistent, the results is 
stability. Additionally, the machine learning results suggest that TyG index is 
an important feature for the outcomes of sepsis.
CONCLUSION: Our study indicates that a high TyG index is associated with an 
increased in-hospital mortality in critically ill sepsis patients. Larger 
prospective studies are required to confirm these findings.

BACKGROUND: Acute kidney injury (AKI) is the most common and serious 
complication of sepsis, accompanied by high mortality and disease burden. The 
early prediction of AKI is critical for timely intervention and ultimately 
improves prognosis. This study aims to establish and validate predictive models 
based on novel machine learning (ML) algorithms for AKI in critically ill 
patients with sepsis.
METHODS: Data of patients with sepsis were extracted from the Medical 
Information Mart for Intensive Care III (MIMIC- III) database. Feature selection 
was performed using a Boruta algorithm. ML algorithms such as logistic 
regression (LR), k-nearest neighbors (KNN), support vector machine (SVM), 
decision tree, random forest, Extreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost), and 
artificial neural network (ANN) were applied for model construction by utilizing 
tenfold cross-validation. The performances of these models were assessed in 
terms of discrimination, calibration, and clinical application. Moreover, the 
discrimination of ML-based models was compared with those of Sequential Organ 
Failure Assessment (SOFA) and the customized Simplified Acute Physiology Score 
(SAPS) II model.
RESULTS: A total of 3176 critically ill patients with sepsis were included for 
analysis, of which 2397 cases (75.5%) developed AKI during hospitalization. A 
total of 36 variables were selected for model construction. The models of LR, 
KNN, SVM, decision tree, random forest, ANN, XGBoost, SOFA and SAPS II score 
were established and obtained area under the receiver operating characteristic 
curves of 0.7365, 0.6637, 0.7353, 0.7492, 0.7787, 0.7547, 0.821, 0.6457 and 
0.7015, respectively. The XGBoost model had the best predictive performance in 
terms of discrimination, calibration, and clinical application among all models.
CONCLUSION: The ML models can be reliable tools for predicting AKI in septic 
patients. The XGBoost model has the best predictive performance, which can be 
used to assist clinicians in identifying high-risk patients and implementing 
early interventions to reduce mortality.

BACKGROUND: Acute kidney injury (AKI) is a common complication in critically ill 
patients with sepsis and is often associated with a poor prognosis. We aimed to 
construct and validate an interpretable prognostic prediction model for patients 
with sepsis-associated AKI (S-AKI) using machine learning (ML) methods.
METHODS: Data on the training cohort were collected from the Medical Information 
Mart for Intensive Care IV database version 2.2 to build the model, and data of 
patients were extracted from Hangzhou First People's Hospital Affiliated to 
Zhejiang University School of Medicine for external validation of model. 
Predictors of mortality were identified using Recursive Feature Elimination 
(RFE). Then, random forest, extreme gradient boosting (XGBoost), multilayer 
perceptron classifier, support vector classifier, and logistic regression were 
used to establish a prognosis prediction model for 7, 14, and 28 days after 
intensive care unit (ICU) admission, respectively. Prediction performance was 
assessed using the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve and decision 
curve analysis (DCA). SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) were used to 
interpret the ML models.
RESULTS: In total, 2599 patients with S-AKI were included in the analysis. Forty 
variables were selected for the model development. According to the areas under 
the ROC curve (AUC) and DCA results for the training cohort, XGBoost model 
exhibited excellent performance with F1 Score of 0.847, 0.715, 0.765 and AUC 
(95% CI) of 0.91 (0.90, 0.92), 0.78 (0.76, 0.80), and 0.83 (0.81, 0.85) in 
7 days, 14 days and 28 days group, respectively. It also demonstrated excellent 
discrimination in the external validation cohort. Its AUC (95% CI) was 0.81 
(0.79, 0.83), 0.75 (0.73, 0.77), 0.79 (0.77, 0.81) in 7 days, 14 days and 
28 days group, respectively. SHAP-based summary plot and force plot were used to 
interpret the XGBoost model globally and locally.
CONCLUSIONS: ML is a reliable tool for predicting the prognosis of patients with 
S-AKI. SHAP methods were used to explain intrinsic information of the XGBoost 
model, which may prove clinically useful and help clinicians tailor precise 
management.

BACKGROUND: Sepsis is a leading cause of mortality in intensive care units and 
vasoactive drugs are widely used in septic patients. The cardiovascular response 
of septic shock patients during resuscitation therapies and the relationship of 
the cardiovascular response and clinical outcome has not been clearly described.
METHODS: We included adult patients admitted to the ICU with sepsis from Peking 
Union Medical College Hospital (internal), Medical Information Mart for 
Intensive Care IV (MIMIC-IV) and eICU Collaborative Research Database 
(eICU-CRD). The Blood Pressure Response Index (BPRI) was defined as the ratio 
between the mean arterial pressure and the vasoactive-inotropic score. BRRI was 
compared with existing risk scores on predicting in-hospital death. The 
relationship between BPRI and in-hospital mortality was calculated. A XGBoost's 
machine learning model identified the features that influence short-term changes 
in BPRI.
FINDINGS: There were 2139, 9455, and 4202 patients in the internal, MIMIC-IV and 
eICU-CRD cohorts, respectively. BPRI had a better AUROC for predicting 
in-hospital mortality than SOFA (0.78 vs. 0.73, p = 0.01) and APS (0.78 vs. 
0.74, p = 0.03) in the internal cohort. The estimated odds ratio for death per 
unit decrease in BPRI was 1.32 (95% CI 1.20-1.45) when BPRI was below 7.1 vs. 
0.99 (95% CI 0.97-1.01) when BPRI was above 7.1 in the internal cohort; similar 
relationships were found in MIMIC-IV and eICU-CRD. Respiratory support and 
latest cumulative 12-h fluid balance were intervention-related features 
influencing BPRI.
INTERPRETATION: BPRI is an easy, rapid, precise indicator of the response of 
patients with septic shock to vasoactive drugs. It is a comparable and even 
better predictor of prognosis than SOFA and APS in sepsis and it is simpler and 
more convenient in use. The application of BPRI could help clinicians identify 
potentially at-risk patients and provide clues for treatment.

PURPOSE: Compliance to the Surviving Sepsis Campaign (SSC) guidelines is 
limited. This is known to be associated with increased mortality. The aim of 
this retrospective cohort study was to identify among the SCC guidelines the 
optimal bundle of recommendations that minimize 28-day mortality.
METHODS: We used a training cohort to identify, using a least absolute shrinkage 
and selection operator penalized machine learning model, this bundle. Patients 
with sepsis/septic shock admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) were 
extracted from two US databases, the Medical Information Mart for Intensive 
Care-IV (MIMIC-IV) database (training and internal validation cohorts) and the 
eICU Collaborative Research Database (eICU-CRD) (external validation cohort). In 
the validation cohorts, we defined a bundle group that includes patients who 
were treated with at least all the recommendations selected in our bundle and a 
no-bundle group that includes patients in whom at least one recommendation from 
our bundle was omitted.
RESULTS: All-cause 28-day mortality was the primary outcome measure. A total of 
42,735 patients were included. Six recommendations (antimicrobials, balanced 
crystalloid, insulin therapy, corticosteroids, vasopressin, and bicarbonate 
therapy) were identified from the training cohort to be included in our bundle. 
In the propensity score-(PS)-matched internal validation cohort, the bundle 
group was associated with a lower mortality (OR 0.41 [0.33-0.53]; p < 0.001) 
compared to the no-bundle group. This was confirmed in the PS-matched external 
validation cohort (OR 0.75 [0.60-0.94]; p 0.02).
CONCLUSION: Our bundle of six recommendations is associated with a dramatic 
reduction in mortality in sepsis and septic shock. This bundle needs to be 
evaluated prospectively.

BACKGROUND: New-onset atrial fibrillation (NOAF) is the most common arrhythmia 
in critically ill patients admitted to intensive care and is associated with 
poor prognosis and disease burden. Identifying high-risk individuals early is 
crucial. This study aims to create and validate a NOAF prediction model for 
critically ill patients using machine learning (ML).
METHODS: The data came from two non-overlapping datasets from the Medical 
Information Mart for Intensive Care (MIMIC), with MIMIC-IV used for training and 
subset of MIMIC-III used as external validation. LASSO regression was used for 
feature selection. Eight ML algorithms were employed to construct the prediction 
model. Model performance was evaluated based on identification, calibration, and 
clinical application. The SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) method was used 
for visualizing model characteristics and individual case predictions.
RESULTS: Among 16,528 MIMIC-IV patients, 1520 (9.2%) developed AF post-ICU 
admission. A model with 23 variables was built, with XGBoost performing best, 
achieving an AUC of 0.891 (0.873-0.888) in validation and 0.769 (0.756-0.782) in 
external validation. Key predictors included age, mechanical ventilation, urine 
output, sepsis, blood urea nitrogen, percutaneous arterial oxygen saturation, 
continuous renal replacement therapy and weight. A risk probability greater than 
0.6 was defined as high risk. A friendly user interface had been developed for 
clinician use.
CONCLUSION: We developed a ML model to predict the risk of NOAF in critically 
ill patients without cardiac surgery and validated its potential as a clinically 
reliable tool. SHAP improves the interpretability of the model, enables 
clinicians to better understand the causes of NOAF, helps clinicians to prevent 
it in advance and improves patient outcomes.

Intensive care unit (ICU)-acquired infection is a common cause of poor prognosis 
of sepsis in the ICU. However, sepsis-associated ICU-acquired infections have 
not been fully characterized. The study aims to assess the risk factors and 
develop a model that predicts the risk of ICU-acquired infections in patients 
with sepsis.
METHODS: We retrieved data from the Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care 
(MIMIC) IV database. Patients were randomly divided into training and validation 
cohorts at a 7:3 ratio. A multivariable logistic regression model was used to 
identify independent risk factors that could predict ICU-acquired infection. We 
also assessed its discrimination and calibration abilities and compared them 
with classical score systems.
RESULTS: Of 16,808 included septic patients, 2,871 (17.1%) developed 
ICU-acquired infection. These patients with ICU-acquired infection had a 17.7% 
ICU mortality and 31.8% in-hospital mortality and showed a continued rise in 
mortality from 28 to 100 days after ICU admission. The classical Systemic 
Inflammatory Response Syndrome Score (SIRS), Sequential Organ Failure Assessment 
(SOFA), Oxford Acute Severity of Illness Score (OASIS), Simplified Acute 
Physiology Score II (SAPS II), Logistic Organ Dysfunction Score (LODS), Charlson 
Comorbidity Index (CCI), and Acute Physiology Score III (APS III) scores were 
associated with ICU-acquired infection, and cerebrovascular insufficiency, 
Gram-negative bacteria, surgical ICU, tracheostomy, central venous catheter, 
urinary catheter, mechanical ventilation, red blood cell (RBC) transfusion, LODS 
score and anticoagulant therapy were independent predictors of developing 
ICU-acquired infection in septic patients. The nomogram on the basis of these 
independent predictors showed good calibration and discrimination in both the 
derivation (AUROC = 0.737; 95% CI, 0.725-0.749) and validation (AUROC = 0.751; 
95% CI, 0.734-0.769) populations and was superior to that of SIRS, SOFA, OASIS, 
SAPS II, LODS, CCI, and APS III models.
CONCLUSIONS: ICU-acquired infections increase the likelihood of septic 
mortality. The individualized prognostic model on the basis of the nomogram 
could accurately predict ICU-acquired infection and optimize management or 
tailored therapy.

BACKGROUND: Albumin infusion is the primary therapeutic strategy for septic 
patients with liver cirrhosis. Although recent studies have investigated the 
efficacy of albumin in the resuscitation stage of septic patients with liver 
cirrhosis, it remains unclear whether daily albumin administration can improve 
outcomes. Furthermore, the indications for initiating albumin therapy are not 
well defined.
METHODS: Septic patients with liver cirrhosis were obtained from the Medical 
Information Mart for Intensive Care (MIMIC-IV 2.0) database. Marginal structural 
Cox models were employed to investigate the association between daily albumin 
infusion and 28-day mortality. We also aimed to explore under what circumstances 
enrolled patients could benefit most from albumin administration, based on the 
clinical parameters collected on the day of albumin infusion, including serum 
albumin concentration, serum lactate concentration, mean arterial pressure 
(MAP), and vasopressor dosage.
RESULTS: A total of 2265 patients were included in the final analysis, of whom 
1093 (48.3%) had received albumin treatment at least once. The overall 28-day 
mortality was 29.6%. After marginal structural modeling, daily albumin infusion 
was associated with a reduced risk of 28-day death (hazard ratio, 0.76; 95% CI 
0.61-0.94). We found that patients benefit most from albumin infusion when 
initiated on the day of serum albumin concentration between 2.5 and 3.0 g/dL, 
serum lactate concentration greater than or equal to 2 mmol/L, MAP less than 
60 mmHg, or vasopressor dosage between 0.2 and 0.3 mcg/kg/min (norepinephrine 
equivalent, NEE).
CONCLUSIONS: Albumin infusion is associated with a reduction in mortality in 
septic patients with liver cirrhosis under specific circumstances. Serum albumin 
concentration, serum lactate, MAP, and vasopressor dosage were found to be 
modifiers of treatment effectiveness and should be considered when deciding to 
initial albumin infusion.

BACKGROUND: This study aimed to construct predictive models for the risk of 
sepsis in patients with Acute pancreatitis (AP) using machine learning methods 
and compared optimal one with the logistic regression (LR) model and scoring 
systems.
METHODS: In this retrospective cohort study, data were collected from the 
Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care III (MIMIC III) database between 
2001 and 2012 and the MIMIC IV database between 2008 and 2019. Patients were 
randomly divided into training and test sets (8:2). The least absolute shrinkage 
and selection operator (LASSO) regression plus 5-fold cross-validation were used 
to screen and confirm the predictive factors. Based on the selected predictive 
factors, 6 machine learning models were constructed, including support vector 
machine (SVM), K-nearest neighbour (KNN), multi-layer perceptron (MLP), LR, 
gradient boosting decision tree (GBDT) and adaptive enhancement algorithm 
(AdaBoost). The models and scoring systems were evaluated and compared using 
sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value (PPV), negative predictive 
value (NPV), accuracy, and the area under the curve (AUC).
RESULTS: A total of 1, 672 patients were eligible for participation. In the 
training set, 261 AP patients (19.51%) were diagnosed with sepsis. The 
predictive factors for the risk of sepsis in AP patients included age, 
insurance, vasopressors, mechanical ventilation, Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS), heart 
rate, respiratory rate, temperature, SpO2, platelet, red blood cell distribution 
width (RDW), International Normalized Ratio (INR), and blood urea nitrogen 
(BUN). The AUC of the GBDT model for sepsis prediction in the AP patients in the 
testing set was 0.985. The GBDT model showed better performance in sepsis 
prediction than the LR, systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS) score, 
bedside index for severity in acute pancreatitis (BISAP) score, sequential organ 
failure assessment (SOFA) score, quick-SOFA (qSOFA), and simplified acute 
physiology score II (SAPS II).
CONCLUSION: The present findings suggest that compared to the classical LR model 
and SOFA, qSOFA, SAPS II, SIRS, and BISAP scores, the machine learning 
model-GBDT model had a better performance in predicting sepsis in the AP 
patients, which is a useful tool for early identification of high-risk patients 
and timely clinical interventions.

BACKGROUND: There was considerable debate regarding the effect of mean blood 
glucose (MBG) and glycemic variability (GV) on the mortality of septic patients. 
This retrospective cohort study aimed to assess the association between MBG and 
GV with ICU mortality of sepsis patients and to explore the optimal MBG range.
METHODS: Sepsis patients were enrolled from the Medical Information Mart for 
Intensive Care IV database (MIMIC-IV). MBG and glycemic coefficient of variation 
(GluCV) were, respectively, calculated to represent the overall glycemic status 
and GV during ICU stay. The associations between MBG, GluCV, and ICU mortality 
of the septic patients were assessed by using multivariate logistic regression 
in different subgroups and the severity of sepsis. Restricted cubic splines 
evaluated the optimal MBG target.
RESULTS: A total of 7,104 adult sepsis patients were included. The multivariate 
logistic regression results showed that increased MBG and GluCV were 
significantly correlated with ICU mortality. The adjusted odds ratios were 1.14 
(95% CI 1.09-1.20) and 1.05 (95% CI 1.00-1.12). However, there was no 
association between hyperglycemia and ICU mortality among diabetes, liver 
disease, immunosuppression, and hypoglycemia patients. And the impact of high 
GluCV on ICU mortality was not observed in those with diabetes, 
immunosuppression, liver disease, and non-septic shock. The ICU mortality risk 
of severe hyperglycemia (≧200 mg/dl) and high GluCV (>31.429%), respectively, 
elevated 2.30, 3.15, 3.06, and 2.37, 2.79, 3.14-folds in mild (SOFA ≦ 3), middle 
(SOFA 3-7), and severe group (SOFA ≧ 7). The MBG level was associated with the 
lowest risk of ICU mortality and hypoglycemia between 120 and 140 mg/dl in the 
subgroup without diabetes. For the diabetic subset, the incidence of 
hypoglycemia was significantly reduced when the MBG was 140-190 mg/dl, but a 
glycemic control target effectively reducing ICU mortality was not observed.
CONCLUSION: MBG and GluCV during the ICU stay were associated with all-cause ICU 
mortality in sepsis patients; however, their harms are not apparent in some 
particular subgroups. The impact of hyperglycemia and high GV on death increased 
with the severity of sepsis. The risk of ICU mortality and hypoglycemia in those 
with no pre-existing diabetes was lower when maintaining the MBG in the range of 
120-140 mg/dl.

BACKGROUND: The lymphocyte-to-high-density lipoprotein (HDL) ratio (LHR) is 
associated with both inflammation and immunity, and may have the potential to 
predict the prognosis of sepsis. Our study aimed to evaluate the relationship 
between LHR and sepsis-related mortality.
METHODS: We collected data from the Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care 
IV (MIMIC-IV, version 2.2) database by targeting patients who met the Sepsis-3 
criteria and recorded the absolute values of lymphocytes and HDL after 
admission. We then used restricted cubic splines based on logistic regression to 
simulate the relationship between the LHR and 90-day mortality. Subsequently, 
the hazardous threshold was derived based on the mortality curve, and further 
evaluations were performed using different methods and data sources for 
hazardous threshold.
RESULTS: We ultimately included 1027 eligible patients from the MIMIC-IV 
database and described the nonlinear relationship between LHR and 90-day 
mortality. Based on the curve, an LHR of ≤ 0.6 indicated harmful threshold, and 
the odds ratio for mortality was 1.74 (P=0.001). The outperforming hazard was 
particularly marked in patients with chronic lung disease and remained 
consistent after adjusting for baseline data and validating multiple data 
sources.
CONCLUSIONS: The LHR has prognostic value in patients with sepsis, and an LHR ≤ 
0.6 is a deleterious load that increases mortality.

Septic patients in the intensive care unit (ICU) often develop sepsis-associated 
delirium (SAD), which is strongly associated with poor prognosis. The aim of 
this study is to develop a machine learning-based model for the early prediction 
of SAD. Patient data were extracted from the Medical Information Mart for 
Intensive Care IV (MIMIC-IV) database and the eICU Collaborative Research 
Database (eICU-CRD). The MIMIC-IV data were divided into a training set and an 
internal validation set, while the eICU-CRD data served as an external 
validation set. Feature variables were selected using least absolute shrinkage 
and selection operator regression, and prediction models were built using 
logistic regression, support vector machines, decision trees, random forests, 
extreme gradient boosting (XGBoost), k-nearest neighbors and naive Bayes 
methods. The performance of the models was evaluated in the validation set. The 
model was also applied to a group of patients who were not assessed or could not 
be assessed for delirium. The MIMIC-IV and eICU-CRD databases included 14,620 
and 1723 patients, respectively, with a median time to diagnosis of SAD of 24 
and 30 h. Compared with Non-SAD patients, SAD patients had higher 28-days ICU 
mortality rates and longer ICU stays. Among the models compared, the XGBoost 
model had the best performance and was selected as the final model (internal 
validation area under the receiver operating characteristic curves 
(AUROC) = 0.793, external validation AUROC = 0.701). The XGBoost model 
outperformed other models in predicting SAD. The establishment of this 
predictive model allows for earlier prediction of SAD compared to traditional 
delirium assessments and is applicable to patients who are difficult to assess 
with traditional methods.

BACKGROUND: The risk of death in sepsis patients with acute respiratory distress 
syndrome (ARDS) was as high as 20-50%. Few studies focused on the risk 
identification of ARDS among sepsis patients. This study aimed to develop and 
validate a nomogram to predict the ARDS risk in sepsis patients based on the 
Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care IV database.
METHODS: A total of 16,523 sepsis patients were included and randomly divided 
into the training and testing sets with a ratio of 7:3 in this retrospective 
cohort study. The outcomes were defined as the occurrence of ARDS for ICU 
patients with sepsis. Univariate and multivariate logistic regression analyses 
were used in the training set to identify the factors that were associated with 
ARDS risk, which were adopted to establish the nomogram. The receiver operating 
characteristic and calibration curves were used to assess the predictive 
performance of nomogram.
RESULTS: Totally 2422 (20.66%) sepsis patients occurred ARDS, with the median 
follow-up time of 8.47 (5.20, 16.20) days. The results found that body mass 
index, respiratory rate, urine output, partial pressure of carbon dioxide, blood 
urea nitrogen, vasopressin, continuous renal replacement therapy, ventilation 
status, chronic pulmonary disease, malignant cancer, liver disease, septic shock 
and pancreatitis might be predictors. The area under the curve of developed 
model were 0.811 (95% CI 0.802-0.820) in the training set and 0.812 (95% CI 
0.798-0.826) in the testing set. The calibration curve showed a good concordance 
between the predicted and observed ARDS among sepsis patients.
CONCLUSION: We developed a model incorporating thirteen clinical features to 
predict the ARDS risk in patients with sepsis. The model showed a good 
predictive ability by internal validation.

BACKGROUND: Inflammation and stress response may be related to the occurrence of 
sepsis-associated acute kidney injury (SA-AKI) in patients with sepsis.Insulin 
resistance (IR) is closely related to the stress response, inflammatory 
response, immune response and severity of critical diseases. We assume that the 
triglyceride-glucose (TyG) index, an alternative indicator for IR, is associated 
with the occurrence of SA-AKI in patients with sepsis.
METHODS: Data were obtained from The Medical Information Mart for Intensive 
Care-IV(MIMIC-IV) database in this retrospective cohort study. Univariate and 
multivariate logistic regression analysis and multivariate restricted cubic 
spline(RCS) regression were conducted to evaluate the association between TyG 
index and SA-AKI, length of stay (LOS). Subgroup and sensitivity analyses were 
performed to verify the robustness of the results.
RESULTS: The study ultimately included data from 1426 patients with sepsis, 
predominantly of white ethnicity (59.2%) and male sex (56.4%), with an SA-AKI 
incidence rate of 78.5%. A significant linear association was observed between 
the TyG index and SA-AKI (OR, 1.40; 95% confidence interval(CI) [1.14-1.73]). 
Additionally, the TyG index demonstrated a significant correlation with the 
length of stay (LOS) in both the hospital (β, 1.79; 95% CI [0.80-2.77]) and the 
intensive care unit (ICU) (β, 1.30; 95% CI [0.80-1.79]). Subgroup and 
sensitivity analyses confirmed the robustness of these associations.
CONCLUSION: This study revealed a strong association between the TyG index and 
both SA-AKI and length of stay in patients with sepsis. These findings suggest 
that the TyG index is a potential predictor of SA-AKI and the length of 
hospitalization in sepsis cases, broadening its application in this context. 
However, further research is required to confirm whether interventions targeting 
the TyG index can genuinely enhance the clinical outcomes of patients with 
sepsis.

OBJECTIVE: To construct a nomogram based on the Sequential Organ Failure 
Assessment (SOFA) that is more accurate in predicting 30-, 60-, and 90-day 
mortality risk in patients with sepsis.
METHODS: Data from patients with sepsis were retrospectively collected from the 
Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care (MIMIC) database. Included patients 
were randomly divided into training and validation cohorts. Variables were 
selected using a backward stepwise selection method with Cox regression, then 
used to construct a prognostic nomogram. The nomogram was compared with the SOFA 
model using the concordance index (C-index), area under the time-dependent 
receiver operating characteristics curve (AUC), net reclassification improvement 
(NRI), integrated discrimination improvement (IDI), calibration plotting, and 
decision-curve analysis (DCA).
RESULTS: A total of 5240 patients were included in the study. Patient's age, 
SOFA score, metastatic cancer, SpO2, lactate, body temperature, albumin, and red 
blood cell distribution width were included in the nomogram. The C-index, AUC, 
NRI, IDI, and DCA of the nomogram showed that it performs better than the SOFA 
alone.
CONCLUSION: A nomogram was established that performed better than the SOFA in 
predicting 30-, 60-, and 90-day mortality risk in patients with sepsis.

OBJECTIVES: Sepsis is among the leading causes of morbidity, mortality, and cost 
overruns in critically ill patients. Early intervention with antibiotics 
improves survival in septic patients. However, no clinically validated system 
exists for real-time prediction of sepsis onset. We aimed to develop and 
validate an Artificial Intelligence Sepsis Expert algorithm for early prediction 
of sepsis.
DESIGN: Observational cohort study.

PATIENTS: Over 31,000 admissions to the ICUs at two Emory University hospitals 
(development cohort), in addition to over 52,000 ICU patients from the publicly 
available Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care-III ICU database 
(validation cohort). Patients who met the Third International Consensus 
Definitions for Sepsis (Sepsis-3) prior to or within 4 hours of their ICU 
admission were excluded, resulting in roughly 27,000 and 42,000 patients within 
our development and validation cohorts, respectively.
INTERVENTIONS: None.
MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: High-resolution vital signs time series and 
electronic medical record data were extracted. A set of 65 features (variables) 
were calculated on hourly basis and passed to the Artificial Intelligence Sepsis 
Expert algorithm to predict onset of sepsis in the proceeding T hours (where T = 
12, 8, 6, or 4). Artificial Intelligence Sepsis Expert was used to predict onset 
of sepsis in the proceeding T hours and to produce a list of the most 
significant contributing factors. For the 12-, 8-, 6-, and 4-hour ahead 
prediction of sepsis, Artificial Intelligence Sepsis Expert achieved area under 
the receiver operating characteristic in the range of 0.83-0.85. Performance of 
the Artificial Intelligence Sepsis Expert on the development and validation 
cohorts was indistinguishable.
CONCLUSIONS: Using data available in the ICU in real-time, Artificial 
Intelligence Sepsis Expert can accurately predict the onset of sepsis in an ICU 
patient 4-12 hours prior to clinical recognition. A prospective study is 
necessary to determine the clinical utility of the proposed sepsis prediction 
model.

BACKGROUND: vasopressin is commonly used as a second-line vasopressor for 
patients with septic shock, but the optimal timing of initiation is uncertain. 
This study was designed to investigate when vasopressin initiation may be 
beneficial for 28-day mortality in septic shock patients.
METHODS: This was a retrospective observational cohort study from the MIMIC-III 
v1.4 and MIMIC-IV v2.0 databases. All adults diagnosed with septic shock 
according to Sepsis-3 criteria were included. Patients were stratified into two 
groups based on norepinephrine (NE) dose at the time of vasopressin initiation, 
defined as the low doses of NE group (NE<0.25 µg/kg/min) and the high doses of 
NE group (NE ≥ 0.25 µg/kg/min). The primary end-point was 28-day mortality after 
diagnosis of septic shock. The analysis involved propensity score matching 
(PSM), multivariable logistic regression, doubly robust estimation, the gradient 
boosted model, and an inverse probability-weighting model.
RESULTS: A total of 1817 eligible patients were included in our original cohort 
(613 in the low doses of NE group and 1204 in the high doses of NE group). After 
1:1 PSM, 535 patients from each group with no difference in disease severity 
were included in the analysis. The results showed that vasopressin initiation at 
low doses of NE was associated with reduced 28-day mortality (odds ratio [OR] 
0.660, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.518-0.840, p < 0.001). Compared with 
patients in the high doses of NE group, patients in the low doses of NE group 
received significantly shorter duration of NE, with less intravenous fluid 
volume on the first day after initiation of vasopressin, more urine on the 
second day, and longer mechanical ventilation-free days and CRRT-free days. 
Nevertheless, there were no significant differences in hemodynamic response to 
vasopressin, duration of vasopressin, and ICU or hospital length of stay.
CONCLUSIONS: Among adults with septic shock, vasopressin initiation when 
low-dose NE was used was associated with an improvement in 28-day mortality.

STUDY OBJECTIVE: To investigate the association between dexmedetomidine 
administration and outcomes in critically ill patients with sepsis-associated 
acute kidney injury (SA-AKI).
DESIGN: A single-center, retrospective, cohort study.
SETTING: Intensive care unit (ICU).
PATIENTS: A total of 2192 critically ill patients with SA-AKI were included in 
the analysis, which identified from the Medical Information Mart for Intensive 
Care (MIMIC-IV) database between 2008 and 2019.
INTERVENTIONS: Intravenous infusion of dexmedetomidine.
MEASUREMENTS: The primary outcome was recovery of renal function. In-hospital 
mortality, vasopressor requirements, length of ICU and hospital stay were 
considered secondary outcomes. The Cox proportional hazards, logistic 
regression, and linear regression models were used to assess the association 
between dexmedetomidine and outcomes. Propensity score matching (PSM) analysis 
was used to match patients receiving dexmedetomidine to those without treatment.
MAIN RESULTS: After PSM, 719 matched patient pairs were derived from patients 
who received dexmedetomidine and those who did not. The administration of 
dexmedetomidine was associated with a higher rate of renal recovery [61.8% vs. 
55.8%, hazard ratio (HR) 1.35; P = 0.01], reduced in-hospital mortality [28.3% 
vs. 41.3%, HR 0.56; P < 0.001], and prolonged intensive care unit (ICU) stay 
[15.8d vs 12.6d, HR 2.34; P < 0.001] and hospital stay [23.7d vs 19.7d, HR 4.47; 
P < 0.001]. No significant difference was found in vasopressor requirements in 
patients with SA-AKI. Nevertheless, results illustrated that dose receiving 
between 0.30 and 1.00 μg/kg/h and duration using under 48 h of dexmedetomidine 
was associated with improvements in renal function recovery in SA-AKI patients.
CONCLUSION: Dexmedetomidine administration was associated with improvements in 
renal function recovery and in-hospital survival in critically ill patients with 
SA-AKI. The results need to be verified in further randomized controlled trials.

BACKGROUND: Lung infection is a common cause of sepsis, and patients with sepsis 
and lung infection are more ill and have a higher mortality rate than sepsis 
patients without lung infection. We constructed a nomogram prediction model to 
accurately evaluate the prognosis of and provide treatment advice for patients 
with sepsis and lung infection.
METHODS: Data were retrospectively extracted from the Medical Information Mart 
for Intensive Care (MIMIC-III) open-source clinical database. The definition of 
Sepsis 3.0 [10] was used, which includes patients with life-threatening organ 
dysfunction caused by an uncontrolled host response to infection, and SOFA 
score ≥ 2. The nomogram prediction model was constructed from the training set 
using logistic regression analysis, and was then internally validated and 
underwent sensitivity analysis.
RESULTS: The risk factors of age, lactate, temperature, oxygenation index, BUN, 
lactate, Glasgow Coma Score (GCS), liver disease, cancer, organ transplantation, 
Troponin T(TnT), neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio (NLR), and CRRT, MV, and 
vasopressor use were included in the nomogram. We compared our nomogram with the 
Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (SOFA) score and Simplified Acute Physiology 
Score II (SAPSII), the nomogram had better discrimination ability, with areas 
under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUROC) of 0.743 (95% C.I.: 
0.713-0.773) and 0.746 (95% C.I.: 0.699-0.790) in the training and validation 
sets, respectively. The calibration plot indicated that the nomogram was 
adequate for predicting the in-hospital mortality risk in both sets. The 
decision-curve analysis (DCA) of the nomogram revealed that it provided net 
benefits for clinical use over using the SOFA score and SAPSII in both sets.
CONCLUSION: Our new nomogram is a convenient tool for accurate predictions of 
in-hospital mortality among ICU patients with sepsis and lung infection. 
Treatment strategies that improve the factors considered relevant in the model 
could increase in-hospital survival for these ICU patients.

BACKGROUND: Timely diagnosis is crucial for sepsis treatment. Current machine 
learning (ML) models suffer from high complexity and limited applicability. We 
therefore created an ML model using only complete blood count (CBC) diagnostics.
METHODS: We collected non-intensive care unit (non-ICU) data from a German 
tertiary care centre (January 2014 to December 2021). Using patient age, sex, 
and CBC parameters (haemoglobin, platelets, mean corpuscular volume, white and 
red blood cells), we trained a boosted random forest, which predicts sepsis with 
ICU admission. Two external validations were conducted using data from another 
German tertiary care centre and the Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care 
IV database (MIMIC-IV). Using the subset of laboratory orders also including 
procalcitonin (PCT), an analogous model was trained with PCT as an additional 
feature.
RESULTS: After exclusion, 1 381 358 laboratory requests (2016 from sepsis cases) 
were available. The CBC model shows an area under the receiver operating 
characteristic (AUROC) of 0.872 (95% CI, 0.857-0.887). External validations show 
AUROCs of 0.805 (95% CI, 0.787-0.824) for University Medicine Greifswald and 
0.845 (95% CI, 0.837-0.852) for MIMIC-IV. The model including PCT revealed a 
significantly higher AUROC (0.857; 95% CI, 0.836-0.877) than PCT alone (0.790; 
95% CI, 0.759-0.821; P < 0.001).
CONCLUSIONS: Our results demonstrate that routine CBC results could 
significantly improve diagnosis of sepsis when combined with ML. The CBC model 
can facilitate early sepsis prediction in non-ICU patients with high robustness 
in external validations. Its implementation in clinical decision support systems 
has strong potential to provide an essential time advantage and increase patient 
safety.

This research sought to ascertain the relationship between hematocrit (HCT) and 
mortality in patients with sepsis.
METHODS: A retrospective analysis was conducted on the clinical data of septic 
patients who were hospitalized between 2008 and 2019 in an advanced academic 
medical center in Boston, Massachusetts, registered in the Medical Information 
Mart for Intensive Care IV (MIMIC-IV) database, We analyzed basic information 
including gender, age, race, and types of the first admission, laboratory 
indicators including HCT, platelets, white blood cells, albumin, bilirubin, 
hemoglobin, and serum creatinine, and 30-day mortality. A Cox proportional 
hazards regression model was utilized to analyze the relationship between HCT 
and 30-day mortality in patients with sepsis.
RESULTS: This research recruited 2057 patients who met the research requirements 
from 2008 to 2019. According to the HCT level, it was classified into the low 
HCT level, the regular HCT level, and the high HCT level. The 30-day mortality 
rate was 62.6%, 27.5%, and 9.9% for patients with the low HCT level, the regular 
HCT level, and the high HCT level, respectively (p < 0.05). The multivariate Cox 
proportional hazard regression model analysis displayed that compared with 
patients with the regular HCT level, the 30-day mortality of patients with the 
low HCT level increased by 58.9% (hazard ratio = 1.589, 95% confidence interval 
(CI) = 1.009-2.979, p < 0.05).
CONCLUSION: The low HCT level is an independent risk factor for the increase of 
the 30-day mortality in patients with sepsis and can be used as a significant 
predictor of the clinical outcome of sepsis.

BACKGROUND: Septic patients with diabetes mellitus (DM) are more venerable to 
subsequent complications and the resultant increase in associated mortality. 
Therefore, it is important to make tailored clinical decisions for this 
subpopulation at admission.
METHOD: Data from large-scale real-world databases named the Medical Information 
Mart for Intensive Care Database (MIMIC) were reviewed. The least absolute 
selection and shrinkage operator (LASSO) was performed with 10 times 
cross-validation methods to select the optimal prognostic factors. Multivariate 
COX regression analysis was conducted to identify the independent prognostic 
factors and nomogram construction. The nomogram was internally validated via the 
bootstrapping method and externally validated by the MIMIC III database with 
receiver operating characteristic (ROC), calibration curves, decision curve 
analysis (DCA), and Kaplan-Meier curves for robustness check.
RESULTS: A total of 3,291 septic patients with DM were included in this study, 
2,227 in the MIMIC IV database and 1,064 in the MIMIC III database, 
respectively. In the training cohort, the 28-day all-cause mortality rate is 
23.9% septic patients with DM. The multivariate Cox regression analysis reveals 
age (hazard ratio (HR)=1.023, 95%CI: 1.016-1.031, p<0.001), respiratory failure 
(HR=1.872, 95%CI: 1.554-2.254, p<0.001), Sequential Organ Failure Assessment 
score (HR=1.056, 95%CI: 1.018-1.094, p=0.004); base excess (HR=0.980, 95%CI: 
0.967-0.992, p=0.002), anion gap (HR=1.100, 95%CI: 1.080-1.120, p<0.001), 
albumin (HR=0.679, 95%CI: 0.574-0.802, p<0.001), international normalized ratio 
(HR=1.087, 95%CI: 1.027-1.150, p=0.004), red cell distribution width (HR=1.056, 
95%CI: 1.021-1.092, p=0.001), temperature (HR=0.857, 95%CI: 0.789-0.932, 
p<0.001), and glycosylated hemoglobin (HR=1.358, 95%CI: 1.320-1.401, p<0.001) at 
admission are independent prognostic factors for 28-day all-cause mortality of 
septic patients with DM. The established nomogram shows satisfied accuracy and 
clinical utility with AUCs of 0.870 in the internal validation and 0.830 in the 
external validation cohort as well as 0.820 in the septic shock subpopulation, 
which is superior to the predictive value of the single SOFA score.
CONCLUSION: Our results suggest that admission characteristics show an optimal 
prediction value for short-term mortality in septic patients with DM. The 
established model can support intensive care unit physicians in making better 
initial clinical decisions for this subpopulation.

OBJECTIVE: Sepsis remains a high cause of death, particularly in 
immunocompromised patients with cancer. The study was to develop a model to 
predict hospital mortality of septic patients with cancer in intensive care unit 
(ICU).
DESIGN: Retrospective observational study.
SETTING: Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care IV (MIMIC IV) and eICU 
Collaborative Research Database (eICU-CRD).
PARTICIPANTS: A total of 3796 patients in MIMIC IV and 549 patients in eICU-CRD 
were included.
PRIMARY OUTCOME MEASURES: The model was developed based on MIMIC IV. The 
internal validation and external validation were based on MIMIC IV and eICU-CRD, 
respectively. Candidate factors were processed with the least absolute shrinkage 
and selection operator regression and cross-validation. Hospital mortality was 
predicted by the multivariable logistical regression and visualised by the 
nomogram. The model was assessed by the area under the curve (AUC), calibration 
curve and decision curve analysis curve.
RESULTS: The model exhibited favourable discrimination (AUC: 0.726 (95% CI: 
0.709 to 0.744) and 0.756 (95% CI: 0.712 to 0.801)) in the internal and external 
validation sets, respectively, and better calibration capacity than Acute 
Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation IV in external validation.
CONCLUSIONS: Despite that the predicted model was based on a retrospective 
study, it may also be helpful to predict the hospital morality of patients with 
solid cancer and sepsis.

BACKGROUND: Sepsis is a life-threatening syndrome eliciting highly heterogeneous 
host responses. Current prognostic evaluation methods used in clinical practice 
are characterized by an inadequate effectiveness in predicting sepsis mortality. 
Rapid identification of patients with high mortality risk is urgently needed. 
The phenotyping of patients will assistant invaluably in tailoring treatments.
METHODS: Machine learning and deep learning technology are used to characterize 
the patients' phenotype and determine the sepsis severity. The database used in 
this study is MIMIC-III and MIMIC-IV ('Medical information Mart for intensive 
care') which is a large, public, and freely available database. The K-means 
clustering is used to classify the sepsis phenotype. Convolutional neural 
network (CNN) was used to predict the 28-day survival rate based on 35 blood 
test variables of the sepsis patients, whereas a double coefficient quadratic 
multivariate fitting function (DCQMFF) is utilized to predict the 28-day 
survival rate with only 11 features of sepsis patients.
RESULTS: The patients were grouped into four clusters with a clear survival 
nomogram. The first cluster (C_1) was characterized by low white blood cell 
count, low neutrophil, and the highest lymphocyte proportion. C_2 obtained the 
lowest Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (SOFA) score and the highest survival 
rate. C_3 was characterized by significantly prolonged PTT, high SIC, and a 
higher proportion of patients using heparin than the patients in other clusters. 
The early mortality rate of patients in C_3 was high but with a better long-term 
survival rate than that in C_4. C_4 contained septic coagulation patients with 
the worst prognosis, characterized by slightly prolonged partial thromboplastin 
time (PTT), significantly prolonged prothrombin time (PT), and high septic 
coagulation disease score (SIC). The survival rate prediction accuracy of CNN 
and DCQMFF models reached 92% and 82%, respectively. The models were tested on 
an external dataset (MIMIC-IV) and achieved good performance. A DCQMFF-based 
application platform was established for fast prediction of the 28-day survival 
rate.
CONCLUSION: CNN and DCQMFF accurately predicted the sepsis patients' survival, 
while K-means successfully identified the phenotype groups. The distinct 
phenotypes associated with survival, and significant features correlated with 
mortality were identified. The findings suggest that sepsis patients with 
abnormal coagulation had poor outcomes, abnormal coagulation increase mortality 
during sepsis. The anticoagulation effects of appropriate heparin sodium 
treatment may improve extensive micro thrombosis-caused organ failure.

PURPOSE: Traumatic brain injury (TBI) patients admitted to the intensive care 
unit (ICU) are at a high risk of infection and sepsis. However, there are few 
studies on predicting secondary sepsis in TBI patients in the ICU. This study 
aimed to build a prediction model for the risk of secondary sepsis in TBI 
patients in the ICU, and provide effective information for clinical diagnosis 
and treatment.
METHODS: Using the MIMIC IV database version 2.0 (Medical Information Mart for 
Intensive Care IV), we searched data on TBI patients admitted to ICU and 
considered them as a study cohort. The extracted data included patient 
demographic information, laboratory indicators, complications, and other 
clinical data. The study cohort was divided into a training cohort and a 
validation cohort. In the training cohort, variables were screened by LASSO 
(Least absolute shrinkage and selection operator) regression and stepwise 
Logistic regression to assess the predictive ability of each feature on the 
incidence of patients. The screened variables were included in the final 
Logistic regression model. Finally, the decision curve, calibration curve, and 
receiver operating character (ROC) were used to test the performance of the 
model.
RESULTS: Finally, a total of 1167 patients were included in the study, and these 
patients were randomly divided into the training (N = 817) and validation 
(N = 350) cohorts at a ratio of 7:3. In the training cohort, seven features were 
identified as key predictors of secondary sepsis in TBI patients in the ICU, 
including acute kidney injury (AKI), anemia, invasive ventilation, GCS (Glasgow 
Coma Scale) score, lactic acid, and blood calcium level, which were included in 
the final model. The areas under the ROC curve in the training cohort and the 
validation cohort were 0.756 and 0.711, respectively. The calibration curve and 
ROC curve show that the model has favorable predictive accuracy, while the 
decision curve shows that the model has favorable clinical benefits with good 
and robust predictive efficiency.
CONCLUSION: We have developed a nomogram model for predicting secondary sepsis 
in TBI patients admitted to the ICU, which can provide useful predictive 
information for clinical decision-making.

PURPOSE: Measurement of central venous pressure (CVP) can be a useful clinical 
tool. However, the formal utility of CVP measurement in preventing mortality in 
septic patients has never been proven.
METHODS: The Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care III (MIMIC-III) 
database was searched to identify septic patients with and without CVP 
measurements. The primary outcome was 28-day mortality. Multivariate regression 
was used to elucidate the relationship between CVP measurement and 28-day 
mortality, and propensity score matching (PSM) and an inverse probability of 
treatment weighing (IPTW) were employed to validate our findings.
RESULTS: A total of 10,275 patients were included in our study, of which 4516 
patients (44%) underwent CVP measurement within 24 h of intensive care unit 
(ICU) admission. The risk of 28-day mortality was reduced in the CVP group (OR 
0.60 (95% CI 0.51-0.70; p < 0.001)). Patients in the CVP group received more 
fluid on day 1 and had a shorter duration of mechanical ventilation and 
vasopressor use, and the reduction in serum lactate was greater than that in the 
no CVP group. The mediating effect of serum lactate reduction was significant 
for the whole cohort (p = 0.04 for the average causal mediation effect (ACME)) 
and patients in the CVP group with an initial CVP level below 8 mmHg (p = 0.04 
for the ACME).
CONCLUSION: CVP measurement was associated with decreased risk-adjusted 28-day 
mortality among patients with sepsis and was proportionally mediated through 
serum lactate reduction.

BACKGROUND: Minimal data exist on anticoagulation use and timing and the dose of 
heparin in patients with sepsis, and whether heparin use improves sepsis 
survival remains largely unclear. This study was performed to assess whether 
heparin administration would provide a survival advantage in critically ill 
patients with sepsis.
METHODS: A retrospective cohort study of patients with sepsis in the Medical 
Information Mart for Intensive Care (MIMIC)-IV database was conducted. Cox 
proportional hazards model and propensity score matching (PSM) were used to 
evaluate the outcomes of prophylactic anticoagulation with heparin administered 
by subcutaneous injection within 48 h of intensive care unit (ICU) admission. 
The primary outcome was in-hospital mortality. Secondary outcomes included 
60-day mortality, length of ICU stay, length of hospital stay and incidence of 
acute kidney injury (AKI) on day 7. E-Value analysis were used for unmeasured 
confounding.
RESULTS: A total of 6646 adult septic patients were included and divided into an 
early prophylactic heparin group (n = 3211) and a nonheparin group (n = 3435). 
In-hospital mortality in the heparin therapy group was significantly lower than 
that in the nonheparin group (prematched 14.7 vs 20.0%, hazard ratio (HR) 0.77, 
95% confidence interval (CI) [0.68-0.87], p < 0.001, and postmatched 14.9 vs 
18.3%, HR 0.78, 95% CI [0.68-0.89], p < 0.001). Secondary endpoints, including 
60-day mortality and length of ICU stay, differed between the heparin and 
nonheparin groups (p < 0.01). Early prophylactic heparin administration was 
associated with in-hospital mortality among septic patients in different 
adjusted covariates (HR 0.71-0.78, p < 0.001), and only administration of five 
doses of heparin was associated with decreased in-hospital mortality after PSM 
(HR 0.70, 95% CI 0.56-0.87, p < 0.001). Subgroup analysis showed that heparin 
use was significantly associated with reduced in-hospital mortality in patients 
with sepsis-induced coagulopathy, septic shock, sequential organ failure 
assessment score ≥ 10, AKI, mechanical ventilation, gram-positive bacterial 
infection and gram-negative bacterial infection, with HRs of 0.74, 0.70, 0.58, 
0.74, 0.73, 0.64 and 0.72, respectively (p <0.001). E-Value analysis suggested 
robustness to unmeasured confounding.
CONCLUSIONS: This study found an association between early administration 
prophylactic heparin provided to patients with sepsis and reduced risk-adjusted 
mortality. A prospective randomized-controlled study should be designed to 
further assess the relevant findings.

BACKGROUND: Elderly patients with sepsis have many comorbidities, and the 
clinical reaction is not obvious. Thus, clinical treatment is difficult. We 
planned to use the laboratory test results and comorbidities of elderly patients 
with sepsis from a large-scale public database Medical Information Mart for 
Intensive Care (MIMIC) IV to build a random survival forest (RSF) model and to 
evaluate the model's predictive value for these patients.
METHODS: Clinical information of elderly patients with sepsis in MIMIC IV 
database was collected retrospectively. Machine learning (RSF) was used to 
select the top 30 variables in the training cohort to build the final RSF model. 
The model was compared with the traditional scoring systems SOFA, SAPSII, and 
APSIII. The performance of the model was evaluated by C index and calibration 
curve.
RESULTS: A total of 6,503 patients were enrolled in the study. The top 30 
important variables screened by RSF were used to construct the final RSF model. 
The new model provided a better C-index (0.731 in the validation cohort). The 
calibration curve described the agreement between the predicted probability of 
RSF model and the observed 30-day survival.
CONCLUSIONS: We constructed a prognostic model to predict a 30-day mortality 
risk in elderly patients with sepsis based on machine learning (RSF algorithm), 
and it proved superior to the traditional scoring systems. The risk factors 
affecting the patients were also ranked. In addition to the common risk factors 
of vasopressors, ventilator use, and urine output. Newly added factors such as 
RDW, type of ICU unit, malignant cancer, and metastatic solid tumor also 
significantly influence prognosis.

BACKGROUND: The mortality rate of patients with sepsis-associated acute kidney 
injury (SA-AKI) in the intensive care unit (ICU) is high, and there is a need 
for early identification of SA-AKI patients with poor prognoses. This study 
investigated the relationship between the lactate dehydrogenase to serum albumin 
ratio (LAR) and prognosis in patients with SA-AKI.
METHODS: We performed a retrospective cohort study of patients with SA-AKI who 
are represented in the Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care IV 
(MIMIC-IV). We used multivariable Cox regression analysis to determine adjusted 
hazard ratios (HRs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs). Subgroup analysis, 
survival curves, and curve fitting were used to evaluate a connection between 
the LAR and prognosis in patients with SA-AKI.
RESULTS: There were a total of 6453 participants in this research. The average 
age of the participants was 63.9 ± 16.1 years, and the average LAR was 11.0 
(7.6, 17.7)/IU/g. After controlling for variables, the HRs for 28-day mortality 
were 1.20 (HR: 1.20, 95% CI: 1.05-1.38, p = 0.008) and 1.61 (HR: 1.61, 95% CI: 
1.41-1.84, p < 0.001) for Tertile 2 (T2, 8.59≤ LAR< 14.66) and Tertile 3 (T3, 
LAR ≥ 14.66), respectively, compared to Tertile 1 (T1, LAR < 8.59). The outcomes 
for 90-day mortality and in-hospital death rate were comparable. The 
Kaplan-Meier (KM) analysis revealed that the group with greater LAR had higher 
28-day and 90-day death rates.
CONCLUSION: Our study shows that LAR is associated with poor prognosis in 
patients with SA-AKI. Higher LAR is associated with higher 28-day, 90-day, and 
in-hospital mortality.

BACKGROUND: Current classification for acute kidney injury (AKI) in critically 
ill patients with sepsis relies only on its severity-measured by maximum 
creatinine which overlooks inherent complexities and longitudinal evaluation of 
this heterogenous syndrome. The role of classification of AKI based on early 
creatinine trajectories is unclear.
METHODS: This retrospective study identified patients with Sepsis-3 who 
developed AKI within 48-h of intensive care unit admission using Medical 
Information Mart for Intensive Care-IV database. We used latent class mixed 
modelling to identify early creatinine trajectory-based classes of AKI in 
critically ill patients with sepsis. Our primary outcome was development of 
acute kidney disease (AKD). Secondary outcomes were composite of AKD or 
all-cause in-hospital mortality by day 7, and AKD or all-cause in-hospital 
mortality by hospital discharge. We used multivariable regression to assess 
impact of creatinine trajectory-based classification on outcomes, and eICU 
database for external validation.
RESULTS: Among 4197 patients with AKI in critically ill patients with sepsis, we 
identified eight creatinine trajectory-based classes with distinct 
characteristics. Compared to the class with transient AKI, the class that showed 
severe AKI with mild improvement but persistence had highest adjusted risks for 
developing AKD (OR 5.16; 95% CI 2.87-9.24) and composite 7-day outcome (HR 4.51; 
95% CI 2.69-7.56). The class that demonstrated late mild AKI with persistence 
and worsening had highest risks for developing composite hospital discharge 
outcome (HR 2.04; 95% CI 1.41-2.94). These associations were similar on external 
validation.
CONCLUSIONS: These 8 classes of AKI in critically ill patients with sepsis, 
stratified by early creatinine trajectories, were good predictors for key 
outcomes in patients with AKI in critically ill patients with sepsis independent 
of their AKI staging.

Systemic immune-inflammation index (SII) has been identified as a prognostic 
biomarker for various diseases. Our study aimed to investigate the association 
between SII and mortality risk in critically ill patients with sepsis, thus 
exploring possible tools for rapid screening. This retrospective cohort study 
was conducted using clinical data extracted from the Medical Information Mart 
for Intensive Care Database. The study included only patients diagnosed with 
sepsis admitted to the intensive care unit for the first time. We used the 
restricted cubic splines to explore the relationship between SII and 28-day 
mortality. Kaplan-Meier curve and Cox regression models were performed to 
evaluate the association between SII and mortality. Subgroup analysis was 
performed to explore the stability of the primary results. A total of 16,007 
patients with sepsis were eligible in the final analysis. We found a J-shaped 
relationship between SII and mortality risk. The SII level associated with the 
lowest mortality risk was 774.46*109/L. Compared with the reference group 
(second SII quartile), the 28-day mortality was increased in the highest 
quartile and third quartile groups of SII levels; fully adjusted HRs were 1.16 
(1.02 to 1.32) and 1.40 (1.23 to 1.58), respectively. However, although the 
lower SII (Q1 group) also showed a trend toward a higher hazard of 28-day 
mortality, there was no statistical difference, with a fully adjusted HR of 1.05 
(0.92 to 1.21). In the population of critically ill patients with sepsis, low 
and high SII levels were associated with an increased risk of short-term 
mortality. The 28-day mortality risk was lowest at SII levels of 774.46*109/L.

OBJECTIVE: Sepsis-induced coagulopathy (SIC) is extremely common in individuals 
with sepsis, significantly associated with poor outcomes. This study attempted 
to develop an interpretable and generalizable machine learning (ML) model for 
early predicting the risk of 28-day death in patients with SIC.
METHODS: In this retrospective cohort study, we extracted SIC patients from the 
Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care III (MIMIC-III), MIMIC-IV, and 
eICU-CRD database according to Toshiaki Iba's scale. And the overlapping in the 
MIMIC-IV was excluded for this study. Afterward, only the MIMIC-III cohort was 
randomly divided into the training set, and the internal validation set 
according to the ratio of 7:3, while the MIMIC-IV and eICU-CRD databases were 
considered the external validation sets. The predictive factors for 28-day 
mortality of SIC patients were determined using recursive feature elimination 
combined with tenfold cross-validation (RFECV). Then, we constructed models 
using ML algorithms. Multiple metrics were used for evaluation of performance of 
the models, including the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve 
(AUROC), area under the precision recall curve (AUPRC), accuracy, sensitivity, 
specificity, negative predictive value, positive predictive value, recall, and 
F1 score. Finally, Shapley Additive Explanations (SHAP), Local Interpretable 
Model-Agnostic Explanations (LIME) were employed to provide a reasonable 
interpretation for the prediction results.
RESULTS: A total of 3280, 2798, and 1668 SIC patients were screened from 
MIMIC-III, MIMIC-IV, and eICU-CRD databases, respectively. Seventeen features 
were selected to construct ML prediction models. XGBoost had the best 
performance in predicting the 28-day mortality of SIC patients, with AUC of 
0.828, 0.913 and 0.923, the AUPRC of 0.807, 0.796 and 0.921, the accuracy of 
0.785, 0.885 and 0.891, the F1 scores were 0.63, 0.69 and 0.70 in MIMIC-III 
(internal validation set), MIMIC-IV, and eICU-CRD databases. The importance 
ranking and SHAP analyses showed that initial SOFA score, red blood cell 
distribution width (RDW), and age were the top three critical features in the 
XGBoost model.
CONCLUSIONS: We developed an optimal and explainable ML model to predict the 
risk of 28-day death of SIC patients 28-day death risk. Compared with 
conventional scoring systems, the XGBoost model performed better. The model 
established will have the potential to improve the level of clinical practice 
for SIC patients.

BACKGROUND: Sepsis is a common critical condition caused by the body's 
overwhelming response to certain infective agents. Many biomarkers, including 
the serum lactate level, have been used for sepsis diagnosis and guiding 
treatment. Recently, the Third International Consensus Definitions for Sepsis 
and Septic Shock (Sepsis-3) recommended the Sequential Organ Failure Assessment 
(SOFA) and the quick SOFA (qSOFA) rather than lactate for screening sepsis and 
assess prognosis. Here, we aim to explore and compare the prognostic accuracy of 
the lactate level, the SOFA score and the qSOFA score for mortality in septic 
patients using the public Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care III 
database (MIMIC III).
METHODS: The baseline characteristics, laboratory test results and outcomes for 
sepsis patients were retrieved from MIMIC III. Survival was analysed by the 
Kaplan-Meier method. Univariate and multivariate analysis was performed to 
identify predictors of prognosis. Receiver operating characteristic curve (ROC) 
analysis was conducted to compare lactate with SOFA and qSOFA scores.
RESULTS: A total of 3713 cases were initially identified. The analysis cohort 
included 1865 patients. The 24-h average lactate levels and the worst scores 
during the first 24 h of ICU admission were collected. Patients in the higher 
lactate group had higher mortality than those in the lower lactate group. 
Lactate was an independent predictor of sepsis prognosis. The AUROC of lactate 
(AUROC, 0.664 [95% CI, 0.639-0.689]) was significantly higher than that of qSOFA 
(AUROC, 0.547 [95% CI, 0.521-0.574]), and it was similar to the AUROC of SOFA 
(AUROC, 0.686 [95% CI, 0.661-0.710]). But the timing of lactate relative to SOFA 
and qSOFA scores was inconsistent.
CONCLUSION: Lactate is an independent prognostic predictor of mortality for 
patients with sepsis. It has superior discriminative power to qSOFA, and shows 
discriminative ability similar to that of SOFA.

OBJECTIVE: To develop a nomogram for predicting the occurrence of 
sepsis-associated delirium (SAD).
MATERIALS AND METHODS: Data from a total of 642 patients were retrieved from the 
Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care (MIMIC III) database to build a 
prediction model. Multivariate logistic regression was performed to identify 
independent predictors and establish a nomogram to predict the occurrence of 
SAD. The performance of the nomogram was assessed in terms of discrimination and 
calibration by bootstrapping with 1000 resamples.
RESULTS: Multivariate logistic regression identified 4 independent predictors 
for patients with SAD, including Sepsis-related Organ Failure Assessment(SOFA) 
(p = 0.004; OR: 1.131; 95% CI 1.040 to 1.231), mechanical ventilation 
(P < 0.001; OR: 3.710; 95% CI 2.452 to 5.676), phosphate (P = 0.047; OR: 1.165; 
95% CI 1.003 to 1.358), and lactate (P = 0.023; OR: 1.135; 95% CI 1.021 to 
1.270) within 24 h of intensive care unit (ICU) admission. The area under the 
curve (AUC) of the predictive model was 0.742 in the training set and 0.713 in 
the validation set. The Hosmer - Lemeshow test showed that the model was a good 
fit (p = 0.471). The calibration curve of the predictive model was close to the 
ideal curve in both the training and validation sets. The DCA curve also showed 
that the predictive nomogram was clinically useful.
CONCLUSION: We constructed a nomogram for the personalized prediction of 
delirium in sepsis patients, which had satisfactory performance and clinical 
utility and thus could help clinicians identify patients with SAD in a timely 
manner, perform early intervention, and improve their neurological outcomes.

BACKGROUND: The effectiveness of aspirin treatment in septic patients remains a 
subject of debates.
OBJECTIVE: To explore the association between aspirin usage and the prognosis of 
patients with sepsis-induced myocardial injury (SIMI), as well as the timing of 
aspirin administration.
METHODS: Patients with SIMI were screened in the MIMIC-IV database and 
categorized into aspirin and non-aspirin groups based on their medications 
during intensive care unit (ICU) stay, and propensity matching analysis (PSM) 
was subsequently performed to reduce bias at baseline between the groups. The 
primary outcome was 28-day all-cause mortality. Cox multivariate regression 
analysis was conducted to evaluate the impact of aspirin on the prognosis of 
patients with SIMI.
RESULTS: The pre-PSM and post-PSM cohorts included 1170 and 1055 patients, 
respectively. In the pre-PSM cohort, the aspirin group is older, has a higher 
proportion of chronic comorbidities, and lower SOFA and SAPS II scores when 
compared to the non-aspirin group. In the PSM analysis, most of the baseline 
characterization biases were corrected, and aspirin use was also associated with 
lower 28-day mortality (hazard ratio [HR] = 0.51, 95 % confidence interval [CI]: 
0.42-0.63, P < 0.001), 90-day mortality (HR = 0.58, 95 % CI: 0.49-0.69, 
P < 0.001) and 1-year mortality (HR = 0.65, 95 % CI: 0.56-0.76, P < 0.001), 
irrespective of aspirin administration timing. A sensitivity analysis based on 
the original cohort confirmed the robustness of the findings. Additionally, 
subsequent subgroup analysis revealed that the use of vasopressin have a 
significant interaction with aspirin's efficacy.
CONCLUSION: Aspirin was associated with decreased mortality in SIMI patients, 
and this beneficial effect persisted regardless of pre-ICU treatment.

Magnesium imbalances commonly exist in septic patients. However, the association 
of serum magnesium levels with mortality in septic patients remains uncertain. 
Herein, we elucidated the association between serum magnesium and all-cause 
mortality in septic patients from American and Chinese cohorts by analyzing data 
from 9099 patients in the Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care-IV 
(MIMIC-IV) database and 1727 patients from a university-affiliated hospital' 
intensive care unit in China. Patients in both cohorts were categorized into 
five groups based on serum magnesium quintiles from the MIMIC-IV dataset. 
Patients with higher serum magnesium levels exhibited an increased risk of 
28-day mortality in both cohorts. The restricted cubic spline (RCS) curves 
revealed a progressively elevated risk of 28-day mortality with increasing serum 
magnesium in MIMIC-IV cohort, while a J-shaped correlation was observed in 
institutional cohort. Our findings have validated the association between high 
serum magnesium and high mortality in sepsis across different races and medical 
conditions. Serum magnesium levels might be useful in identifying septic 
patients at higher mortality risk.

BACKGROUND: Intensive care research has predominantly relied on conventional 
methods like randomized controlled trials. However, the increasing popularity of 
open-access, free databases in the past decade has opened new avenues for 
research, offering fresh insights. Leveraging machine learning (ML) techniques 
enables the analysis of trends in a vast number of studies.
OBJECTIVE: This study aims to conduct a comprehensive bibliometric analysis 
using ML to compare trends and research topics in traditional intensive care 
unit (ICU) studies and those done with open-access databases (OADs).
METHODS: We used ML for the analysis of publications in the Web of Science 
database in this study. Articles were categorized into "OAD" and "traditional 
intensive care" (TIC) studies. OAD studies were included in the Medical 
Information Mart for Intensive Care (MIMIC), eICU Collaborative Research 
Database (eICU-CRD), Amsterdam University Medical Centers Database 
(AmsterdamUMCdb), High Time Resolution ICU Dataset (HiRID), and Pediatric 
Intensive Care database. TIC studies included all other intensive care studies. 
Uniform manifold approximation and projection was used to visualize the corpus 
distribution. The BERTopic technique was used to generate 30 topic-unique 
identification numbers and to categorize topics into 22 topic families.
RESULTS: A total of 227,893 records were extracted. After exclusions, 145,426 
articles were identified as TIC and 1301 articles as OAD studies. TIC studies 
experienced exponential growth over the last 2 decades, culminating in a peak of 
16,378 articles in 2021, while OAD studies demonstrated a consistent upsurge 
since 2018. Sepsis, ventilation-related research, and pediatric intensive care 
were the most frequently discussed topics. TIC studies exhibited broader 
coverage than OAD studies, suggesting a more extensive research scope.
CONCLUSIONS: This study analyzed ICU research, providing valuable insights from 
a large number of publications. OAD studies complement TIC studies, focusing on 
predictive modeling, while TIC studies capture essential qualitative 
information. Integrating both approaches in a complementary manner is the future 
direction for ICU research. Additionally, natural language processing techniques 
offer a transformative alternative for literature review and bibliometric 
analysis.

OBJECTIVES: This study aims to develop and validate a prediction model 
in-hospital mortality in critically ill patients with sepsis-associated acute 
kidney injury (SA-AKI) based on machine learning algorithms.
METHODS: Patients who met the criteria for inclusion were identified in the 
Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care-IV (MIMIC-IV) database and divided 
according to the validation (n = 2440) and development (n = 9756, 80%) queues. 
Ensemble stepwise feature selection method was used to screen for effective 
features. The prediction models of short-term mortality were developed by seven 
machine learning algorithms. Ten-fold cross-validation was used to verify the 
performance of the algorithm in the development queue. The area under the 
receiver operating characteristic curve (ROC-AUC) was used to evaluate the 
differentiation accuracy and performance of the prediction model in the 
validation queue. The best-performing model was interpreted by Shapley additive 
explanations (SHAP).
RESULTS: A total of 12,196 patients were enrolled in this study. Eleven 
variables were finally chosen to develop the prediction model. The AUC of the 
random forest (RF) model was the highest value both in the Ten-fold 
cross-validation and evaluation (AUC: 0.798, 95% CI: 0.774-0.821). According to 
the SHAP plots, old age, low Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) score, high AKI stage, 
reduced urine output, high Simplified Acute Physiology Score (SAPS II), high 
respiratory rate, low temperature, low absolute lymphocyte count, high 
creatinine level, dysnatremia, and low body mass index (BMI) increased the risk 
of poor prognosis.
CONCLUSIONS: The RF model developed in this study is a good predictor of 
in-hospital mortality for patients with SA-AKI in the intensive care unit (ICU), 
which may have potential applications in mortality prediction.

BACKGROUND: Statins exert pleiotropic anti-inflammatory and antioxidant effects 
in addition to their cholesterol-lowering properties. This study aimed to 
investigate whether statin use is associated with improved outcomes of sepsis.
METHODS: Data from patients with sepsis were extracted from the Medical 
Information Mart for Intensive Care IV database. Patients with a history of 
receiving prescriptions for statins (i.e., atorvastatin, lovastatin, 
pitavastatin, pravastatin, rosuvastatin, or simvastatin) were matched with 
non-users using propensity-score matching, to balance confounding factors 
between the groups. Mendelian randomization (MR) analyses were performed using 
information from the UK Biobank dataset to explore the potential causal link 
between low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) levels and LDL-C lowering 
effects via genetically inhibiting β‑hydroxy β-methylglutaryl-coenzyme A 
reductase and the susceptibility to sepsis, and the sepsis-related 28-day 
mortality.
MAIN RESULTS: 90-day mortality rate was lower among the 10,323 statin users when 
compared to matched non-users [hazard ratio (HR): 0.612, 95% CI: 0.571 to 
0.655]. In-hospital mortality was also lower for statin users compared to 
non-users (11.3% vs. 17.8%, p < 0.0001, HR: 0.590, 95% CI: 0.548 to 0.634). 
Statin use was associated with better outcome in all investigated subpopulations 
apart from patients with severe liver disease. MR analyses further pointed 
toward pleiotropic effects beyond lipid-lowering effects of statins on 
sepsis-related outcomes.
CONCLUSIONS: Statin use is associated with improved outcomes following 
sepsis-related intensive care unit (ICU) admission, most likely from its 
pleiotropic properties, characterized by lower 90-day and in-hospital mortality 
among statin users.

BACKGROUND: The objective of this study was to explore the correlation between 
statin administration in the intensive care unit (ICU) setting and the 
in-hospital mortality risk of patients suffering from sepsis-induced 
coagulopathy (SIC).
METHODS: Utilizing a retrospective cohort study design, this investigation 
collected data from the Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care (MIMIC)-IV 
spanning 2008 to 2019. The diagnosis of SIC was established based on a SIC score 
of 4 or above. Statin usage during the ICU period was extracted from the 
prescription records based on the keywords of statin medications. The primary 
endpoint analyzed was the in-hospital mortality within the ICU, characterized by 
any death occurring during the ICU admission.
RESULTS: During the follow-up, which had a median duration of approximately 7.28 
days, 18.19% of the 4,777 SIC patients died in the ICU. Statin was linked with a 
decrease in the risk of in-hospital mortality for SIC patients in the ICU 
[hazard ratio (HR): 0.73, 95% confidence interval (CI): 0.60-0.89, P = 0.002]. 
Relative to rosuvastatin, the use of atorvastatin (HR: 0.54, 95% CI: 0.34-0.85, 
P = 0.008) or simvastatin (HR: 0.55, 95% CI: 0.33-0.92, P = 0.024), as well as 
combinations of multiple statins (HR: 0.36, 95% CI: 0.15-0.86, P = 0.022), was 
associated with a reduction in ICU in-hospital mortality risk. Subgroup analysis 
also suggested that the use of atorvastatin, simvastatin, or a combination of 
statins had an advantage over rosuvastatin in reducing ICU in-hospital mortality 
in SIC patients older than 65 years of age or SIC patients with respiratory 
failure or cardiogenic shock (all P < 0.05).
CONCLUSION: The present study supports the potential benefits of statin use in 
mortality in SIC patients during ICU stays. The study encourages clinicians to 
consider the benefits of statins and supports the ongoing exploration of statins 
for enhanced outcomes in critical care settings.

In this study, we aimed to investigate the risk factors associated with 
in-hospital mortality in patients with cirrhosis and sepsis, establish and 
validate the nomogram. This retrospective study included patients diagnosed with 
liver cirrhosis and sepsis in the Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care IV 
(MIMIC-IV). Models were compared by the area under the curve (AUC), integrated 
discriminant improvement (IDI), net reclassification index (NRI) and decision 
curve analysis (DCA). A total of 1,696 patients with cirrhosis and sepsis were 
included in the final cohort. Our final model included the following 9 
variables: age, heartrate, total bilirubin (TBIL), glucose, sodium, anion gap 
(AG), fungal infections, mechanical ventilation, and vasopressin. The nomogram 
were constructed based on these variables. The AUC values of the nomograms were 
0.805 (95% CI 0.776-0.833), which provided significantly higher discrimination 
compared to that of SOFA score [0.684 (95% CI 0.647-0.720)], MELD-Na [0.672 (95% 
CI 0.636-0.709)] and ABIC [0.674(95% CI 0.638-0.710)]. We established the first 
nomogram for predicting in-hospital mortality in patients with liver cirrhosis 
and sepsis based on these factors. This nomogram can performs well and 
facilitates clinicians to identify people at high risk of in-hospital mortality.

Although accumulating researches were done for investigating the relationship 
between triglyceride-glucose index (TyG index) and different diseases, none of 
the researches have been made in sepsis yet. In this study, we aimed to explore 
the relationship between TyG index and clinical outcomes in sepsis based on a 
large critical care public database. Sepsis patients in Medical Information Mart 
for Intensive Care IV (MIMIC-IV) Database were included. The exposure was TyG 
index, which was calculated by the equation: ln (TG (mg/dL) × FBG (mg/dL)/2). 
The outcomes were in-hospital mortality and 1-year mortality. The relationship 
between TyG index and outcomes was performed by Cox regression analysis. Smooth 
fitting curves were constructed by using generalized additive model. 
Kaplan-Meier analyses for cumulative hazard of 1-year mortality in different 
groups were done. 1103 sepsis patients were included with a median TyG index of 
9.78. The mortalities of in-hospital and 1-year were 37.53% (n = 414) and 42.25% 
(n = 466), respectively. After adjusting confounders, there was a significantly 
negative relationship between TyG index and mortalities of in-hospital and 
1-year. With the per unit increment in TyG index, the risk of in-hospital and 
1-year mortality both decreased by 21% (HR = 0.79, 95% CI: 0.66-0.94, p = 0.0086 
and HR = 0.79, 95% CI: 0.66-0.94, p = 0.0080, respectively). A negative 
relationship between TyG index and clinical outcomes in sepsis was found.

BACKGROUND: Urinary tract infection (UTI) is a common cause of sepsis. Elderly 
patients with urosepsis in intensive care unit (ICU) have more severe conditions 
and higher mortality rates owing to factors such as advanced age, 
immunosenescence, and persistent host inflammatory responses. However, 
comprehensive studies on nomograms to predict the in-hospital mortality risk in 
elderly patients with urosepsis are lacking. This study aimed to construct a 
nomogram predictive model to accurately assess the prognosis of elderly patients 
with urosepsis and provide therapeutic recommendations.
METHODS: Data of elderly patients with urosepsis were extracted from the Medical 
Information Mart for Intensive Care (MIMIC) IV 2.2 database. Patients were 
randomly divided into training and validation cohorts. A predictive nomogram 
model was constructed from the training set using logistic regression analysis, 
followed by internal validation and sensitivity analysis.
RESULTS: This study included 1,251 patients. LASSO regression analysis revealed 
that the Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) score, red cell distribution width (RDW), 
white blood count (WBC), and invasive ventilation were independent risk factors 
identified from a total of 43 variables studied. We then created and verified a 
nomogram. The area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC), net 
reclassification improvement (NRI), integrated discrimination improvement (IDI), 
and decision curve analysis (DCA) of the nomogram were superior to those of the 
traditional SAPS-II, APACHE-II, and SOFA scoring systems. The Hosmer-Lemeshow 
test results and calibration curves suggested good nomogram calibration. The IDI 
and NRI values showed that our nomogram scoring tool performed better than the 
other scoring systems. The DCA curves showed good clinical applicability of the 
nomogram.
CONCLUSIONS: The nomogram constructed in this study is a convenient tool for 
accurately predicting in-hospital mortality in elderly patients with urosepsis 
in ICU. Improving the treatment strategies for factors related to the model 
could improve the in-hospital survival rates of these patients.

BACKGROUND: The obesity paradox suggests that individuals with obesity may have 
a survival advantage against specific critical illnesses, including sepsis. 
However, whether this paradox occurs at younger ages remains unclear. Therefore, 
we aimed to investigate whether obesity could improve survival in younger adult 
patients with sepsis.
METHODS: We used clinical data sourced from the Medical Information Mart for 
Intensive Care IV (MIMIC-IV) database. Patients with Sequential Organ Failure 
Assessment score ≥2 and suspected infection at the time of ICU admission were 
identified as having sepsis, following the Sepsis-3 definition. Individuals were 
classified into the obesity (BMI ≥30 kg/m²) and non-obesity (BMI <30 kg/m²) 
groups. Patients aged <50 and ≥50 years were categorized as younger adult 
patients and older patients, respectively.
RESULTS: Of 73,181 patients in the MIMIC-IV ICU database, 18,120 satisfied the 
inclusion criteria: 2642 aged <50 years and 15,478 aged ≥50 years. The 
Kaplan-Meier curve showed that obesity was not associated with an improved 
mortality rate among younger adult patients with sepsis (log-rank test: 
P = 0.197), while obesity exhibited a survival benefit in older patients with 
sepsis (log-rank test: P < 0.001). After propensity score matching, in-hospital 
mortality did not differ significantly between the obesity and non-obesity 
groups (13.3% vs. 12.2%; P = 0.457) in the younger adult patients with sepsis. 
Multivariate logistic regression analysis revealed that BMI was not an 
independent risk factor for in-hospital mortality in younger adult patients with 
sepsis (underweight: adjusted odds ratio [aOR] 1.72, P = 0.076; overweight: aOR 
0.88, P = 0.437; obesity: aOR 0.93, P = 0.677; and severe obesity: aOR 1.22, 
P = 0.580, with normal weight as the reference).
CONCLUSION: Contrary to findings regarding older patients with sepsis, our 
findings suggest that the obesity paradox does not apply to younger adult 
patients with sepsis.

BACKGROUND: Sepsis-associated encephalopathy (SAE) occurs as a result of 
systemic inflammation caused by sepsis. It has been observed that the majority 
of sepsis patients experience SAE while being treated in the intensive care unit 
(ICU), and a significant number of survivors continue suffering from cognitive 
impairment even after recovering from the illness. The objective of this study 
was to create a predictive nomogram that could be used to identify SAE risk 
factors in patients with ICU sepsis.
METHODS: We conducted a retrospective cohort study using the Medical Information 
Mart for Intensive Care IV (MIMIC-IV) database. We defined SAE as a Glasgow Coma 
Scale (GCS) score of 15 or less, or delirium. The patients were randomly divided 
into training and validation cohorts. We used least absolute shrinkage and 
selection operator (LASSO) regression modeling to optimize feature selection. 
Independent risk factors were determined through a multivariable logistic 
regression analysis, and a prediction model was built. The performance of the 
nomogram was evaluated using various metrics including the area under the 
receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC), calibration plots, 
Hosmer-Lemeshow test, decision curve analysis (DCA), net reclassification 
improvement (NRI), and integrated discrimination improvement (IDI).
RESULTS: Among the 4,476 sepsis patients screened, 2,781 (62.1%) developed SAE. 
In-hospital mortality was higher in the SAE group compared to the non-SAE group 
(9.5% vs. 3.7%, p < 0.001). Several variables were analyzed, including the 
patient's age, gender, BMI on admission, mean arterial pressure, body 
temperature, platelet count, sodium level, and use of midazolam. These variables 
were used to create and validate a nomogram. The nomogram's performance, 
assessed by AUC, NRI, IDI, and DCA, was found to be superior to the conventional 
SOFA score combined with delirium. Calibration plots and the Hosmer-Lemeshow 
test confirmed the accuracy of the nomogram. The enhanced NRI and IDI values 
demonstrated that our scoring system outperformed traditional diagnostic 
approaches. Additionally, the DCA curve indicated the practicality of the 
nomogram in clinical settings.
CONCLUSION: This study successfully identified autonomous risk factors 
associated with the emergence of SAE in sepsis patients and utilized them to 
formulate a predictive model. The outcomes of this investigation have the 
potential to serve as a valuable clinical resource for the timely detection of 
SAE in patients.

Background: Endothelial Activation and Stress Index (EASIX) is a reliable 
alternative biomarker of endothelial dysfunction. Because endothelial activation 
is involved in sepsis pathophysiology, we aimed to investigate the association 
between EASIX and prognosis in septic patients. Methods: Data were extracted 
from the Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care (MIMIC) IV database. EASIX 
scores were calculated using the formula: lactate dehydrogenase (U/L) × 
creatinine (mg/dL)/platelet count (109/L). Patients were grouped into tertiles 
according to log2 transformed EASIX. The primary and secondary outcomes were 
28-day and 90-day mortality. Cox proportional hazards models, Kaplan-Meier 
curves, restricted cubic spline curves, and subgroup analyses were conducted to 
evaluate the association between EASIX and prognosis in septic patients. 
Results: A total of 7504 patients were included. Multivariable Cox proportional 
hazards analyses showed that higher log2-EASIX was associated with increased 
risk of 28-day mortality (HR, 1.10; 95% CI, 1.07-1.13; P < 0.001). Compared with 
tertile 1, the tertile 2 and 3 groups had higher risk of 28-day mortality [HR 
(95% CI) 1.24 (1.09-1.41); HR (95% CI) 1.51 (1.31-1.74)]; P for trend < 0.001). 
Similar results were found for 90-day mortality. Kaplan-Meier curves showed that 
patients with higher EASIX had lower 28-day and 90-day survival rates. A linear 
relationship was found between log2-EASIX and 28-day and 90-day mortality. 
Conclusion: High EASIX was significantly associated with an increased risk of 
28-day and 90-day all-cause mortality in patients with sepsis.

BACKGROUND: There has been considerable controversy between sepsis-1 and 
sepsis-3 criteria.
METHODS: Patients with infection meeting two or more systemic inflammatory 
response syndrome (SIRS) criteria (sepsis-1) or a Sequential Organ Failure 
Assessment (SOFA) score ≥ 2 (sepsis-3) on the first day after ICU admission were 
selected from the Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care-III database, and 
their outcomes were compared using all-cause death as the end point. Subgroup 
analysis was also performed based on prior chronic organ dysfunction.
RESULTS: There were 21,491 infected patients included. Of those meeting the 
diagnostic criteria for sepsis-1, 13.42% did not satisfy sepsis-3 criteria, and 
this population had a 21-day mortality rate of 6.96%. In contrast, 7.00% of the 
patients meeting sepsis-3 criteria did not meet sepsis-1 criteria, and their 
21-day mortality rate was 10.76%. When excluding preexisting organ conditions, 
18.41% of patients with sepsis-1 did not meet sepsis-3 criteria, with a 21-day 
mortality rate of 6.39%, and 6.00% of patients with sepsis-3 did not meet 
sepsis-1 criteria, with a 21-day mortality rate of 9.11%. When two or more SIRS 
criteria or SOFA score ≥ 2 were applied to predict 21-day all-cause mortality in 
infected patients without prior chronic organ dysfunction, the sensitivity was 
96.0% or 91.0%, respectively. Although the areas under the receiver operator 
curve of both SOFA and SIRS criteria could be used for predicting mortality, 
SOFA score represented the severity of the condition, whereas SIRS score 
represented a clinically evident host response to infection.
CONCLUSIONS: Sepsis-3 diagnostic criteria narrow the sepsis population at the 
expense of sensitivity, and the resulting false negatives may delay disease 
diagnosis. It may be inappropriate to compare the prediction performance of SIRS 
and SOFA criteria when sepsis-3 is defined.

BACKGROUND: We aimed to develop an early warning system for real-time sepsis 
prediction in the ICU by machine learning methods, with tools for interpretative 
analysis of the predictions. In particular, we focus on the deployment of the 
system in a target medical center with small historical samples.
METHODS: Light Gradient Boosting Machine (LightGBM) and multilayer perceptron 
(MLP) were trained on Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care (MIMIC-III) 
dataset and then finetuned on the private Historical Database of local Ruijin 
Hospital (HDRJH) using transfer learning technique. The Shapley Additive 
Explanations (SHAP) analysis was employed to characterize the feature importance 
in the prediction inference. Ultimately, the performance of the sepsis 
prediction system was further evaluated in the real-world study in the ICU of 
the target Ruijin Hospital.
RESULTS: The datasets comprised 6891 patients from MIMIC-III, 453 from HDRJH, 
and 67 from Ruijin real-world data. The area under the receiver operating 
characteristic curves (AUCs) for LightGBM and MLP models derived from MIMIC-III 
were 0.98 - 0.98 and 0.95 - 0.96 respectively on MIMIC-III dataset, and, in 
comparison, 0.82 - 0.86 and 0.84 - 0.87 respectively on HDRJH, from 1 to  5 h 
preceding. After transfer learning and ensemble learning, the AUCs of the final 
ensemble model were enhanced to 0.94 - 0.94 on HDRJH and to 0.86 - 0.9 in the 
real-world study in the ICU of the target Ruijin Hospital. In addition, the SHAP 
analysis illustrated the importance of age, antibiotics, net balance, and 
ventilation for sepsis prediction, making the model interpretable.
CONCLUSIONS: Our machine learning model allows accurate real-time prediction of 
sepsis within 5-h preceding. Transfer learning can effectively improve the 
feasibility to deploy the prediction model in the target cohort, and ameliorate 
the model performance for external validation. SHAP analysis indicates that the 
role of antibiotic usage and fluid management needs further investigation. We 
argue that our system and methodology have the potential to improve ICU 
management by helping medical practitioners identify at-sepsis-risk patients and 
prepare for timely diagnosis and intervention.

OBJECTIVES: Septic shock is a common condition necessitating timely management 
including hemodynamic support with vasopressors. Despite the high prevalence and 
mortality, there is limited data characterizing patients who require three or 
more vasopressors. We sought to define the demographics, outcomes, and 
prognostic determinants associated with septic shock requiring three or more 
vasopressors.
DESIGN: This is a multicenter retrospective cohort of two ICU databases, Medical 
Information Mart for Intensive Care IV (MIMIC-IV) and electronic ICU-Clinical 
Research Database, which include over 400,000 patients admitted to 342 ICUs.
PATIENTS: Inclusion criteria entailed patients who were: 1) age 18 years old and 
older, 2) admitted to any ICU, 3) administered at least three vasopressors for 
at least 2 hours at any time during their ICU stay, and 4) identified to have 
sepsis based on the Sepsis-3 criteria.
INTERVENTIONS: None.
MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: A total of 3447 patients met inclusion criteria. 
The median age was 67 years, 60.5% were male, and 96.6% had full code orders at 
the time of the third vasopressor initiation. Septic shock requiring three or 
more vasopressors was associated with 57.6% in-hospital mortality. Code status 
changes occurred in 23.9% of patients following initiation of a third 
vasopressor. Elevated lactate upon ICU admission (odds ratio [95% CI], 2.79 
[2.73-2.85]), increased duration of time between ICU admission and third 
vasopressor initiation (1.78 [1.69-1.87]), increased serum creatinine (1.61 
[1.59-1.62]), and age above 60 years (1.47 [1.41-1.54]) were independently 
associated with an increased risk of mortality based on analysis of the MIMIC-IV 
database. Non-White race and Richmond Agitation-Sedation Scale scores were not 
associated with mortality.
CONCLUSIONS: Septic shock requiring three vasopressors is associated with 
exceptionally high mortality. Knowledge of patients at highest risk of mortality 
in this population may inform management and expectations conveyed in shared 
decision-making.

The mortality rate of patients with sepsis-induced acute kidney injury (S-AKI) 
is notably elevated. The initial categorization of prognostic indicators has a 
beneficial impact on elucidating and enhancing disease outcomes. This study 
aimed to predict the mortality risk of S-AKI patients by employing machine 
learning techniques. The sample size determined by a four-step procedure yielded 
1508 samples. The research design necessitated the inclusion of individuals with 
S-AKI from the Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care (MIMIC)-IV database. 
The patients were initially admitted to the Intensive Care Unit (ICU) for their 
hospital stay. Additionally, these patients (aged from 18 to 89 years old) had 
encountered S-AKI on the day of their admittance. Forty-two predictive factors 
were analyzed, with hospitalization death as the outcome variable. The training 
set (4001 cases) consisted of 70 % of the participants, and the remaining (1714 
cases) participants were allocated to the validation set. Furthermore, an 
additional validation set (MIMIC-III) consisted of 1757 patients from the 
MIMIC-III database. Moreover, an external validation set from the Intensive Care 
Department of Beijing Friendship Hospital (BFH) comprised 72 patients. Six 
machine learning models were employed in the prediction, namely the logistic, 
lasso, rpart, random forest, xgboost, and artificial neural network models. The 
comparative efficacy of the newly developed model in relation to the APACHE II 
model for predicting mortality risk was also assessed. The XGBoost model 
exhibited a superior performance with the training set. With the internal 
validation set and the two external validation sets (MIMIC-III and BFH), the 
xgboost algorithm demonstrated the highest performance. Meanwhile, APACHE II 
performed poorly at predicting the mortality risk with the BFH validation set. 
The mortality risk was influenced by three primary clinical parameters: urine 
volume, lactate, and Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) score. Thus, we developed a 
prediction model for the risk of death among S-AKI patients that has an improved 
performance compared to previous models and is a potentially valuable tool for 
S-AKI prediction and treatment in the clinic.

Background: Sepsis-associated encephalopathy (SAE) is a dysfunction of the 
central nervous system experienced during sepsis with variable clinical and 
pathophysiologic features. We sought to identify distinct SAE phenotypes in 
relation to clinical outcomes. Methods: The Medical Information Mart for 
Intensive Care IV (MIMIC-IV) database and the eICU database were used to conduct 
a retrospective cohort study. Adult sepsis patients were included and SAE was 
defined as having a Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) score ˂15 or delirium. The 
following our clinical phenotypes were defined as: ischemic-hypoxic, metabolic, 
mixed (ischemic-hypoxic and metabolic), and unclassified. The primary outcome 
was in-hospital mortality. Results: The study enrolled 4,120 sepsis patients, 
2,239 from MIMIC-IV (including 1,489 patients with SAE, 67%), and 1,881 from 
eICU (1,291, 69%). For the SAE cohort, 2,780 patients in total were enrolled 
(median age, 67 years; interquartile range, 56-76.8; 1,589 (57%) were male; 
median GCS score was 12 [8-14]; median Sequential Organ Failure Assessment score 
was 6 [4-9]). The SAE phenotype distributions between the MIMIC-IV and eICU 
cohorts were as follows (39% vs. 35% ischemic-hypoxic, P = 0.043; 38% vs. 40% 
metabolic, P = 0.239; 15% vs. 15% mixed, P = 0.972; 38% vs. 40% unclassified, P 
= 0.471). For the overall cohort, the in-hospital mortality for patients with 
ischemic-hypoxic, metabolic, mixed, or unclassified phenotypes was 33.9% (95% 
confidence interval, 0.3-0.37), 28.4% (0.26-0.31), 41.5% (0.37-0.46), and 14.2% 
(0.12-0.16), respectively. In the multivariable logistic analysis, the mixed 
phenotype was associated with the highest risk of in-hospital mortality after 
adjusting for age, sex, GCS, and modified Sequential Organ Failure Assessment 
score (adjusted odds ratio, 2.11; 95% confidence interval, 1.67-2.67; P < 
0.001). Conclusions: Four SAE phenotypes had different clinical outcomes. The 
mixed phenotype had the worst outcomes. Further understanding of these 
phenotypes in sepsis may improve trial design and targeted SAE management.

BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: Acute Kidney Injury (AKI) is a common and severe 
complication in patients diagnosed with sepsis. It is associated with higher 
mortality rates, prolonged hospital stays, increased utilization of medical 
resources, and financial burden on patients' families. This study aimed to 
establish and validate predictive models using machine learning algorithms to 
accurately predict the occurrence of AKI in patients diagnosed with sepsis.
METHODS: This retrospective study utilized real observational data from the 
Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care IV (MIMIC-IV) database. It included 
patients aged 18 to 90 years diagnosed with sepsis who were admitted to the ICU 
for the first time and had hospital stays exceeding 48 hours. Predictive models, 
employing various machine learning algorithms including Light Gradient Boosting 
Machine (LightGBM), EXtreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost), Random Forest (RF), 
Decision Tree (DT), Artificial Neural Network (ANN), Support Vector Machine 
(SVM), and Logistic Regression (LR), were developed. The dataset was randomly 
divided into training and test sets at a ratio of 4:1.
RESULTS: A total of 10,575 sepsis patients were included in the analysis, of 
whom 8,575 (81.1%) developed AKI during hospitalization. A selection of 47 
variables was utilized for model construction. The models derived from LightGBM, 
XGBoost, RF, DT, ANN, SVM, and LR achieved AUCs of 0.801, 0.773, 0.772, 0.737, 
0.720, 0.765, and 0.776, respectively. Among these models, LightGBM demonstrated 
the most superior predictive performance.
CONCLUSIONS: These machine learning models offer valuable predictive 
capabilities for identifying AKI in patients diagnosed with sepsis. The LightGBM 
model, with its superior predictive capability, could aid clinicians in early 
identification of high-risk patients.

Background: This study aimed to investigate whether early unfractionated heparin 
(UFH) administration provides a survival advantage for patients with 
sepsis-induced coagulopathy (SIC). Methods: Patients hospitalized with 
sepsis-induced coagulopathy from the Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care 
(MIMIC)-IV database were identified. Patients were divided into two groups, who 
received unfractionated heparin (UFH) subcutaneously within 24 h after intensive 
care unit (ICU) admission, and the control group, who received not. The primary 
endpoint was intensive care unit mortality, the secondary outcomes were 7, 14, 
and 28-day and hospital mortality. Propensity score matching (PSM) the marginal 
structural Cox model (MSCM) and E-value analysis were used to account for 
baseline differences, time-varying and unmeasured confounding factors. Results: 
A total of 3,377 patients with sepsis-induced coagulopathy were enrolled in the 
study, of which 815 in unfractionated heparin group and 2,562 in control group. 
There was significant effect on primary and secondary outcomes with 
unfractionated heparin after propensity score matching (intensive care unit 
mortality, hazard ratio [HR] 0.69, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.52-0.92; 
7-day, HR 0.70, 95% CI 0.49-0.99; 14-day, HR 0.68.95% CI 0.50-0.92; 28-day, HR 
0.72, 95% CI 0.54-0.96; hospital mortality, HR 0.74, 95% CI 0.57-0.96), marginal 
structural Cox model manifested unfractionated heparin associated with decreased 
intensive care unit mortality in all populations (HR 0.64, 95% CI 0.49-0.84), 
and stratification with the marginal structural Cox model indicated analysis 
further indicated the survival advantage only among patients with an 
sepsis-induced coagulopathy score of 4 (HR 0.56, 95% CI 0.38-0.81). Further 
analysis showed that treatment with 6,250-13750 IU/day of unfractionated heparin 
associated with a decreased risk of intensive care unit mortality. Similar 
results were replicated in subgroup analysis with propensity score matching only 
for patients with an sepsis-induced coagulopathy score of 4 (intensive care unit 
mortality, HR 0.51, 95% CI 0.34-0.76). Conclusion: This study found early 
unfractionated heparin therapy to patients with sepsis-induced coagulopathy 
appears to be associated with improved outcomes. Subgroup analysis further 
demonstrates heparin therapy decreased intensive care unit mortality primarily 
in patients only with SIC score of 4.

Mortality and differential predictive factors of transient and persistent 
sepsis-associated acute kidney injury.

Xia W, Yi F, Wang Q.

BACKGROUND: The clinical outcomes and differential predictive factors for 
transient and persistent sepsis-associated AKI (SA-AKI) currently remain 
unclear. Therefore, using a large international database, this study aimed to 
compare the in-hospital mortality outcomes and determine the clinical factors 
for differentiating transient and persistent SA-AKI.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: Patients with SA-AKI were identified from the Medical 
Information Mart for Intensive Care IV (MIMIC IV) database and divided into a 
persistent SA-AKI group and a transient SA-AKI group. In-hospital mortality 
rates between the two groups were compared. Logistic regression was performed to 
explore the risk factors, with the establishment of a clinical predictive model 
for transient or persistent SA-AKI.
RESULTS: Mortality rate of the persistent SA-AKI group was higher than of the 
transient SA-AKI group (p < 0.001). Persistent SA-AKI was an independent risk 
factor for in-hospital mortality. Factors including creatinine level at 
inclusion (OR 1.49, 95% CI 1.43 - 1.56, p < 0.001), changes of creatinine level 
(mg/dL) within 24 hours (OR 4.25, 95% CI 3.74 - 4.86, p < 0.001), continuous 
renal replacement therapy (CRRT) performed within 48 hours (OR 4.20, 95% CI 
2.87 - 6.17), lactate level (mmol/L) (OR 1.18, 95% CI 1.05 - 1.12, p < 0.001) 
were independent risk factors for persistent SA-AKI. When incorporating these 
factors, the predictive model for persistent SA-AKI demonstrated good C-indexes 
of 0.80 (95% CI: 0.80 - 0.82) and 0.81 (95% CI: 0.79 - 0.83) in the training and 
validation cohorts, respectively, though the goodness-of-fit was poor.
CONCLUSION: Persistent SA-AKI has a higher risk of in-hospital mortality than 
transient SA-AKI, whereby persistent SA-AKI is also an independent predictor of 
in-hospital mortality. The nomogram established by predictive factors can be 
applied in clinical practice to predict persistent SA-AKI.

BACKGROUND: Septic shock is a clinical syndrome characterized by the progression 
of sepsis to a severe stage. Elderly patients with urosepsis in the intensive 
care unit (ICU) are more likely to progress to septic shock. This study aimed to 
establish and validate a nomogram model for predicting the risk of progression 
to septic shock in elderly patients with urosepsis.
METHODS: We extracted data from the Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care 
(MIMIC-IV) and the eICU Collaborative Research Database (eICU-CRD). The MIMIC-IV 
dataset was split into a training set for model development and an internal 
validation set to assess model performance. Further external validation was 
performed using a distinct dataset sourced from the eICU-CRD. Predictors were 
screened using least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) 
regression and multivariable logistic regression analyses. The evaluation of 
model performance included discrimination, calibration, and clinical usefulness.
RESULTS: The study demonstrated that the Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS), white blood 
count (WBC), platelet, blood urea nitrogen (BUN), calcium, albumin, congestive 
heart failure (CHF), and invasive ventilation were closely associated with 
septic shock in the training cohort. Nomogram prediction, utilizing eight 
parameters, demonstrated strong predictive accuracy with area under the curve 
(AUC) values of 0.809 (95 % CI 0.786-0.834), 0.794 (95 % CI 0.756-0.831), and 
0.723 (95 % CI 0.647-0.801) in the training, internal validation, and external 
validation sets, respectively. Additionally, the nomogram demonstrated a 
promising calibration performance and significant clinical usefulness in both 
the training and validation sets.
CONCLUSION: The constructed nomogram is a reliable and practical tool for 
predicting the risk of progression to septic shock in elderly patients with 
urosepsis. Its implementation in clinical practice may enhance the early 
identification of high-risk patients, facilitate timely and targeted 
interventions to mitigate the risk of septic shock, and improve patient 
outcomes.

BackgroundTo develop and validate a mortality prediction model for patients with 
sepsis-associated Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS).MethodsThis 
retrospective cohort study included 2466 patients diagnosed with sepsis and ARDS 
within 24 h of ICU admission. Demographic, clinical, and laboratory parameters 
were extracted from Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care III (MIMIC-III) 
database. Feature selection was performed using the Boruta algorithm, followed 
by the construction of seven ML models: logistic regression, Naive Bayes, 
k-nearest neighbor, support vector machine, decision tree, Random Forest, and 
extreme gradient boosting. Model performance was evaluated using the area under 
the receiver operating characteristic curve, accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, 
positive predictive value, and negative predictive value.ResultsThe study 
identified 24 variables significantly associated with mortality. The optimal ML 
model, a Random Forest model, demonstrated an AUC of 0.8015 in the test set, 
with high accuracy and specificity. The model highlighted the importance of 
blood urea nitrogen, age, urine output, Simplified Acute Physiology Score II, 
and albumin levels in predicting mortality.ConclusionsThe model's superior 
predictive performance underscores the potential for integrating advanced 
analytics into clinical decision-making processes, potentially improving patient 
outcomes and resource allocation in critical care settings.

BACKGROUND: Early detection and efficient management of sepsis are important for 
improving health care quality, effectiveness, and costs. Due to its high cost 
and prevalence, sepsis is a major focus area across institutions and many 
studies have emerged over the past years with different models or novel machine 
learning techniques in early detection of sepsis or potential mortality 
associated with sepsis.
OBJECTIVE: To understand predictive analytics solutions for sepsis patients, 
either in early detection of onset or mortality.
METHODS AND RESULTS: We performed a systematized narrative review and identified 
common and unique characteristics between their approaches and results in 
studies that used predictive analytics solutions for sepsis patients. After 
reviewing 148 retrieved papers, a total of 31 qualifying papers were analyzed 
with variances in model, including linear regression (n = 2), logistic 
regression (n = 5), support vector machines (n = 4), and Markov models (n = 4), 
as well as population (range: 24-198,833) and feature size (range: 2-285). Many 
of the studies used local data sets of varying sizes and locations while others 
used the publicly available Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care data. 
Additionally, vital signs or laboratory test results were commonly used as 
features for training and testing purposes; however, a few used more unique 
features including gene expression data from blood plasma and unstructured text 
and data from clinician notes.
CONCLUSION: Overall, we found variation in the domain of predictive analytics 
tools for septic patients, from feature and population size to choice of method 
or algorithm. There are still limitations in transferability and 
generalizability of the algorithms or methods used. However, it is evident that 
implementing predictive analytics tools are beneficial in the early detection of 
sepsis or death related to sepsis. Since most of these studies were 
retrospective, the translational value in the real-world setting in different 
wards should be further investigated.

Objective: Patients with sepsis often experience reductions or increases in 
platelet counts, but the implications of these temporal patterns on prognosis 
remain unclear. The aim of this study was to investigate the impact of changes 
in platelet trajectories on the clinical prognosis of sepsis. Methods: This 
study was a retrospective analysis using data from the Medical Information Mart 
for Intensive Care IV database. Patients with sepsis were identified from the 
database, and their platelet trajectories were categorized into four distinct 
models based on the changes in platelet counts over a period of 14 days after 
diagnosis of sepsis. The effect of these trajectories on patient prognosis was 
subsequently evaluated. Results: A total of 15,250 patients with sepsis were 
included to construct a model, and the following four distinct platelet count 
trajectories were identified: normal platelet levels (phenotype 1); persistently 
low platelet levels (phenotype 2); gradually increasing platelet levels 
exceeding the normal range (phenotype 3); and consistently significantly 
elevated platelet levels (phenotype 4). Statistically significant differences 
were found in the 28-day mortality, in-hospital mortality, and 90-day mortality 
among the four phenotypes. Multivariate regression analysis showed that compared 
to the group with normal platelet levels (phenotype 1), the group with 
persistently low platelet levels (phenotype 2) had higher in-hospital mortality 
(odds ratio [OR] = 1.34, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.16-1.54), 28-day 
mortality (OR = 1.69, 95% CI: 1.47-1.94), and 90-day mortality (OR = 1.50, 95% 
CI: 1.32-1.69). There was no difference in in-hospital mortality between 
phenotypes 3 and 4 compared to phenotype 1, although phenotype 4 showed an 
increase in 28-day mortality ( P < 0.05), and phenotype 3 showed a decreasing 
trend in 90-day mortality ( P < 0.05). The results of inverse probability 
weighting adjusted by regression were basically consistent with the above 
findings, except that there was no statistical difference in 28-day mortality 
between phenotype 4 and phenotype 1. In the subgroups based on age, weight, and 
antiplatelet drugs or therapies, there was an interaction between platelet 
levels and these factors. Conclusions: In patients with sepsis, a decrease in 
platelet count is associated with increased mortality, while a moderate increase 
in platelet count can reduce 90-day mortality. However, for patients with 
persistently elevated platelet counts, caution is advised when using 
antiplatelet drugs or therapies, as it may increase mortality.

OBJECTIVE: A decrease in platelet count has been reported to be associated with 
several neonatal inflammatory diseases, including sepsis and necrotizing 
enterocolitis; while its association with neonatal acute kidney injury (AKI) has 
not been reported. This study aims to explore the association between platelet 
count and neonatal AKI.
METHODS: This was a retrospective cohort study based on the Medical Information 
Mart for Intensive Care III (MIMIC-III) database. Data were extracted based on 
baseline characteristics, comorbidities, vital signs, laboratory parameters, and 
intervention measures. Logistic regression analysis was used to assess the 
association between platelet count and AKI, and results were shown as odds 
ratios (OR) with 95% confidence intervals (CI).
RESULTS: A total of 1,576 neonates were finally included in the analysis. After 
adjusting birth weight, sepsis, patent ductus arteriosus, hematocrit, percentage 
of neutrophils, and vasopressor use, we found that platelet count in the lowest 
quartile (Q1) was significantly associated with the higher odds of AKI than 
platelet count in the highest quartile (Q4) (OR = 1.70, 95% CI: 1.01-2.87).
CONCLUSIONS: Low platelet count was associated with the high odds of AKI in the 
neonatal intensive care unit (NICU), indicating that platelet count might be a 
biomarker for neonatal AKI. Large-scale multicenter studies should be performed 
to verify the results.

OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to evaluate the association between the Endothelial 
Activation and Stress Index (EASIX) and 30-day mortality risk in acute 
myocardial infarction (AMI) patients.
METHODS: Using a retrospective cohort design, data were extracted from the 
Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care-IV (MIMIC-IV) database between 2008 
and 2019. Patients diagnosed with AMI at intensive care unit (ICU) admission 
were included. EASIX score was calculated as follows: lactate dehydrogenase 
(LDH) level (U/L) × creatinine level (mg/dL)/platelet count (109/L). Cox 
regression models assessed the association between EASIX and 30-day mortality, 
with subgroup analyses based on age, gender, AMI subtype, and sepsis status.
RESULTS: A total of 1,036 patients were analyzed, among whom 323 did not survive 
beyond 30 days post-ICU admission. Higher EASIX scores were associated with 
increased 30-day mortality in AMI patients [Hazard ratio (HR): 1.70, 95% 
confidence interval (CI): 1.17-2.46, P = 0.005). Subgroup analyses supported 
these findings and revealed significant interactions between EASIX and variables 
such as gender and AMI subtype (P < 0.05).
CONCLUSION: Elevated EASIX scores are significantly correlated with increased 
30-day mortality risk in AMI patients, suggesting EASIX as a valuable prognostic 
tool that may inform clinical management strategies to improve outcomes in AMI.

INTRODUCTION: The prognostic value of D-dimer (DD) in sepsis remains 
controversial. This study aimed to investigate the performance of DD for 
predicting sepsis mortality in the hospital and for identifying its potential 
correlates.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: The clinical and laboratory data of adult sepsis patients 
were extracted from the Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care III (MIMIC 
III, v1.4) database using the structured query language (SQL). The database 
contains critical illness admitted to the intensive care unit at Beth Israel 
Deaconess Medical Center between June 2001 and October 2012. The association 
between DD and mortality was investigated with receiver operating characteristic 
(ROC) curve, restricted cubic spline and logistic regression analysis. Subgroup 
analysis was also used for identifying DD correlates.
RESULTS: The study population consisted of 358 sepsis patients. Those who died 
during hospital stay (N = 160) had significantly higher DD values than those who 
survived (N = 198). The area under the ROC curve (AUC) of DD was 0.59 (P < 
0.010). In subgroup analysis, white blood cell (WBC) count > 18 x109/L and 
vasopressor therapy significantly decreased DD diagnostic performance. 
Categorical DD value was independently associated with hospital mortality after 
sequential organ failure score (SOFA) and blood lactate adjustment. Restricted 
cubic spline analysis revealed a U-shape relationship between DD and in-hospital 
mortality.
DISCUSSION: We conclude that the accuracy of DD for predicting in-hospital 
sepsis mortality depends on WBC count and vasopressor therapy. Both low and 
extremely elevated DD values are associated with higher risk of death.

Background: Urinary tract infection (UTI) is one of the common causes of sepsis. 
However, nomograms predicting the sepsis risk in UTI patients have not been 
comprehensively researched. The goal of this study was to establish and validate 
a nomogram to predict the probability of sepsis in UTI patients. Methods: 
Patients diagnosed with UTI were extracted from the Medical Information Mart for 
Intensive Care III database. These patients were randomly divided into training 
and validation cohorts. Independent prognostic factors for UTI patients were 
determined using forward stepwise logistic regression. A nomogram containing 
these factors was established to predict the sepsis incidence in UTI patients. 
The validity of our nomogram model was determined using multiple indicators, 
including the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC), 
correction curve, Hosmer-Lemeshow test, integrated discrimination improvement 
(IDI), net reclassification improvement (NRI), and decision-curve analysis 
(DCA). Results: This study included 6,551 UTI patients. Stepwise regression 
analysis revealed that the independent risk factors for sepsis in UTI patients 
were congestive heart failure, diabetes, liver disease, fluid electrolyte 
disorders, APSIII, neutrophils, lymphocytes, red blood cell distribution width, 
urinary protein, urinary blood, and microorganisms. The nomogram was then 
constructed and validated. The AUC, NRI, IDI and DCA of the nomogram all showed 
better performance than traditional APSIII score. The calibration curve and 
Hosmer-Lemeshow test results indicate that the nomogram was well-calibrated. 
Improved NRI and IDI values indicate that our nomogram scoring system is 
superior to other commonly used ICU scoring systems. The DCA curve indicates 
that the DCA map of the nomogram has good clinical application ability. 
Conclusion: This study identified the independent risk factors of sepsis in UTI 
patients and used them to construct a prediction model. The present findings may 
provide clinical reference information for preventing sepsis in UTI patients.

Sepsis-associated thrombocytopenia (SAT) is a common complication in the 
intensive care unit (ICU), which significantly increases the mortality rate and 
leads to poor prognosis of diseases. Machine learning (ML) is widely used in 
disease prediction in critically ill patients. Here, we aimed to establish 
prediction models for platelet decrease and severe platelet decrease in ICU 
patients with sepsis based on four common ML algorithms and identify the best 
prediction model. The research subjects were 1,455 ICU sepsis patients admitted 
to Dongyang People's Hospital affiliated with Wenzhou Medical University from 
January 1, 2015, to October 31, 2019. Basic clinical demographic information, 
biochemical indicators, and clinical outcomes were recorded. The prediction 
models were based on four ML algorithms: random forest, neural network, gradient 
boosting machine, and Bayesian algorithms. Thrombocytopenia was found to occur 
in 732 patients (49.7%). The mechanical ventilation time and length of ICU stay 
were longer, and the mortality rate was higher for the thrombocytopenia group 
than for the non-thrombocytopenia group. The models were validated on an online 
international database (Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care III). The 
areas under the receiver operating characteristic curves (AUCs) of the four 
models for the prediction of thrombocytopenia were between 0.54 and 0.72. The 
AUCs of the models for the prediction of severe thrombocytopenia were between 
0.70 and 0.77. The neural network and gradient boosting machine models 
effectively predicted the occurrence of SAT, and the Bayesian models had the 
best performance in predicting severe thrombocytopenia. Therefore, these models 
can be used to identify such high-risk patients at an early stage and guide 
individualized clinical treatment, to improve the prognosis of diseases.

BACKGROUND: Fluid resuscitation is necessary to correct the sepsis-induced 
hypoperfusion, which is contradictory to the treatment of heart failure. This 
study explored the association between fluid balance (FB) of the first 24 h 
after ICU admission and mortality in critically ill patients with heart failure 
and sepsis.
METHODS: Data were extracted from the Medical Information Mart for Intensive 
Care database. The locally weighted scatterplot smoothing (Lowess) method was 
used to demonstrate the relationship between FB and in-hospital mortality. 
Groups were divided into high FB (≥ 55.85 ml/kg) and low FB (< 55.85 ml/kg) 
according to the cut-off value of FB using Receiver operating characteristic 
analysis and Youden index method. The primary outcome was in-hospital mortality. 
Subgroup analyses, multivariable logistic regression analyses, and Kaplan-Meier 
curves were used to detect the association and survival difference between 
groups. Inverse probability treatment weighting (IPTW) and propensity score 
matching (PSM) were performed to minimize the bias of confounding factors and 
facilitate the comparability between groups.
RESULTS: A total of 936 patients were included. The Lowess curve showed an 
approximate positive linear relationship for FB and in-hospital mortality. In 
the multivariable logistic regression adjusted model, high FB showed strong 
associations with in-hospital mortality (OR 2.53, 95% CI 1.60-3.99, p < 0.001) 
as compared to the low FB group. In IPTW and PSM models, high FB consistently 
showed higher in-hospital mortality (IPTW model: OR 1.94, 95% CI 1.52-2.49, 
p < 0.001; PSM model: OR 2.93, 95% CI 1.75-4.90, p < 0.001) and 30-day mortality 
(IPTW model: OR 1.65, 95% CI 1.29-2.10, p < 0.001; PSM model: OR 2.50, 95% CI 
1.51-4.15, p < 0.001), compared with the low FB group.
CONCLUSION: For critically ill patients with heart failure and sepsis, high FB 
within the first 24 h after ICU admission could serve as an independent risk 
factor for in-hospital mortality and 30-day mortality. The avoidance of fluid 
overload exerts important effects on reducing mortality in such patients.

Sepsis is a serious complication of liver cirrhosis. This study aimed to develop 
a risk prediction model for sepsis among patients with liver cirrhosis. A total 
of 3130 patients with liver cirrhosis were enrolled from the Medical Information 
Mart for Intensive Care IV database, and randomly assigned into training and 
validation cohorts in a 7:3 ratio. The least absolute shrinkage and selection 
operator (LASSO) regression was used to filter variables and select predictor 
variables. Multivariate logistic regression was used to establish the prediction 
model. Based on LASSO and multivariate logistic regression, gender, base excess, 
bicarbonate, white blood cells, potassium, fibrinogen, systolic blood pressure, 
mechanical ventilation, and vasopressor use were identified as independent risk 
variables, and then a nomogram was constructed and validated. The consistency 
index (C-index), receiver operating characteristic curve, calibration curve, and 
decision curve analysis (DCA) were used to measure the predictive performance of 
the nomogram. As a result of the nomogram, good discrimination was achieved, 
with C-indexes of 0.814 and 0.828 for the training and validation cohorts, 
respectively, and an area under the curve of 0.849 in the training cohort and 
0.821 in the validation cohort. The calibration curves demonstrated good 
agreement between the predictions and observations. The DCA curves showed the 
nomogram had significant clinical value. We developed and validated a 
risk-prediction model for sepsis in patients with liver cirrhosis. This model 
can assist clinicians in the early detection and prevention of sepsis in 
patients with liver cirrhosis.

Triglyceride-glucose (TyG) index has emerged as a novel biomarker for detecting 
insulin resistance (IR) and has been proven to be associated with various 
diseases. However, its correlation with the prognosis of severe sepsis remains 
unraveled. This retrospective cohort study utilized patient records from the 
Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care (MIMIC-IV, version 2.2) to examine 
the outcomes of patients with sepsis. The primary outcomes were hospital 
mortality and intensive care unit (ICU) mortality. The correlation between the 
TyG index and outcomes was evaluated through the Kaplan-Meier method, the 
Log-rank test, and univariate and multivariate Cox regression analyses. 
Additionally, restricted cubic spline (RCS) regression analysis was employed to 
delve into the nonlinear relationship between baseline TyG index and outcomes, 
with trend significance assessed through quartile levels. Subgroup analyses were 
conducted to evaluate the consistency of the TyG index's prognostic value across 
various influencing factors. The study included 1,742 patients with sepsis 
requiring intensive care. The in-hospital mortality rate was 19.75% (344/1,742), 
and the ICU mortality rate was 14.75% (257/1,742). Cox regression analysis 
revealed that, in comparison to the first quartile (Q1), patients in the fourth 
quartile (Q4) had a 63% higher risk of in-hospital mortality (HR 1.63 [95% CI 
1.22 to 2.18], P < 0.01) and a 79% higher risk of ICU mortality (HR 1.79 [95% CI 
1.28 to 2.51], P < 0.001). Model 3 showed that ICU mortality risks for Q4, Q3, 
and Q2 were 240%, 75%, and 33% higher, respectively (HR 3.40 [95% CI 2.24 to 
5.16], P < 0.001; HR 1.75 [95% CI 1.16 to 2.63], P = 0.007; HR 1.33 [95% CI 1.20 
to 1.53], P < 0.001). RCS regression analysis identified a nonlinear association 
between the TyG index and mortality (overall P < 0.001; P for 
nonlinearity < 0.001, with an inflection point at 8.9). Subgroup analysis showed 
that the effect size and direction were consistent across different subgroups, 
suggesting the stability of the results. This study demonstrates that a higher 
TyG index is significantly associated with increased in-hospital and ICU 
mortality risk in critically ill sepsis patients, with evidence of non-linear 
correlation. Therefore, the TyG index helps identify the mortality prognosis of 
sepsis patients in the ICU.

The occurrence of sepsis-associated acute kidney injury (SA-AKI) predicts a 
worse prognosis. We aimed to assess the impact of acetaminophen use on 
short-term mortality in patients with SA-AKI. A total of 6563 patients diagnosed 
with SA-AKI from the 2008 to 2019 Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care IV 
(MIMIC-IV) database were enrolled in this retrospective cohort study. The Cox 
regression model was utilized to analyze the associations of acetaminophen with 
30-day mortality and in-hospital mortality. Additional propensity score matching 
(PSM) analysis was performed regarding patients with acetaminophen use versus 
those without. Of these patients, 30-day mortality occurred in 1421 (21.65%) 
patients and in-hospital mortality in 1246 (18.99%) patients. Patients who used 
acetaminophen were associated with a reduced risk of 30-day mortality (hazard 
ratio (HR) = 0.80, 95% confidence interval (CI): 0.71-0.90) and in-hospital 
mortality (HR = 0.72, 95% CI: 0.63-0.82). The PSM analysis demonstrated that 
acetaminophen use was still related to a reduced risk of 30-day mortality and 
in-hospital mortality. Subgroup analysis showed that the relationships between 
acetaminophen and 30-day mortality and in-hospital mortality were consistent 
across subgroups (p < 0.05). The use of acetaminophen has an association with 
lower short-term mortality in patients with SA-AKI.

Coronary heart disease (CHD) is a common comorbidity in intensive care unit 
(ICU) patients, particularly in the elderly. This particular population may have 
worse conditions during sepsis, and it presents an overwhelming challenge for 
clinical practice. Previous studies suggested that patients with CHD have an 
increased risk of cardiovascular events, and low albumin concentration worsens 
the prognosis of patients with stable CHD. Hypoalbuminemia in patients with 
sepsis is common due to nutritional disorders, excessive consumption, and 
leakage. Albumin is a fluid often used for resuscitation in patients with 
sepsis. However, albumin infusion in patients with sepsis and CHD has rarely 
been studied. The effects and safety of albumin infusion in patients with sepsis 
and CHD remain unclear. Therefore, we collected medical information from 
Mimic-III (Mimic-III) and compared the all-cause mortality and cardiovascular 
mortality at 28- or 90-day between the albumin and non-albumin groups in septic 
patients with CHD. A total of 2,027 patients with sepsis and CHD were included 
in our study, with 405 in the albumin group and 1,622 in the non-albumin group. 
After propensity score matching (PSM), 350 pairs were included in our study. 
Improved survival benefits were found in the albumin group at the 28-day 
all-cause mortality compared with the non-albumin group (hazard ratio [HR], 
0.54; 95% CI: 0.38-0.78; p = 0.0009). However, no difference was detected in the 
90-day survival benefits (HR, 0.80, 95% CI: 0.60-1.06, p = 0.1207). Albumin 
infusion did not reverse cardiovascular mortality neither at 28th day nor at 
90th day (cardiovascular mortality: 28 days, HR, 0.52, 95% CI: 0.23-1.19, p = 
0.1218; 90 days, HR, 0.66, 95% CI: 0.33-1.33, p = 0.2420).

Objective: The causality between cardiometabolic disease (CMD) and sepsis has 
remained largely unknown. To elucidate this, we conducted a Mendelian 
randomization (MR) and population study. Methods: First, we used univariable and 
multivariable MR analyses to investigate causal associations between CMD and 
sepsis-related outcomes. We obtained genome-wide association study summary from 
both the MRC Integrative Epidemiology Unit and the FinnGen consortium. 
Subsequently, a two-step mediation MR analysis was performed to explore 
mediators. Afterward, we conducted an observational study using the Medical 
Information Mart for Intensive Care IV database, in which multivariable logistic 
regression models were utilized to examine the relationship between CMD and 
sepsis-related outcomes. Results: In the MR study, type 2 diabetes mellitus (OR 
= 1.058, 95% CI = 1.017-1.100, P = 0.005), obesity (OR = 1.113, 95% CI = 
1.057-1.172, P < 0.001), and heart failure (HF) (OR = 1.178, 95% CI = 
1.063-1.305, P = 0.002) were independently causally related to sepsis. Obesity 
(OR = 1.215, 95% CI = 1.027-1.437, P = 0.023) and HF (OR = 1.494, 95% CI = 
1.080-2.065, P = 0.015) also showed independent causal associations with sepsis 
critical care admission. Mediation MR analysis identified 23 blood metabolites 
potentially causally linked to sepsis ( P < 0.05), yet none mediated the 
relationship between CMD and sepsis. In the observational study, we found 
associations between sepsis and several conditions including type 2 diabetes 
mellitus, obesity, hypertension, stroke, HF, and hyperlipidemia after adjusting 
for confounding factors. Moreover, hypertension, stroke, HF, coronary artery 
disease, and hyperlipidemia were linked to sepsis critical care admission. 
Conclusion: This study has, for the first time, revealed indicative evidence of 
a causal relationship between CMD and sepsis through observational and genetic 
evidence. Taken together, clinical attention to sepsis may be warranted among 
patients with CMD.

BACKGROUND: Sepsis is a life-threatening disease with high morbidity and 
mortality, characterized by an inadequate systemic immune response to an initial 
stimulus. Whether the use of ondansetron (OND) during intensive care unit (ICU) 
stay is associated with the prognosis of sepsis patients remains unclear.
METHODS: Critically ill patients with sepsis were extracted from the Medical 
Information Mart for Intensive Care IV (MIMIC-IV) database. Multivariate 
logistic regression and Cox regression analyses were used to explore the 
association between OND use and clinical outcomes after adjusting for 
confounders. Kaplan-Meier survival curve was used for survival analysis. 
Propensity score matching (PSM) and subgroup analysis were performed to further 
confirm the results.
RESULTS: The OND-medication group showed reduced in-hospital mortality, 28-day 
and 90-day mortalities. The OR for in-hospital mortality was 0.80 (0.64-0.99) 
and HRs for 28-day mortality and 90-day mortality were 0.77 (0.64-0.92) and 0.83 
(0.70-0.98), respectively. After PSM, the clinical outcomes remained consistent. 
In-hospital mortality was lower in the OND-medication group (28.1% vs. 35.8%, P= 
0.044), as well as 28-day mortality (23.4% vs. 32.1%, P=0.022) and 90-day 
mortality (27.4% vs. 35.8%, P=0.035). The protective effect of OND in sepsis 
patients was relatively robust, independent of age, septic shock, vasopressin 
and mechanical ventilation. Additionally, the OND users had longer lengths of 
stay in ICU (6.9(3.1-13.2) vs. 5.1(2.5-11.0), P = 0.026) while no statistical 
differences were found in lengths of stay in hospital (P = 0.333).
CONCLUSION: OND exposure might be associated with lower in-hospital, 28-day, and 
90-day mortality rates in critically ill patients with sepsis. This study 
indicated that OND might help improve the prognosis of patients with sepsis.

BACKGROUND: The triglyceride-glucose (TyG) index and stress hyperglycemia ratio 
(SHR) have been linked to the cardiovascular risks in critical ill patients. 
However, little is known about the predictive power of the TyG index, SHR and 
their combination on the incidence and mortality risks of new-onset atrial 
fibrillation (NOAF) in patients with sepsis.
METHOD: This retrospective study included patients from the Medical Information 
Mart for Intensive Care (MIMIC)-IV database. Primary outcomes were defined as 
the incidence and 360-day mortality of in-hospital NOAF among patients with 
sepsis. Logistic model, Cox proportional hazard model, Kaplan-Meier analysis and 
receiver-operating characteristic (ROC) were performed to explore the 
association between the indices and clinical outcomes. Machine learning approach 
also was constructed to evaluate and compare the indices in predicting mortality 
risks.
RESULTS: 4276 patients meeting the inclusion criteria were enrolled and 764 
individuals developed NOAF during hospitalization. The multivariable adjusted 
odds ratios (95%, CI) of incidence of NOAF in patients with sepsis in the 
highest group versus the lowest group were 1.36 (1.10-1.69), 1.35 (1.09-1.67) 
and 1.58 (1.23-2.02), respectively, for the TyG index, SHR and the TyG index-SHR 
combination. However, the predictive powers of these indices were relatively 
low. Among septic patients who developed in-hospital NOAF, those in the highest 
TyG index group and the highest SHR group exhibited an increased risk of 360-day 
mortality compared with those with the lowest TyG index and the lowest SHR (the 
TyG index: hazard ratio [HR] 1.59, 95% CI 1.00-2.62; SHR: HR 1.67, 95% CI 
1.03-2.70). Patients with both the highest the TyG index and the highest SHR 
demonstrated the highest risk of 360-day mortality (HR 1.72, 95% CI 1.08-2.72). 
The ROC also confirmed the TyG index-SHR combination had more robust predictive 
power for 360-day mortality among septic patients with NOAF than the TyG index 
and SHR itself (p < 0.05). The random forest model validated that the predictive 
capability was significantly enhanced with the integration of the TyG index and 
SHR.
CONCLUSION: The TyG index and SHR were associated with the incidence of 
in-hospital NOAF during sepsis, although their predictive powers were limited. 
In septic patients with in-hospital NOAF, high levels of the TyG index and SHR 
were significantly associated with increased 360-day mortality risks, with their 
combination demonstrating superior predictive power. Joint assessments of the 
TyG index and SHR could help identify individuals at high risks of mortality 
post-discharge, enabling clinicians to prioritize follow-up care and improve 
patient management.

BACKGROUND: The lactate to hematocrit ratio (LHR) has not been assessed for 
predicting all-cause death in sepsis patients. This study aims to evaluate the 
relationship between LHR and 30-day all-cause mortality in sepsis patients.
METHODS: This retrospective study used the data from Medical information mart 
for intensive care IV (MIMIC-IV, version 2.0). Our study focused on adult sepsis 
patients who were initially hospitalized in the Intensive care unit (ICU). The 
prognostic significance of admission LHR for 30-day all-cause mortality was 
evaluated using a multivariate Cox regression model, ROC curve analysis, 
Kaplan-Meier curves, and subgroup analyses.
RESULTS: A total of 3,829 sepsis patients participated in this study. Among the 
cohort, 8.5% of individuals died within of 30 days (p < 0.001). The area under 
the curve (AUC) for LHR was 74.50% (95% CI: 71.6-77.50%), higher than arterial 
blood lactate (AUC = 71.30%), hematocrit (AUC = 64.80%), and shows no 
significant disadvantage compared to qSOFA, SOFA, and SAPS II. We further 
evaluated combining LHR with qSOFA score to predict mortality in sepsis 
patients, which shows more clinical significance. ROC curve analysis showed that 
6.538 was the optimal cutoff value for survival and non-survival groups. With 
LHR ≥6.538 vs. LHR <6.538 (p < 0.001). Subgroup analysis showed significant 
interactions between LHR, age, sex, and simultaneous acute respiratory failure 
(p = 0.001-0.005).
CONCLUSION: LHR is an independent predictor of all-cause mortality in sepsis 
patients after admission, with superior predictive ability compared to blood 
lactate or hematocrit alone.

OBJECTIVE: The goal of the research is to investigate the link between serum 
potassium levels and death after 28 days in sepsis patients, utilizing an 
extensive sample of patients from the multi-center Medical Information Mart for 
Intensive Care IV (MIMIC-IV) database. Current research on serum potassium 
levels and 28-day mortality in sepsis patients is questionable. This study adds 
to the growing body of evidence linking serum potassium levels to the 28-day 
possibility of death in patients with sepsis.
METHODS: We collected 349,08 patients with sepsis from the retrospective cohort 
MIMIC-IV database, using serum potassium level on the first day of admission to 
the intensive care unit as the exposure variable and mortality at 28 days as the 
outcome variable. And controlled for confounding characteristics including 
gender, age, ethnicity, and vital signs during admission.
RESULTS: Serum potassium has a U-shaped connection with 28-day mortality in 
patients suffering from sepsis. The turning point was 4.10 mmol/L (95 % 
confidence interval: 4.03 to 4.22). Serum potassium and 28-day mortality were 
negatively linked on the inflection point's left side (OR: 0.72; 95 % CI: 0.63 
to 0.83, P < 0.0001); on the opposing side of the point of inflexion, serum 
potassium was enthusiastically attached to 28-day mortality. (OR: 1.13; 95 % CI: 
1.06 to 1.21, P < 0.0001).
CONCLUSION: The research conducted found that too high or too low potassium 
levels were linked to a 28-day risk of mortality in humans with sepsis.

BACKGROUND: Heart rate is crucial for patients with septic shock, but there are 
few studies on the scope of heart rate. Therefore, we studied the relationship 
between different heart rates and mortality of critically ill patients with 
septic shock, and explored the optimal heart rate range, in order to provide new 
insights for clinical treatment of septic shock.
METHODS: This retrospective study utilized time-series heart rate data from the 
Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care (MIMIC) IV database. Patients with 
septic shock were identified as the Sepsis 3.0 criteria and received vasopressor 
therapy in the first 24 h since ICU admission. We calculated the time-weighted 
average heart rate (TWA-HR) based on the time-series data. The restricted cubic 
spline (RCS) analysis was employed to investigate the nonlinear relationship 
between heart rate and 28-day mortality, aiming to explore the optimal heart 
rate control target for septic patients and using this target as the exposure 
factor. The primary outcome was 28-day mortality, and the secondary outcome were 
ICU and in-hospital mortality. For the original cohort, we applied the log-rank 
test to infer the relationship between heart rate and mortality. To control for 
bias introduced by confounders, we utilized propensity score matching (PSM) to 
reduce imbalances between normal TWA-HR and high TWA-HR groups, and we 
established a series of models [the multivariable Cox model, matching weight 
(MW)-adjusted Cox model, multivariable logistic regression, MW-adjusted logistic 
regression, and doubly robust model] as sensitivity analyses and subgroup 
analyses to demonstrate the robustness of our findings.
RESULTS: A total of 13492 patients were included in our study. The RCS analysis 
based on Cox and logistic regression showed increased risk of mortality 
(P < 0.001, non-linear P < 0.001) when TWA-HR > 85 beats per minute (bpm). The 
log-rank test revealed in terms of the 28-day mortality, the hazard ratio (HR) 
(95% confidence interval [CI]) was 1.92 (1.78-2.06, P < 0.001) for patients with 
high TWA-HR compared to normal TWA-HR group. Similarly, for the ICU mortality, 
the HR (95% CI) was 1.64 (1.52-1.78, P < 0.001), and for the in-hospital 
mortality, the HR (95% CI) was 1.61 (1.48-1.76, P < 0.001). Collectively, the 
sensitivity analysis consistently demonstrated higher 28-day mortality, ICU 
mortality, and in-hospital mortality in patients with TWA-HR > 85 bpm.
CONCLUSION: Patients with septic shock whose heart rate was controlled no more 
than 85 bpm during ICU stay received survival benefit in terms of 28-day, ICU 
and in-hospital mortality. .

INTRODUCTION: Acute pulmonary embolism (APE) is a life-threatening medical 
condition that is frequently encountered and associated with significant 
incidence and mortality rates, posing a substantial threat to patients' 
well-being and quality of life. Sepsis is prominent independent risk factor for 
the development of APE. Despite recent investigations indicating a reduced APE 
risk through statin therapy, its impact on patients with sepsis and APE remains 
unresolved.
METHODS: The Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care (MIMIC)-IV database was 
utilized to identify patients diagnosed with sepsis and APE, irrespective of 
statin treatment status, as part of this study. The primary study aim was to 
assess the risk of APE, which was analyzed using multivariate logistic 
regression models.
RESULTS: The study encompassed a total of 16,633 participants, with an average 
age of 64.8 ± 16.2 years. Multivariate logistic regression revealed that septic 
patients receiving statin therapy in the intensive care unit (ICU) exhibited a 
33% reduction in the risk of developing APE (OR = 0.67, 95% CI: 0.52-0.86, p 
< 0.001). The findings of further analyses, including stratification based on 
statin usage, dosage, and propensity score matching, consistently reinforced the 
hypothesis that administering statins to patients with sepsis effectively 
mitigates their potential APE risk.
DISCUSSION: The results of the study provide compelling evidence in favor of 
administering statins to septic patients as a prophylactic measure against APE, 
given that statins may reduce the risk of developing APE, and their anti-APE 
effect appears to be dose-dependent. Nonetheless, future randomized controlled 
trials are needed to validate these results.

BACKGROUND: Sepsis is marked by a dysregulated immune response to infection. 
Calcineurin inhibitors (CNIs), commonly used as immunosuppressants, have unique 
properties that may help mitigate the overactive immune response in sepsis, 
potentially leading to better patient outcomes. This study aims to assess 
whether CNIs improve prognosis in septic patients and to evaluate any associated 
adverse reactions.
METHODS: We utilized the Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care IV 2.2 
(MIMIC-IV 2.2) database to identify septic patients who were treated with CNIs 
and those who were not. Propensity score matching (PSM) was employed to balance 
baseline characteristics between the CNI user group and the non-user group. The 
primary outcome was 28-day mortality, analyzed using the Kaplan-Meier method and 
Cox proportional hazard regression models to examine the relationship between 
CNI use and patient survival.
RESULTS: From the MIMIC-IV database, 22,517 septic patients were identified. 
After propensity score matching, a sample of 874 patients was analyzed. The CNI 
group exhibited a significantly lower 28-day mortality risk compared to the 
non-user group (HR: 0.26; 95% CI: 0.17, 0.41) in the univariate Cox hazard 
analysis. Kaplan-Meier survival curves also demonstrated a significantly higher 
28- and 365-day survival rate for CNI users compared to non-users (log-rank test 
p-value = 0.001). No significant association was found between CNI use and an 
increased risk of new-onset infection (p = 0.144), but an association with mild 
hypertension (P < 0.001) and liver injury (P < 0.001) was observed.
CONCLUSION: The use of calcineurin inhibitors was associated with reduced short- 
and long-term mortality in septic patients without an increased incidence of 
new-onset infections, hyperkalemia, severe hypertension, or acute kidney injury 
(AKI). However, CNI use may lead to adverse effects, such as liver injury and 
mild hypertension.

BACKGROUND: Sepsis is a significant contributor to both intensive care unit 
(ICU) admissions and mortality among patients in ICU, with a rising prevalence 
of obesity. There is a lack of extensive research on the correlation between 
TyGI and findings in patients with sepsis, especially in obese patients.
METHODS: This study used a retrospective cohort design and included patients 
with sepsis (≥18 years) from the Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care IV 
database. The association between TyGI and outcome was examined using 
multivariable logistic regression analysis.
RESULTS: 8,840 patients with sepsis were included in the analysis. The in-ICU 
mortality rate was 9.7%. Non-survivors exhibited significantly greater TyGI 
levels than survivors [9.19(8.76-9.71) vs. 9.10(8.67-9.54), p < 0.001]. The 
adjusted multivariate regression model showed that elevated TyGI values were 
linked to a greater likelihood of death in ICU (odds ratio [OR] range 
1.072-1.793, p < 0.001) and hospital (OR range 1.068-1.445, p = 0.005). 
Restricted Cubic Spline analysis revealed a nonlinear association between TyGI 
and in-ICU and in-hospital mortality risks within specified ranges. Subgroup 
analysis revealed interaction effects in the general obesity, abdominal obesity, 
and impaired fasting glucose subgroups (p = 0.014, 0.016, and < 0.001, 
respectively).
CONCLUSION: TyGI was associated with an increased sepsis-related short-term 
mortality risk and adverse outcomes after ICU admission.

BACKGROUND: We aimed to establish and validate a prognostic nomogram model for 
improving the prediction of 30-day mortality of gastrointestinal bleeding (GIB) 
in critically ill patients with severe sepsis.
METHODS: In this retrospective study, the current retrospective cohort study 
extracted data from the Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care IV 
(MIMIC-IV) database, then partitioned the cohort randomly into training and 
validation subsets. The cohort was partitioned into training and validation 
subsets randomly. Our primary endpoint was 30-day all-cause mortality. To reduce 
data dimensionality and identify predictive variables, the least absolute 
shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) regression was employed. A prediction 
model was constructed by multivariate logistic regression. Model performance was 
evaluated using the concordance index (C-index), receiver operating 
characteristic (ROC) curve, and decision curve analysis (DCA).
RESULTS: The analysis included 1435 total patients, comprising 1005 in the 
training cohort and 430 in the validation cohort. We found that age, smoking 
status, glucose, (BUN), lactate, Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (SOFA) 
score, mechanical ventilation≥48h (MV), parenteral nutrition (PN), and chronic 
obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) independently influenced mortality in 
sepsis patients with concomitant GIB. The C-indices were 0.746 (0.700-0.792) and 
0.716 (0.663-0.769) in the training and validation sets, respectively. Based on 
the area under the curve (AUC) and DCA, the nomogram exhibited good 
discrimination for 30-day all-cause mortality in sepsis with GIB.
CONCLUSIONS: For sepsis patients complicated with GIB, we created a unique 
nomogram model to predict the 30-day all-cause mortality. This model could be a 
significant therapeutic tool for clinicians in terms of personalized treatment 
and prognosis prediction.

BACKGROUND: Sepsis is a syndrome involving multi-organ dysfunction, and the 
mortality in sepsis patients correlates with the number of lesioned organs. 
Precise prognosis models play a pivotal role in enabling healthcare 
practitioners to administer timely and accurate interventions for sepsis, 
thereby augmenting patient outcomes. Nevertheless, the majority of available 
models consider the overall physiological attributes of patients, overlooking 
the asynchronous spatiotemporal interactions among multiple organ systems. These 
constraints hinder a full application of such models, particularly when dealing 
with limited clinical data. To surmount these challenges, a comprehensive model, 
denoted as recurrent Graph Attention Network-multi Gated Recurrent Unit 
(rGAT-mGRU), was proposed. Taking into account the intricate spatiotemporal 
interactions among multiple organ systems, the model predicted in-hospital 
mortality of sepsis using data collected within the 48-hour period 
post-diagnosis.
MATERIAL AND METHODS: Multiple parallel GRU sub-models were formulated to 
investigate the temporal physiological variations of single organ systems. 
Meanwhile, a GAT structure featuring a memory unit was constructed to capture 
spatiotemporal connections among multi-organ systems. Additionally, an 
attention-injection mechanism was employed to govern the data flowing within the 
network pertaining to multi-organ systems. The proposed model underwent training 
and testing using a dataset of 10,181 sepsis cases extracted from the Medical 
Information Mart for Intensive Care III (MIMIC-III) database. To evaluate the 
model's superiority, it was compared with the existing common baseline models. 
Furthermore, ablation experiments were designed to elucidate the rationale and 
robustness of the proposed model.
RESULTS: Compared with the baseline models for predicting mortality of sepsis, 
the rGAT-mGRU model demonstrated the largest area under the receiver operating 
characteristic curve (AUROC) of 0.8777 ± 0.0039 and the maximum area under the 
precision-recall curve (AUPRC) of 0.5818 ± 0.0071, with sensitivity of 
0.8358 ± 0.0302 and specificity of 0.7727 ± 0.0229, respectively. The proposed 
model was capable of delineating the varying contribution of the involved organ 
systems at distinct moments, as specifically illustrated by the attention 
weights. Furthermore, it exhibited consistent performance even in the face of 
limited clinical data.
CONCLUSION: The rGAT-mGRU model has the potential to indicate sepsis prognosis 
by extracting the dynamic spatiotemporal interplay information inherent in 
multi-organ systems during critical diseases, thereby providing clinicians with 
auxiliary decision-making support.

OBJECTIVE: Hypoproteinemia is common in patients with acute heart failure, 
especially in the intensive care unit (ICU). We assessed short-term mortality in 
patients with acute heart failure for albumin and nonalbumin users.
METHODS: Our study was a retrospective, observational and single-center study. 
We included patients with acute heart failure from the Medical Information Mart 
for Intensive Care-IV and compared short-term mortality and length of hospital 
stay in patients with and without albumin use. We used propensity score matching 
(PSM) to adjust for confounders, a multivariate Cox proportional hazard 
regression model, and performed subgroup analysis.
RESULTS: We enrolled 1706 patients with acute heart failure (318 albumin users 
and 1388 nonalbumin users). The 30-day overall mortality rate was 15.1% 
(258/1706). After PSM, the 30-day overall mortality was 22.9% (67/292) in the 
nonalbumin group and 13.7% (40/292) in the albumin group. In the Cox regression 
model, after propensity matching, the albumin use group was associated with a 
47% reduction in 30-day overall mortality [hazard ratio (HR) = 0.53, 95% 
confidence interval (CI): 0.36-0.78, P = 0.001]. In subgroup analysis, the 
association was more significant in males, patients with heart failure with 
reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF), and nonsepsis patients.
CONCLUSION: In conclusion, our investigation suggests that the use of albumin 
was associated with lower 30-day mortality in patients with acute heart failure, 
especially in males, those aged >75 years, those with HFrEF, those with higher 
N-terminal pro-brain natriuretic peptide levels, and those without sepsis.

OBJECTIVES: Sepsis is an infection-caused syndrome, that leads to 
life-threatening organ damage. We aim to develop machine learning models with 
large-scale data to predict sepsis patients' mortality.
DESIGN: we extracted sepsis patients from two databases, Medical Information 
Mart for Intensive Care IV (MIMIC-IV) as a train set and Philips eICU 
Collaborative Research Database as a test set.
SETTING: ICUs in multicenter hospitals in the USA during 2012-2019.
PATIENTS OR PARTICIPANTS: A total of 21,680 sepsis-3 patients are included in 
the study, in which, 3771 patients were dead and 17,909 survived during 
hospitalization, respectively.
INTERVENTIONS: No interventions.
MAIN VARIABLES OF INTEREST: Basic information, examination items during 
hospitalization and some medication and treatment information are incorporated 
into analyzed. Seven different models were built with a Support vector machine, 
Decision Tree Classifier, Random Forest, Gradients Boosting, Multiple Layer 
Perception, Xgboost, light Gradients Boosting to predict dead or live during 
hospitalization.
RESULTS: Algorithms with an AUC value in the test set of the top three: light 
GBM, GBM, Xgboost. Considering the performance of the training set and the test 
set, the light GBM model performs best, and then the parameters of the model 
were adjusted, after that the AUC value was 0.99 in the train set, 0.96 in the 
test set, respectively.
CONCLUSIONS: Models built with light GBM algorithm from real-world sepsis 
patients from electronic health records accurately predict whether sepsis 
patients are dead and can be incorporated into clinical decision tools to 
enhance the prognosis of the patient and prevent adverse outcomes.

BACKGROUND: In recent years, the hemoglobin, albumin, lymphocyte, and platelet 
(HALP) score has emerged as a potential marker of immunological and nutritional 
status. This study aimed to evaluate the association between the HALP score and 
prognosis in patients with sepsis.
METHODS: This retrospective cohort study analyzed sepsis patients using clinical 
data from the Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care IV (MIMIC-IV) 
database. Patients were classified into Low-score and High-score groups. 
Confounding factors were controlled through propensity score matching (PSM) 
analysis. The primary outcome was 28-day mortality in individuals with sepsis. 
Survival probabilities between groups were compared using Kaplan-Meier curves. 
Multivariable Cox regression analysis and a smoothing spline fitting curve were 
employed to investigate the relationship between the HALP score and 28-day 
mortality. ROC curve analysis and subgroup analysis were performed to evaluate 
the predictive ability of the HALP score and its components.
RESULTS: A total of 2,968 sepsis patients were included, with 809 (27.26%) 
deaths within 28 days. After PSM analysis, the High-score group had a 24% lower 
risk of 28-day mortality compared to the Low-score group (HR, 0.76; 95% CI, 
0.64-0.91). In the unmatched cohort, the multivariable Cox regression model also 
indicated that the High-score group had a lower 28-day mortality risk (HR, 0.78; 
95% CI, 0.67-0.91). The smoothing spline fitting curve showed a nonlinear 
relationship between the HALP score and 28-day mortality, with an inflection 
point at 24.69. When the HALP score was below 24.69, an increase of one point in 
the HALP score was associated with a 2% reduction in 28-day mortality (HR, 0.98; 
95% CI, 0.97-0.99). The HALP score provided incremental predictive value for 
28-day mortality when combined with the SOFA score. Albumin was identified as 
the most influential component of the HALP score.
CONCLUSION: Among patients with sepsis, the HALP score exhibited a nonlinear 
relationship with 28-day mortality. An elevated HALP score is associated with 
reduced 28-day, 90-day, 360-day, and in-hospital mortality among sepsis 
patients.

We aimed to explore factors associated with mortality of diabetic kidney disease 
(DKD), and to establish a prediction model for predicting the mortality of DKD. 
This was a cohort study. In total, 1,357 DKD patients were identified from the 
Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care IV (MIMIC-IV) database, with 505 DKD 
patients being identified from the MIMIC-III as the testing set. The outcome of 
the study was 1-year mortality. COX proportional hazard models were applied to 
screen the predictive factors. The prediction model was conducted based on the 
predictive factors. A receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve with the 
area under the curve (AUC) was calculated to evaluate the performance of the 
prediction model. The median follow-up time was 365.00 (54.50,365.00) days, and 
586 patients (43.18%) died within 1 year. The predictive factors for 1-year 
mortality in DKD included age, weight, sepsis, heart rate, temperature, Charlson 
Comorbidity Index (CCI), Simplified Acute Physiology Score (SAPS) II, and 
Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (SOFA), lymphocytes, red cell distribution 
width (RDW), serum albumin, and metformin. The AUC of the prediction model for 
predicting 1-year mortality in the training set was 0.771 [95% confidence 
interval (CI): 0.746-0.795] and the AUC of the prediction model in the testing 
set was 0.795 (95% CI: 0.756-0.834). This study establishes a prediction model 
for predicting mortality of DKD, providing a basis for clinical intervention and 
decision-making in time.

The heterogeneity nature of sepsis is significantly impacted by the site of 
infection. This study aims to explore the predictive value of multiple scoring 
systems in assessing the prognosis of septic patients across different infection 
sites. Data for this retrospective cohort study were extracted from the Medical 
Information Mart for Intensive Care IV database (MIMIC-IV) (v2.2). Adult 
patients meeting the criteria for sepsis 3.0 and admitted to the intensive care 
unit (ICU) were enrolled. Infection sites included were pneumonia, urinary tract 
infection (UTI), cellulitis, abdominal infection, and bacteremia. The primary 
outcome assessed was 28-day mortality. The sequential Organ Failure Assessment 
(SOFA) score, Oxford Acute Severity of Illness Score (OASIS), and Logistic Organ 
Dysfunction System (LODS) score were compared. Binomial logistic regression 
analysis was conducted to evaluate the association between these variables and 
mortality. Additionally, differences in the area under the curve (AUC) of 
receiver operating characteristic (ROC) among the scoring systems were analyzed. 
A total of 4721 patients were included in the analysis. The average 28-day 
mortality rate was 9.4%. Significant differences were observed in LODS, OASIS, 
and SOFA scores between the 28-day survival and non-survival groups across 
different infection sites (p < 0.01). In the pneumonia group and abdominal 
infection group, both the LODS and OASIS scoring systems emerged as independent 
risk factors for mortality in septic patients (odds ratio [OR]: 1.165, 95% 
confidence interval [CI]: 1.109-1.224, p < 0.001; OR: 1.047, 95% CI: 
1.028-1.065, p < 0.001) (OR: 1.200, 95% CI: 1.091-1.319, p < 0.001; OR: 1.060, 
95% CI: 1.025-1.095, p < 0.001). For patients with UTI, the LODS, OASIS, and 
SOFA scoring systems were identified as independent risk factors for mortality 
(OR: 1.142, 95% CI: 1.068-1.220, p < 0.001; OR: 1.062, 95% CI: 1.037-1.087, p < 
0.001; OR: 1.146, 95% CI: 1.046-1.255, p = 0.004), with the AUC of LODS score 
and OASIS significantly higher than that of the SOFA score (p = 0.006). Among 
patients with cellulitis, the OASIS and SOFA scoring systems were identified as 
independent risk factors for mortality (OR: 1.055, 95% CI: 1.007-1.106, p = 
0.025; OR: 1.187, 95% CI: 1.005-1.403, p = 0.044), with no significant 
difference in prognosis prediction observed (p = 0.243). In the bacteremia 
group, the LODS scoring system was identified as an independent risk factor for 
mortality (OR: 1.165, 95% CI: 1.109-1.224, p < 0.001). The findings suggest that 
LODS scores offer better prognostic accuracy for predicting the mortality risk 
in septic patients with pneumonia, abdominal infections, bacteremia, and UTI 
compared to SOFA scores.

BACKGROUND Little is known about the relationship between the site of infection, 
type of pathogen, and the occurrence of sepsis-associated liver dysfunction 
(SALD). This population study aimed to identify the sites and types of infection 
in SALD patients. MATERIAL AND METHODS We conducted a retrospective 
observational study using the Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care III. 
Patients with sepsis were divided into a SALD group and a control group. We 
evaluated the effect of the location of culture-positive specimens and the 
distribution of pathogens on the occurrence of SALD and then compared the 
clinical outcomes. RESULTS A total of 14 596 admissions were included, and the 
incidence of SALD was 11.96%. Positive bile culture (odds ratio [OR] 7.450, 
P<0.001), peritoneal fluid culture (OR 3.616, P<0.001), and blood culture (OR 
1.957, P<0.001) were correlated with the occurrence of SALD. Infection with 
Enterococcus faecium (OR 3.065, P<0.001), Bacteroides fragilis (OR 2.061, 
P<0.001), Klebsiella oxytoca (OR 2.066, P<0.001), Enterobacter aerogenes (OR 
1.92, P=0.001), and Aspergillus fumigatus (OR 2.144, P=0.001) were correlated 
with the occurrence of SALD. The Intensive Care Unit mortality and hospital 
mortality were higher in the SALD group than in the control group (24.7% 
vs 9.0%, P<0.001; 34.2% vs 13.8%, P<0.001, respectively). CONCLUSIONS SALD 
should be considered for patients with sepsis whose infection site is the 
biliary system, abdominal cavity, or blood and the pathogen is Enterococcus 
faecium, B. fragilis, K. oxytoca, Enterobacter aerogenes, or A. fumigatus. When 
SALD occurs in patients with sepsis, the above infection sites and pathogens 
should be considered first.

BACKGROUND: This study aimed to investigate the relationship between the blood 
urea nitrogen to serum albumin ratio (BAR) and in-hospital mortality in patients 
with sepsis.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: This is a retrospective cohort study. All septic patient 
data for the study were obtained from the intensive care unit of Beth Israel 
Deaconess Medical Center. Adjusted hazard ratios (HRs) and 95% confidence 
intervals (CIs) were calculated using multivariable Cox regression analyses. 
Survival curves were plotted and subgroup analyses were stratified by relevant 
covariates.
RESULTS: Among 23,901 patients, 13,464 with sepsis were included. The overall 
in-hospital mortality rate was 18.9% (2550/13464). After adjustment for 
confounding factors, patients in the highest BAR quartile had an increased risk 
of sepsis death than those in the lowest BAR quartile (HR: 1.42, 95% CI: 
1.3-1.55), using BAR as a categorical variable. When BAR was presented as a 
continuous variable, the prevalence of in-hospital sepsis-related death 
increased by 8% (adjusted HR: 1.08, 95% CI: 1.07-1.1, P < 0.001) for each 5-unit 
increase in BAR, irrespective of confounders. Stratified analyses indicated age 
interactions (P < 0.001), and the correlation between BAR and the probability of 
dying due to sepsis was stable.
CONCLUSION: BAR was significantly associated with in-hospital mortality in 
intensive care patients with sepsis. A higher BAR in patients with sepsis is 
associated with a worse prognosis in the ICU in the USA. However, further 
research is required to confirm this finding.

OBJECTIVE: To explore the relationship between serum calcium levels and the 
prognosis of severe acute osteomyelitis, and to assess the effectiveness of 
calcium levels in prognostic evaluation.
METHODS: Relevant patient records of individuals diagnosed with severe acute 
osteomyelitis were obtained for this retrospective study from the Medical 
Information Mart for Intensive Care (MIMIC-IV). The study aimed to assess the 
impact of different indicators on prognosis by utilizing COX regression 
analysis. To enhance prognostic prediction for critically ill patients, a 
nomogram was developed. The discriminatory capacity of the nomogram was 
evaluated using the Area Under the Curve (AUC) of the Receiver Operating 
Characteristic (ROC) curve, in addition to the calibration curve.
RESULT: The study analyzed a total of 1,133 cases of severe acute osteomyelitis, 
divided into the survivor group (1,025 cases) and the non-survivor group (108 
cases). Significant differences were observed between the two groups in terms of 
age, hypertension, sepsis, renal injury, and various laboratory indicators, 
including WBC, PLT, Ca2+, CRP, hemoglobin, albumin, and creatinine (P<0.05). 
However, no significant differences were found in race, gender, marital status, 
detection of wound microbiota, blood sugar, lactate, and ALP levels. A 
multivariate COX proportional hazards model was constructed using age, 
hypertension, sepsis, Ca2+, creatinine, albumin, and hemoglobin as variables. 
The results revealed that hypertension and sepsis had a significant impact on 
survival time (HR=0.514, 95% CI 0.339-0.779, P=0.002; HR=1.696, 95% CI 
1.056-2.723, P=0.029). Age, hemoglobin, Ca2+, albumin, and creatinine also 
showed significant effects on survival time (P<0.05). However, no statistically 
significant impact on survival time was observed for the other variables 
(P>0.05). To predict the survival time, a nomogram was developed using the 
aforementioned indicators and achieved an AUC of 0.841. The accuracy of the 
nomogram was further confirmed by the ROC curve and calibration curve.
CONCLUSION: According to the findings, this study establishes that a reduction 
in serum calcium levels serves as a distinct and standalone predictor of 
mortality among individuals diagnosed with severe acute osteomyelitis during 
their stay in the Intensive Care Unit (ICU) within a span of two years.

BACKGROUND: Predicting and reducing the 28-day mortality in sepsis remains a 
challenge in this research field.
OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to explore the association between hypertension and 
28-day mortality in sepsis.
METHODS: This study is a cross-sectional approach with Mendelian Randomization 
(MR). We used GWAS data for hypertension as the exposure and 28-day mortality in 
sepsis as the outcome and employed the main inverse variance weighted method 
along with other supplementary MR techniques to verify the causal association 
between hypertension and 28-day mortality in sepsis. We used sensitivity 
analyses to ensure the robustness of the research findings. Finally, we utilized 
clinical data from the Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care-IV database 
to assess the risk association between hypertension and 28-day mortality in 
sepsis using difference analysis and multivariate logistic regression analysis.
RESULTS: According to MR, hypertension increased the 28-day mortality in sepsis 
in both two datasets (FinnGen: odds ratio [OR] = 1.61, 95 % confidence interval 
[CI] = 1.15-2.26, p = 0.006; Medical Research Council-Integrative 
Epidemiological Unit: OR = 160, 95 % CI = 2.76-9250, p = 0.014). In our 
observational study, we included a total of 2012 sepsis patients, of which 60.5 
% were male, and the average age was 55.4 years. By applying univariate and 
multivariate logistic regression models (univariate analysis p = 0.02, 
multivariate analysis p = 0.02), we observed a significantly increased risk of 
28-day mortality due to hypertension in sepsis patients.
CONCLUSION: This study confirmed the causal relationship between hypertension 
and the 28-day mortality in sepsis.

BACKGROUND: Sepsis remains the leading cause of mortality in critically ill 
patients, and mortality is increased when acute kidney injury (AKI) occurs. The 
Kidney Disease: Improving Global Outcomes (KDIGO) guideline recommends the 
implementation of supportive measures in patients at high risk for AKI. However, 
it remains unclear to what extent these nephroprotective measures are 
implemented in daily clinical practice in critically ill patients, especially 
those with high-risk exposures such as sepsis.
METHODS: We analyzed the Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care IV 
(MIMIC-IV) database to identify septic patients with and without AKI. The 
primary outcome of interest was the adherence to the KDIGO bundle consisting of 
avoidance of nephrotoxic agents, implementation of a functional hemodynamic 
monitoring, optimization of perfusion pressure and volume status, close 
monitoring of renal function, avoidance of hyperglycemia, and avoidance of 
radiocontrast agents. Secondary outcomes included the development of AKI, 
progression of AKI, the use of renal replacement therapy (RRT), mortality, and a 
composite end point consisting of progression of AKI and mortality within 7 
days.
RESULTS: Our analysis included 34,679 patients with sepsis with 1.6% receiving 
the complete bundle (10% received 5, 42.3% 4, 35.4% 3, and 9.8% 2 bundle 
components). In 56.4%, nephrotoxic agents were avoided, and hemodynamic 
optimization was reached in 86.5%. Secondary end points were improved in 
patients with bundle adherence. Avoidance of nephrotoxic drugs and optimization 
of hemodynamics were significantly associated with lower rates of AKI and 
improved patient outcomes, including 30-day mortality.
CONCLUSIONS: Implementation of the KDIGO bundle is poor in patients with sepsis 
but may be associated with improved outcomes.

The increased use of electronic health records (EHRs) has improved the 
availability of routine care data for medical research. Combined with machine 
learning techniques this has spurred the development of early warning scores 
(EWSs) in hospitals worldwide. EWSs are commonly used in the hospital where they 
have been developed, yet few have been transported to external settings and/or 
internationally. In this perspective, we describe our experiences in 
implementing the TREWScore, a septic shock EWS, and the transportability 
challenges regarding domain, predictors, and clinical outcome we faced. We used 
data of 53,330 ICU stays from Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care-III 
(MIMIC-III) and 18,013 ICU stays from the University Medical Center (UMC) 
Utrecht, including 17,023 (31.9%) and 2,557 (14.2%) cases of sepsis, 
respectively. The MIMIC-III and UMC populations differed significantly regarding 
the length of stay (6.9 vs. 9.0 days) and hospital mortality (11.6% vs. 13.6%). 
We mapped all 54 TREWScore predictors to the UMC database: 31 were readily 
available, seven required unit conversion, 14 had to be engineered, one 
predictor required text mining, and one predictor could not be mapped. Lastly, 
we classified sepsis cases for septic shock using the sepsis-2 criteria. Septic 
shock populations (UMC 31.3% and MIMIC-III 23.3%) and time to shock events 
showed significant differences between the two cohorts. In conclusion, we 
identified challenges to transportability and implementation regarding domain, 
predictors, and clinical outcome when transporting EWS between hospitals across 
two continents. These challenges need to be systematically addressed to improve 
model transportability between centers and unlock the potential clinical utility 
of EWS.

BACKGROUND: Electrolyte disturbances are prevalent complications in critically 
ill patients with sepsis, significantly impacting patient prognosis. However, 
the specific association between serum potassium levels and mortality risk in 
this population remains poorly understood. This study aimed to investigate the 
association between serum potassium levels during hospitalization and the risk 
of 28-day and 90-day mortality in critically ill patients with sepsis.
METHODS: Data were obtained from the Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care 
(MIMIC-IV) database, and patients with severe sepsis requiring ICU admission 
were stratified into quartiles based on their mean serum potassium levels. 
Outcomes assessed included 28-day and 90-day mortality. A multivariate Cox 
proportional hazards model was used to investigate the association between serum 
potassium levels and mortality, with restricted cubic splines to identify 
potential nonlinear correlations. A dichotomous Cox proportional hazards model 
was applied to analyze the association further, and Kaplan-Meier analysis 
assessed the mortality risk across different potassium ranges.
RESULTS: A total of 25,203 patients were included, with 28-day and 90-day 
mortality rates of 27.84% and 40.48%, respectively. Multivariate analysis showed 
a significant association between serum potassium levels and mortality. 
Restricted cubic splines identified an inflection point at 4.4 mmol/L, with 
potassium levels above this threshold associated with higher mortality (28-day 
mortality: HR 2.96, 95% CI = 2.43-3.60; 90-day mortality: HR 2.19, 95% CI = 
1.81-2.64). Kaplan-Meier analysis confirmed a significantly higher risk of death 
for patients with serum potassium levels above 4.4 mmol/L compared to those 
within the 3.5-4.4 mmol/L range (P<0.001).
CONCLUSION: In critically ill patients with sepsis, serum potassium levels 
exceeding 4.4 mmol/L are associated with an increased risk of death. Maintaining 
the average serum potassium level within the range of 3.5-4.4 mmol/L appears to 
be safe and may contribute to better outcomes in this patient population.

OBJECTIVE: To investigate the association between renal mean perfusion pressure 
(MPP) and prognosis in sepsis-associated acute kidney injury (SA-AKI).
METHODS: Data were extracted from the Medical Information Mart for Intensive 
Care IV (MIMIC-IV) database. Group-based trajectory modeling (GBTM) was applied 
to identify dynamic MPP patterns, while restricted cubic spline (RCS) curves 
were utilized to confirm the non-linear relationship between MPP and mortality. 
Cox regression analysis assessed the risk of mortality across different MPP 
levels, adjusting for potential confounders. Subgroup analyses and sensitivity 
analyses were conducted to ensure the robustness of the findings.
RESULTS: A total of 2318 patients with SA-AKI were stratified into five MPP 
trajectories by GBTM. Patients in Traj-1 and Traj-2, characterized by 
consistently low MPP (<60 mmHg), demonstrated markedly higher 90-d mortality 
(62.86% and 26.98%). RCS curves revealed a non-linear inverse relationship 
between MPP and 90-d mortality, identifying 60 mmHg as the optimal threshold. 
Patients with MPP ≤ 60 mmHg exhibited significantly elevated 90-d mortality 
compared to those with MPP > 60 mmHg (29.81% vs. 20.88%). Cox regression 
analysis established Traj-1 and Traj-2 as independent risk factors for increased 
mortality relative to Traj-3 (60-70 mmHg), with hazard ratios (HRs) of 4.67 
(95%-CI 3.28-6.67) and 1.45 (95%-CI 1.20-1.76). MPP > 60 mmHg was significantly 
associated with reduced 90-d mortality (HR 0.65, 95%-CI 0.55-0.77). Subgroup and 
PSM analyses supported these findings.
CONCLUSIONS: Dynamic MPP trajectory serves as a valuable prognostic biomarker 
for SA-AKI. Early monitoring of MPP trends offers critical insights into renal 
perfusion management, potentially improving outcomes in SA-AKI.

BACKGROUND: Lactate-to-albumin ratio (LAR) is an emergency predictive indicator 
of sepsis-related mortality. An elevated LAR is associated with poor outcomes in 
critically ill patients. However, its predictive value for acute kidney injury 
(AKI) in patients with sepsis remains unclear. Therefore, this study aimed to 
investigate the relationship between LAR and AKI in patients with sepsis.
METHODS: The study population was derived from the Medical Information Mart for 
Intensive Care-IV (2.0) database and stratified into quartiles based on the LAR. 
The primary endpoint was the occurrence of AKI. The secondary endpoints were the 
use of renal replacement therapy (RRT) and in-hospital mortality. Kaplan-Meier 
survival analysis and Cox proportional hazards models were used to assess the 
association between the LAR index and risk of AKI in patients with sepsis.
RESULTS: In this study, 5,222 patients with sepsis were included, of whom 3,029 
were male (58%). Kaplan-Meier survival analysis demonstrated significant 
differences in the cumulative incidence of AKI and cumulative usage rate of RRT 
among patients with sepsis based on the quartiles of the LAR index. 
Additionally, Cox proportional hazards analysis adjusted for confounding factors 
showed a significant association between the LAR index and incidence of AKI in 
patients with sepsis.
CONCLUSION: Our study indicated that a high LAR index can serve as an 
independent predictor of AKI in patients with sepsis.

BACKGROUND: Septic shock (SS) is a syndrome with high mortality. Early 
forewarning and diagnosis of SS, which are critical in reducing mortality, are 
still challenging in clinical management.
OBJECTIVE: We propose a simple and fast risk-stratified forewarning model for SS 
to help physicians recognize patients in time. Moreover, further insights can be 
gained from the application of the model to improve our understanding of SS.
METHODS: A total of 5125 patients with sepsis from the Medical Information Mart 
for Intensive Care-IV (MIMIC-IV) database were divided into training, 
validation, and test sets. In addition, 2180 patients with sepsis from the eICU 
Collaborative Research Database (eICU) were used as an external validation set. 
We developed a simplified risk-stratified early forewarning model for SS based 
on the weight of evidence and logistic regression, which was compared with 
multi-feature complex models, and clinical characteristics among risk groups 
were evaluated.
RESULTS: Using only vital signs and rapid arterial blood gas test features 
according to feature importance, we constructed the Septic Shock Risk Predictor 
(SORP), with an area under the curve (AUC) of 0.9458 in the test set, which is 
only slightly lower than that of the optimal multi-feature complex model 
(0.9651). A median forewarning time of 13 hours was calculated for SS patients. 
4 distinct risk groups (high, medium, low, and ultralow) were identified by the 
SORP 6 hours before onset, and the incidence rates of SS in the 4 risk groups in 
the postonset interval were 88.6% (433/489), 34.5% (262/760), 2.5% (67/2707), 
and 0.3% (4/1301), respectively. The severity increased significantly with 
increasing risk in both clinical features and survival. Clustering analysis 
demonstrated a high similarity of pathophysiological characteristics between the 
high-risk patients without SS diagnosis (NS_HR) and the SS patients, while a 
significantly worse overall survival was shown in NS_HR patients. On further 
exploring the characteristics of the treatment and comorbidities of the NS_HR 
group, these patients demonstrated a significantly higher incidence of mean 
blood pressure <65 mmHg, significantly lower vasopressor use and infused volume, 
and more severe renal dysfunction. The above findings were further validated by 
multicenter eICU data.
CONCLUSIONS: The SORP demonstrated accurate forewarning and a reliable risk 
stratification capability. Among patients forewarned as high risk, similar 
pathophysiological phenotypes and high mortality were observed in both those 
subsequently diagnosed as having SS and those without such a diagnosis. NS_HR 
patients, overlooked by the Sepsis-3 definition, may provide further insights 
into the pathophysiological processes of SS onset and help to complement its 
diagnosis and precise management. The importance of precise fluid resuscitation 
management in SS patients with renal dysfunction is further highlighted. For 
convenience, an online service for the SORP has been provided.

Background: Inflammatory-coagulation dysfunction plays an increasingly important 
role in sepsis associated acute kidney injury (SAKI). This study aimed to 
investigate whether early heparin therapy improves survival in patients with 
SAKI. Methods: Patients with SAKI were identified from the Medical Information 
Mart for Intensive Care-IV database. The patients were divided into two groups: 
those who received heparin subcutaneously within 48 h after intensive care unit 
(ICU) admission and the control group, who received no heparin. The primary 
endpoint was ICU mortality, the secondary outcomes were 7-day, 14-day, 28-day, 
and hospital mortality. Propensity score matching (PSM), marginal structural Cox 
model (MSCM), and E-value analyses were performed. Results: The study included 
5623 individuals with SAKI, 2410 of whom received heparin and 3213 of whom did 
not. There were significant effects on ICU and 28-day mortality in the overall 
population with PSM. MSCM further reinforces the efficacy of heparin 
administration reduces ICU mortality in the general population. Stratification 
analysis with MSCM showed that heparin administration was associated with 
decreased ICU mortality at various AKI stages. Heparin use was also associated 
with reduced 28-day mortality in patients with only female, age >60 years, and 
AKI stage 3, with HRs of 0.79, 0.77, and 0.60, respectively (p < 0.05). E-value 
analysis suggests robustness to unmeasured confounding. Conclusion: Early 
heparin therapy for patients with SAKI decreased ICU mortality. Further analysis 
demonstrated that heparin therapy was associated with reduced 28-day mortality 
rate in patients only among female, age > 60 years and AKI stage 3.

BACKGROUND: In sepsis, the relationship between lymphocyte counts and patient 
outcomes is complex. Lymphocytopenia and lymphocytosis significantly influence 
survival, illustrating the dual functionality of lymphocytes in responding to 
infections. This study investigates this complex interaction, focusing on how 
variations in lymphocyte counts correlate with all-cause hospital mortality 
among sepsis patients.
METHODS: This retrospective cohort study analyzed data from two extensive 
critical care databases: the Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care IV 2.0 
(MIMIC-IV 2.0) from Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center, Boston, Massachusetts, 
and the eICU Collaborative Research Database (eICU-CRD), which was Multi-center 
database from over 200 hospitals across the United States conducted by Philips 
eICU Research Institute. We included adult patients aged 18 years and older who 
met the Sepsis-3 criteria, characterized by documented or suspected infection 
and a Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (SOFA) score of 2 or higher. Sepsis 
patients were categorized into quartiles based on lymphocyte counts. The primary 
outcome was all-cause mortality in the hospital, with 90 and 60-day all-cause 
mortality as the secondary outcomes. Univariable and multivariable Cox 
proportional hazard regressions were utilized to assess lymphocyte counts' 
impact on hospital mortality. An adjusted restricted cubic spline (RCS) analysis 
was performed to elucidate this relationship further. Subgroup analyses were 
also conducted to explore the association across various comorbidity groups 
among sepsis and septic shock patients.
RESULTS: Our study included 37,054 patients, with an observed in-hospital 
mortality rate of 16.6%. Univariable and multivariable Cox proportional hazard 
regression models showed that lymphocyte counts were independently associated 
with in-hospital mortality (HR = 1.04, P < 0.01; HR = 1.06, P < 0.01). RCS 
regression analysis revealed a U-shaped relationship between lymphocyte levels 
and hospital mortality risk in sepsis and septic shock patients (P for 
overall < 0.001, P for nonliner < 0.01; P for overall = 0.002, P for 
nonliner = 0.014). Subgroup analyses revealed that elevated lymphocyte counts 
correlated with increased hospital mortality among sepsis patients with liver 
disease and requiring renal replacement therapy (P for overall = 0.021, P for 
nonliner = 0.158; P for overall = 0.025, P for nonliner = 0.759). These findings 
suggest that lymphocytes may have enhanced prognostic value in specific subsets 
of critically ill sepsis patients.
CONCLUSION: Our findings demonstrate that lymphocyte counts are a significant 
independent predictor of hospital mortality in sepsis and septic shock patients. 
We observed a U-shaped association between lymphocyte levels and mortality risk, 
indicating that high and low counts are linked to increased mortality. This 
result highlights the complex role of lymphocytes in sepsis outcomes and 
suggests the need for further investigation into the underlying mechanisms and 
potential therapeutic approaches. Integrating lymphocyte count assessment into 
risk stratification algorithms and clinical decision support tools could enhance 
the early identification of high-risk sepsis patients.

Objective: The study aims to develop a mechanical learning model as a predictive 
model for predicting the appearance of sepsis-associated encephalopathy (SAE). 
Materials and Methods: The prediction model was developed in a primary cohort of 
2,028 sepsis patients from June 2001 to October 2012, retrieved from the Medical 
Information Mart for Intensive Care (MIMIC III) database. Least absolute 
shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) regression model was used for data 
dimension reduction and feature selection. The model was developed using 
multivariable logistic regression analysis. The performance of the nomogram has 
been evaluated in terms of calibration, discrimination, and clinical utility. 
Results: There were nine particular features in septic patients that were 
significantly associated with SAE. Predictors of individualized prediction 
nomograms included age, rapid sequential evaluation of organ failure (qSOFA), 
and drugs including carbapenem antibiotics, quinolone antibiotics, steroids, 
midazolam, H2-antagonist, diphenhydramine hydrochloride, and heparin sodium 
injection. The area under the curve (AUC) was 0.743, indicating good 
discrimination. The prediction model showed calibration curves with minor 
deviations from the ideal predictions. Decision curve analysis (DCA) suggested 
that the nomogram was clinically useful. Conclusion: We propose a nomogram for 
the individualized prediction of SAE with satisfactory performance and clinical 
utility, which could aid the clinician in the early detection and management of 
SAE.

BACKGROUND: Currently, a scarcity of prognostic research exists that 
concentrates on patients with nephrotic syndrome (NS) who also have 
tuberculosis. The purpose of this study was to assess the in-hospital mortality 
status of NS patients with tuberculosis, identify crucial risk factors, and 
create a sturdy prognostic prediction model that can improve disease evaluation 
and guide clinical decision-making.
METHODS: We utilized the Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care IV version 
2.2 (MIMIC-IV v2.2) database to include 1,063 patients with NS complicated by TB 
infection. Confounding factors included demographics, vital signs, laboratory 
indicators, and comorbidities. The Least Absolute Shrinkage and Selection 
Operator (LASSO) regression and the diagnostic experiment the receiver operating 
characteristic (ROC) curve analyses were used to select determinant variables. A 
nomogram was established by using a logistic regression model. The performance 
of the nomogram was tested and validated using the concordance index (C-index) 
of the ROC curve, calibration curves, internal cross-validation, and clinical 
decision curve analysis.
RESULTS: The cumulative in-hospital mortality rate for patients with NS and TB 
was 18.7%. A nomogram was created to predict in-hospital mortality, utilizing 
Alb, Bun, INR, HR, Abp, Resp., Glu, CVD, Sepsis-3, and AKI stage 7 days. The 
area under the curve of the receiver operating characteristic evaluation was 
0.847 (0.812-0.881), with a calibration curve slope of 1.00 (0.83-1.17) and a 
mean absolute error of 0.013. The cross-validated C-index was 0.860. The 
decision curves indicated that the patients benefited from this model when the 
risk threshold was 0.1 and 0.81.
CONCLUSION: Our clinical prediction model nomogram demonstrated a good 
predictive ability for in-hospital mortality among patients with NS combined 
with TB. Therefore, it can aid clinicians in assessing the condition, judging 
prognosis, and making clinical decisions for such patients.

Sepsis-Associated Liver Injury (SALI) is an independent risk factor for death 
from sepsis. The aim of this study was to develop an interpretable machine 
learning model for early prediction of 28-day mortality in patients with SALI. 
Data from the Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care (MIMIC-IV, v2.2, 
MIMIC-III, v1.4) were used in this study. The study cohort from MIMIC-IV was 
randomized to the training set (0.7) and the internal validation set (0.3), with 
MIMIC-III (2001 to 2008) as external validation. The features with more than 20% 
missing values were deleted and the remaining features were multiple 
interpolated. Lasso-CV that lasso linear model with iterative fitting along a 
regularization path in which the best model is selected by cross-validation was 
used to select important features for model development. Eight machine learning 
models including Random Forest (RF), Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, Extreme 
Gradient Boost (XGBoost), K Nearest Neighbor, Support Vector Machine, 
Generalized Linear Models in which the best model is selected by 
cross-validation (CV_glmnet), and Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA) were 
developed. Shapley additive interpretation (SHAP) was used to improve the 
interpretability of the optimal model. At last, a total of 1043 patients were 
included, of whom 710 were from MIMIC-IV and 333 from MIMIC-III. Twenty-four 
clinically relevant parameters were selected for model construction. For the 
prediction of 28-day mortality of SALI in the internal validation set, the area 
under the curve (AUC (95% CI)) of RF was 0.79 (95% CI: 0.73-0.86), and which 
performed the best. Compared with the traditional disease severity scores 
including Oxford Acute Severity of Illness Score (OASIS), Sequential Organ 
Failure Assessment (SOFA), Simplified Acute Physiology Score II (SAPS II), 
Logistic Organ Dysfunction Score (LODS), Systemic Inflammatory Response Syndrome 
(SIRS), and Acute Physiology Score III (APS III), RF also had the best 
performance. SHAP analysis found that Urine output, Charlson Comorbidity Index 
(CCI), minimal Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS_min), blood urea nitrogen (BUN) and 
admission_age were the five most important features affecting RF model. 
Therefore, RF has good predictive ability for 28-day mortality prediction in 
SALI. Urine output, CCI, GCS_min, BUN and age at admission(admission_age) within 
24 h after intensive care unit(ICU) admission contribute significantly to model 
prediction.

BACKGROUND: Despite the extensive use of arterial catheterization (AC), clinical 
effectiveness of AC to alter the outcomes among patients with sepsis and septic 
shock has not been evaluated. The purpose of this study is to examine the 
association between the use of AC and in-hospital mortality in septic patients.
METHODS: Adult patients with sepsis from Medical Information Mart for Intensive 
Care database were screened to conduct this retrospective observational study. 
Propensity score matching (PSM) was employed to estimate the relationship 
between arterial catheterization (AC) and in-hospital mortality. Multivariable 
logistic regression and inverse probability of treatment weighing (IPTW) were 
used to validate our findings.
RESULTS: A total of 14,509 septic patients without shock and 4,078 septic shock 
patients were identified. 3,489 pairs in sepsis patients without shock and 589 
pairs in septic shock patients were yielded respectively after PSM. For patients 
in the sepsis without shock group, AC placement was associated with increased 
in-hospital mortality (OR, 1.34; 95% CI, 1.17-1.54; p < 0.001). In the septic 
shock group, there was no significant difference in hospital mortality between 
AC group and non-AC group. The results of logistic regression and propensity 
score IPTW model support our findings.
CONCLUSIONS: In hemodynamically stable septic patients, AC is independently 
associated with higher in-hospital mortality, while in patients with septic 
shock, AC was not associated with improvements in hospital mortality.

BACKGROUND: The use of SIRS and SOFA criteria in diagnosing sepsis among 
patients has been characterized by increasingly growing criticism. Indeed, the 
definition of sepsis has attracted significant controversy in history across 
medical and academic realms.
METHODS: The study used the Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care-III 
(MIMIC-III) database in assessing the effectiveness of the SIRS and SOFA 
diagnostic criteria. It ascertained the severity and specificity of sepsis 
infection in ICU patients. The Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care-III 
(MIMIC-III) database was established by the Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center 
(BIDMC) and MIT's Computational Physiology Laboratory. The database is a 
voluminous single-center database containing information pertaining to 38,000 
adults who were admitted to the BIDMC in the 11 years leading up to 2012. The 
identification of patients with sepsis was conducted using the International 
Classification of Diseases (ICD-10-CM) diagnosis codes.
RESULTS: The analysis of data for this study was based on the chi-square test, 
which is significant in comparing the specificity, mortality, and sensitivity of 
the data. The process of screening the MIMIC-III database resulted in the 
identification of 21,368 patients with infections from the hospital admissions 
in the database. The results also indicate a significantly higher mortality rate 
within 28 days of admission in sepsis-3 patients compared with sepsis-1. In this 
experiment, we limited the study period to 28 days to restrict the potential of 
mortality caused by other factors. Additionally, we evaluated the clinical 
factors associated with the sepsis-1 or sepsis-3 and found out similar results 
in the analysis for sepsis-1 and sepsis-3.
CONCLUSIONS: The study results also portray numerous challenges in using the 
sepsis-3 criteria as a diagnostic tool. In particular, the ICD-10-CM diagnosis 
approach was limiting because it inhibited the measure of uncertainty of 
infection present at the beginning of the two diagnostic criteria of sepsis-1 
and sepsis-3.

BACKGROUND: Sepsis has a high mortality rate, which is expensive to treat, and 
is a major drain on healthcare resources; it seriously impacts the quality of 
human life. The clinical features of positive or non-positive blood cultures 
have been reported, but the clinical features of sepsis with different microbial 
infections and how they contribute to clinical outcomes have not been adequately 
described.
METHODS: We extracted clinical data of septic patients with a single pathogen 
from the online Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care(MIMIC)-IV database. 
Based on microbial cultures, patients were classified into Gram-negative, 
Gram-positive, and fungal groups. Then, we analyzed the clinical characteristics 
of sepsis patients with Gram-negative, Gram-positive, and fungal infections. The 
primary outcome was 28-day mortality. The secondary outcomes were in-hospital 
mortality, the length of hospital stay, the length of ICU stay, and the 
ventilation duration. In addition, Kaplan-Meier analysis was used for the 28-day 
cumulative survival rate of patients with sepsis. Finally, we performed further 
univariate and multivariate regression analyses for 28-day mortality and created 
a nomogram for predicting 28-day mortality.
RESULTS: The analysis showed that bloodstream infections showed a statistically 
significant difference in survival between Gram-positive and fungal organisms; 
drug resistance only reached statistical significance for Gram-positive 
bacteria. Through univariate and multivariate analysis, it was found that both 
the Gram-negative bacteria and fungi were independent risk factors for the 
short-term prognosis of sepsis patients. The multivariate regression model 
showed good discrimination, with a C-index of 0.788. We developed and validated 
a nomogram for the individualized prediction of 28-day mortality in patients 
with sepsis. Application of the nomogram still gave good calibration.
CONCLUSIONS: Organism type of infection is associated with mortality of sepsis, 
and early identification of the microbiological type of a patient with sepsis 
will provide an understanding of the patient's condition and guide treatment.

BACKGROUND: Sepsis-induced myocardial injury (SIMI) is a common organ 
dysfunction and is associated with higher mortality in patients with sepsis. We 
aim to construct a nomogram prediction model to assess the 28-day mortality in 
patients with SIMI. .
METHOD: We retrospectively extracted data from Medical Information Mart for 
Intensive Care (MIMIC-IV) open-source clinical database. SIMI was defined by 
Troponin T (higher than the 99th percentile of upper reference limit value) and 
patients with cardiovascular disease were excluded. A prediction model was 
constructed in the training cohort by backward stepwise Cox proportional hazards 
regression model. The concordance index (C-index), area under the receiver 
operating characteristics curve (AUC), net reclassification improvement (NRI), 
integrated discrimination improvement (IDI), calibration plotting and 
decision-curve analysis (DCA) were used to evaluate the nomogram.
RESULTS: 1312 patients with sepsis were included in this study and 1037 (79%) of 
them presented with SIMI. The multivariate Cox regression analysis in all septic 
patients revealed that SIMI was independently associated with 28-day mortality 
of septic patients. The risk factors of diabetes, Apache II score, mechanical 
ventilation, vasoactive support, Troponin T and creatinine were included in the 
model and a nomogram was constructed based on the model. The C-index, AUC, NRI, 
IDI, calibration plotting and DCA showed that the performance of the nomogram 
was better than the single SOFA score and Troponin T.
CONCLUSION: SIMI is related to the 28-day mortality of septic patients. The 
nomogram is a well-performed tool to predict accurately the 28-day mortality in 
patients with SIMI.

BACKGROUND: The severity of sepsis is associated with systemic clotting 
activation. Atrial fibrillation (AF) is the most commonly observed arrhythmia in 
patients with sepsis and can lead to a poor prognosis. The aim of this study is 
to elucidate the association between oral anticoagulants and survival from 
septic patients complicated with AF.
METHODS: The data of 8,828 septic patients, including 2,955 AF and 5,873 without 
AF, were all originated from the Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care IV 
(MIMIC-IV) database. Patients with sepsis and AF are divided into OAC- group 
(n = 1,774) and OAC+ group (n = 1,181) based on OAC therapy. Septic patients 
with no AF were considered as the control group (n = 5,873, sepsis and no AF 
group). The main outcome endpoint was the survival rate of 30 day. The secondary 
outcome endpoint was the length of stay (LOS) from intensive care unit and 
hospital. Propensity score matching (PSM) was used to adjust the influence of 
superfluous factors, and a restricted mean survival time (RMST) analysis was 
used for calculating the benefit of survival time and survival rate. Analysis 
including univariate and multivariate logistic regression analysis was conducted 
to find prognosis-related predictors.
RESULTS: After PSM, the OAC+group had a higher 30-day survival rate compared to 
the OAC- group (81.59% vs. 58.10%; P < 0.001) in the ICU. Despite the higher 
survival, the hospital LOS (14.65 days vs. 16.66 days; P = 0.15) and ICU LOS 
(6.93 days vs. 5.92 days; P = 0.02) were prolonged at OAC+ group than OAC- 
group. No difference was found in survival rate of 30 day between the sepsis 
patients using warfarin and patients using NOAC (85.60% vs. 79.84%, P = 0.12). 
The sepsis patients using warfarin had a prolonged LOS in ICU and hospital 
compared with the sepsis patients using NOAC. In the vasopressor subgroup, 
patients who received NOAC therapy were associated with a reduced 30-day 
survival rate (73.57% vs. 84.03%; P = 0.04) and reduced LOS in ICU and hospital 
than those on warfarin therapy.
CONCLUSION: This study demonstrated that oral anticoagulants may increase the 
30-day survival rate of patients with sepsis and AF.

Sepsis and hypertension pose significant health risks, yet the optimal mean 
arterial pressure (MAP) target for resuscitation remains uncertain. This study 
investigates the association between average MAP (a-MAP) within the initial 24 h 
of intensive care unit admission and clinical outcomes in patients with sepsis 
and primary hypertension using the Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care 
(MIMIC) IV database. Multivariable Cox regression assessed the association 
between a-MAP and 30-day mortality. Kaplan-Meier and log-rank analyses 
constructed survival curves, while restricted cubic splines (RCS) illustrated 
the nonlinear relationship between a-MAP and 30-day mortality. Subgroup analyses 
ensured robustness. The study involved 8,810 patients. Adjusted hazard ratios 
for 30-day mortality in the T1 group (< 73 mmHg) and T3 group (≥ 80 mmHg) 
compared to the T2 group (73-80 mmHg) were 1.25 (95% CI 1.09-1.43, P = 0.001) 
and 1.44 (95% CI 1.25-1.66, P < 0.001), respectively. RCS revealed a U-shaped 
relationship (non-linearity: P < 0.001). Kaplan-Meier curves demonstrated 
significant differences (P < 0.0001). Subgroup analysis showed no significant 
interactions. Maintaining an a-MAP of 73 to 80 mmHg may be associated with a 
reduction in 30-day mortality. Further validation through prospective randomized 
controlled trials is warranted.

BACKGROUND: Corticosteroids have been widely used as adjunct therapy for septic 
shock for many decades, but both the efficacy and safety remain unclear. The 
study was designed to investigate overall benefits and potential risks of 
corticosteroids in immunocompromised patients with septic shock.
METHODS: The Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care III (MIMIC-III) 
database was employed to conduct a cohort study. Immunocompromised patients with 
septic shock were enrolled and categorized by whether exposure to intravenous 
corticosteroids. Cox Proportional-Hazards models were used to control for 
confounders and assess the relationship between corticosteroids use and 
mortality.
RESULTS: A total of 866 patients were enrolled in this study, including 395 in 
the corticosteroids group and 471 in the non-corticosteroids group. 
Corticosteroids infusion was not associated with improved 30-day mortality in 
overall immunocompromised population [34.7% vs 32.1%; adjusted hazard ratio (HR) 
1.11, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.87-1.43, p = 0.37]. The mortality effects 
were similar in 90-day, 180-day, 1-year and hospital mortality. For the subgroup 
of patients with metastatic cancer, corticosteroids infusion was associated with 
a statistically significant increase in the 30-day mortality risk (HR 1.58, 95% 
CI 1.06-2.37; p = 0.02). Corticosteroids had adverse effects on hemodynamic 
stability, prolonged ICU and hospital duration, and increased risk of 
hyperglycemia.
CONCLUSIONS: Corticosteroids therapy for the maintenance of blood pressure was 
not associated with improved mortality or hemodynamic stability in overall 
immunocompromised population with septic shock. Future randomized clinical 
trials are required to validate the effects of corticosteroids for septic shock 
in the special immunocompromised population.

BACKGROUND: Sepsis is a leading cause of morbidity and mortality in hospitalized 
patients. Up to now, there are no well-established longitudinal networks from 
molecular mechanisms to clinical phenotypes in sepsis. Adding to the problem, 
about one of the five patients presented with diabetes. For this subgroup, 
management is difficult, and prognosis is difficult to evaluate.
METHODS: From the three databases, a total of 7,001 patients were enrolled on 
the basis of sepsis-3 standard and diabetes diagnosis. Input variable selection 
is based on the result of correlation analysis in a handpicking way, and 53 
variables were left. A total of 5,727 records were collected from Medical 
Information Mart for Intensive Care database and randomly split into a training 
set and an internal validation set at a ratio of 7:3. Then, logistic regression 
with lasso regularization, Bayes logistic regression, decision tree, random 
forest, and XGBoost were conducted to build the predictive model by using 
training set. Then, the models were tested by the internal validation set. The 
data from eICU Collaborative Research Database (n = 815) and dtChina critical 
care database (n = 459) were used to test the model performance as the external 
validation set.
RESULTS: In the internal validation set, the accuracy values of logistic 
regression with lasso regularization, Bayes logistic regression, decision tree, 
random forest, and XGBoost were 0.878, 0.883, 0.865, 0.883, and 0.882, 
respectively. Likewise, in the external validation set 1, lasso regularization = 
0.879, Bayes logistic regression = 0.877, decision tree = 0.865, random forest = 
0.886, and XGBoost = 0.875. In the external validation set 2, lasso 
regularization = 0.715, Bayes logistic regression = 0.745, decision tree = 
0.763, random forest = 0.760, and XGBoost = 0.699.
CONCLUSION: The top three models for internal validation set were Bayes logistic 
regression, random forest, and XGBoost, whereas the top three models for 
external validation set 1 were random forest, logistic regression, and Bayes 
logistic regression. In addition, the top three models for the external 
validation set 2 were decision tree, random forest, and Bayes logistic 
regression. Random forest model performed well with the training and three 
validation sets. The most important features are age, albumin, and lactate.

Immune cells and immunity are associated with the prognosis of patients with 
critical illness. Here, medical records retrospectively extracted from the 
Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care IV were used for screening an 
immune-related biomarker in intensive care units (ICU) patients and applied for 
validating the identified indicator in septic patients. In this work, the count 
of innate immune cells, basophils, harbored a superior role in predicting ICU 
patients' prognosis compared with those of other blood immune cells (OR 0.013, 
95% CI 0.001, 0.118, P < 0.001). Importantly, basophils absence during ICU stay 
was positively correlated with the 28-day mortality of ICU patients and served 
as an independent predictor of ICU patients' prognosis (OR 3.425, 95% CI 
3.717-3.165, P < 0.001). Moreover, the association between critical illness 
progression, poor outcome, and basophils absence was verified in septic 
patients. Subsequent investigations revealed the positive relationship between 
basophils absence and immunosuppression, and suggested the potential of 
basophils-mediated immunity in predicting the 28-day mortality of ICU patients. 
Collectively, we identify basophils absence during ICU stay as a novel and 
unfavorable indicator for evaluating the prognosis of ICU patients and 
recognizing a branch of ICU patients potentially suitable for intensified 
treatment and immunoenhancement therapy.

BACKGROUND: Fluid therapy is a cornerstone in the treatment of sepsis. Recently, 
the guidelines have recommended the combined administration that using 
crystalloids plus albumin for septic patients, but the optimal timing for 
albumin combined is still unclear. The objective of this study was to 
investigate the association of timing of albumin combined with 28-day mortality 
in patients with sepsis.
METHODS: We involved septic patients from the Medical Information Mart for 
Intensive Care (MIMIC)-IV database, and these patients were categorized into 
crystalloids group (crystalloids alone) and early combination group 
(crystalloids combined albumin at 0-24 h). The primary outcome was 28-day 
mortality. We used propensity score matching (PSM) to adjust confounding and 
restricted mean survival time (RMST) analysis was conducted to quantify the 
beneficial effect on survival due to the combination group.
RESULTS: We categorized 6597 and 920 patients in the "crystalloids alone" and 
"early combination", respectively. After PSM, compared to the crystalloids 
group, the combination group was associated with the increased survival among 
28-day (increased survival: 3.39 days, 95% CI 2.53-4.25; P < 0.001) after ICU 
admission. Patients who received albumin combination at the first 24-h was 
associated with prolonged LOS in ICU (10.72 days vs. 8.24 days; P < 0.001) but 
lower risk of 28-day mortality (12.5% vs 16.4%, P = 0.003) than those received 
crystalloids alone.
CONCLUSION: In septic patients, receiving albumin combined within the first 24-h 
after crystalloids administration was associated with an increment of survival 
in 28 days.

OBJECTIVES: Sepsis-associated encephalopathy (SAE) patients in the intensive 
care unit (ICU) and perioperative period are administrated supplemental oxygen. 
However, the correlation between oxygenation status with SAE and the target for 
oxygen therapy remains unclear. This study aimed to examine the relationship 
between oxygen therapy and SAE patients.
METHODS: Patients diagnosed with sepsis 3.0 in the intensive care unit (ICU) 
were enrolled. The data were collected from the Medical Information Mart for 
Intensive Care IV (MIMIC IV) database and the eICU Collaborative Research 
Database (eICU-CRD) database. The generalized additive models were adopted to 
estimate the oxygen therapy targets in SAE patients. The results were confirmed 
by multivariate Logistic, propensity score analysis, inversion 
probability-weighting, doubly robust model, and multivariate COX analyses. 
Survival was analyzed by the Kaplan-Meier method.
RESULTS: A total of 10055 patients from eICU-CRD and 1685 from MIMIC IV were 
included. The incidence of SAE patients was 58.43%. The range of PaO2 (97-339) 
mmHg, PaO2/FiO2 (189-619), and SPO2≥93% may reduce the incidence of SAE, which 
were verified by multivariable Logistic regression, propensity score analysis, 
inversion probability-weighting, and doubly robust model estimation in MIMIC IV 
database and eICU database. The range of PaO2/FiO2 (189-619) and SPO2≥93% may 
reduce the hospital mortality of SAE were verified by multivariable COX 
regression.
CONCLUSIONS: SAE patients in ICU, including perioperative period, require 
conservative oxygen therapy. We should maintain SPO2≥93%, PaO2 (97-339) mmHg and 
PaO2/FiO2 (189-619) in SAE patients.

This study aimed to investigate the association between serum magnesium 
trajectory and risk of in-hospital mortality in intensive care unit (ICU) 
patients with sepsis. Adult sepsis patients who had complete data on serum 
magnesium at ICU admission (at 0, 12, 24, 36 and 48 hours after ICU admission) 
based the 2012-2019 Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care IV (MIMIC-IV) 
database were included in this retrospective cohort study. Serum magnesium 
trajectories were identified using K-means cluster analysis. The multivariable 
Cox proportional-hazards model was used to evaluate the association between 
magnesium level at different time points or magnesium trajectory and in-hospital 
mortality. A total of 2,270 patients with sepsis were enrolled, and in-hospital 
mortality occurred in 716 (31.54%). Three trajectories were identified: a 
high-level declining trajectory, normal-level stable trajectory, and low-level 
rising trajectory. Among the magnesium levels at different time points, a higher 
serum magnesium level only at ICU admission (0h) (hazard ratio [HR] = 1.13, 95% 
confidence interval [CI]: 1.03-1.23) was associated with an increased risk of 
in-hospital mortality. Compared with the normal-level stable trajectory group, 
patients in the low-level rising trajectory group (HR = 0.82, 95%CI: 0.70-0.97) 
had a reduced risk of in-hospital mortality, but no association with in-hospital 
mortality was found in patients in the high-level declining trajectory group 
(p=0.812). Conclusion: Sepsis patients with a low-level, rising magnesium 
trajectory may have a reduced risk of in-hospital mortality.

BACKGROUND: Sepsis is one of the most life-threatening circumstances for 
critically ill patients in the United States, while diagnosis of sepsis is 
challenging as a standardized criteria for sepsis identification is still under 
development. Disparities in social determinants of sepsis patients can interfere 
with the risk prediction performances using machine learning.
METHODS: We analyzed a cohort of critical care patients from the Medical 
Information Mart for Intensive Care (MIMIC)-III database. Disparities in social 
determinants, including race, sex, marital status, insurance types and 
languages, among patients identified by six available sepsis criteria were 
revealed by forest plots with 95% confidence intervals. Sepsis patients were 
then identified by the Sepsis-3 criteria. Sixteen machine learning classifiers 
were trained to predict in-hospital mortality for sepsis patients on a training 
set constructed by random selection. The performance was measured by area under 
the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC). The performance of the 
trained model was tested on the entire randomly conducted test set and each 
sub-population built based on each of the following social determinants: race, 
sex, marital status, insurance type, and language. The fluctuations in 
performances were further examined by permutation tests.
RESULTS: We analyzed a total of 11,791 critical care patients from the MIMIC-III 
database. Within the population identified by each sepsis identification method, 
significant differences were observed among sub-populations regarding race, 
marital status, insurance type, and language. On the 5783 sepsis patients 
identified by the Sepsis-3 criteria statistically significant performance 
decreases for mortality prediction were observed when applying the trained 
machine learning model on Asian and Hispanic patients, as well as the 
Spanish-speaking patients. With pairwise comparison, we detected performance 
discrepancies in mortality prediction between Asian and White patients, Asians 
and patients of other races, as well as English-speaking and Spanish-speaking 
patients.
CONCLUSIONS: Disparities in proportions of patients identified by various sepsis 
criteria were detected among the different social determinant groups. The 
performances of mortality prediction for sepsis patients can be compromised when 
applying a universally trained model for each subpopulation. To achieve accurate 
diagnosis, a versatile diagnostic system for sepsis is needed to overcome the 
social determinant disparities of patients.

The prognosis of septic patients with cirrhosis is worse compared to septic 
patients without cirrhosis. Early and accurate prognosis determination in 
patients with cirrhosis and sepsis is pivotal for guiding treatment decisions. 
The aim of this study was to investigate the association between 
albumin-corrected anion gap (ACAG) and clinical prognosis of patients with 
sepsis and cirrhosis. This study extracted data of patients with sepsis and 
cirrhosis from the Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care (MIMIC-IV) 
database. A total of 1340 patients (64.6% male) were enrolled. After confounders 
adjusting, elevated ACAG had a significant association with 28-day mortality 
(HR1.604; 95% CI 1.258-2.048; P < 0.001). Restricted cubic spline revealed that 
a linear relationship between ACAG and 28-day mortality (P-nonlinear = 0.089, 
P-overall = 0.001). According to the ROC curve analysis, the ACAG demonstrated a 
higher area under the curve (AUC) of 0.703 compared to AG (0.675). Kaplan-Meier 
analysis revealed higher 28-day mortality in high ACAG group (log-rank test, 
χ^2 = 175.638, P < 0.001). Furthermore, subgroup analysis showed a significant 
interaction between ACAG and etiology of cirrhosis (P for interaction = 0.014). 
Therefore, ACAG could provide clinicians with valuable insights for guiding 
interventions in this high-risk population.

BACKGROUND: Sepsis-associated acute kidney injury (S-AKI) is a common and 
life-threatening complication in hospitalized and critically ill patients. This 
condition is an independent cause of death. This study was performed to 
investigate the correlation between the trajectory of urine output within 24 h 
and S-AKI.
METHODS: Patients with sepsis were studied retrospectively based on the Medical 
Information Mart for Intensive Care IV. Latent growth mixture modeling was used 
to classify the trajectory of urine output changes within 24 h of sepsis 
diagnosis. The outcome of this study is AKI that occurs 24 h after sepsis. Cox 
proportional hazard model, Fine-Gray subdistribution proportional hazard model, 
and doubly robust estimation method were used to explore the risk of AKI in 
patients with different trajectory classes.
RESULTS: A total of 9869 sepsis patients were included in this study, and their 
24-h urine output trajectories were divided into five classes. The Cox 
proportional hazard model showed that compared with class 1, the HR (95% CI) 
values for classes 3, 4, and 5 were 1.460 (1.137-1.875), 1.532 (1.197-1.961), 
and 2.232 (1.795-2.774), respectively. Competing risk model and doubly robust 
estimation methods reached similar results.
CONCLUSIONS: The trajectory of urine output within 24 h of sepsis patients has a 
certain impact on the occurrence of AKI. Therefore, in the early treatment of 
sepsis, close attention should be paid to changes in the patient's urine output 
to prevent the occurrence of S-AKI.

OBJECTIVE: The Acute Disease Quality Initiative (ADQI) working group recently 
released a consensus definition of sepsis-associated acute kidney injury 
(SA-AKI), but the prognosis and risk factors for early and late SA-AKI have not 
been studied.
METHODS: This was a retrospective cohort study based on the Medical Information 
Mart for Intensive Care IV (MIMIC-IV) database (v2.2). First, SA-AKI patients 
that met the new definition from the ADQI were screened, and then, the 
relationships between SA-AKI occurrence time and relevant clinical parameters 
were analyzed.
RESULTS: After propensity score matching, 1,090 early SA-AKI (AKI occurring 
within 48 h of sepsis diagnosis) cases and late SA-AKI (AKI occurring between 
48 h and 7 days after sepsis diagnosis) cases were identified. Compared with 
late SA-AKI patients, early SA-AKI patients had no significant differences in 
all-cause mortality at 28 days, 60 days or 180 days, renal replacement therapy 
(RRT) rates; or major adverse kidney events at 30 days (MAKE-30). However, the 
renal recovery of early SA-AKI patients was significantly better than that of 
late SA-AKI patients, their lengths of hospital stay and intensive care unit 
stay were significantly shorter, and the number of patients with positive fluid 
balance was lower, but the use of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) 
and nephrotoxic antibiotics and the incidence of septic shock were higher. In 
addition, there was a difference in the number of patients with early and late 
SA-AKI at highest AKI stages 1 and 3. Data analysis also revealed that liver 
disease, cancer, highest AKI stage 3 and septic shock were associated with renal 
nonrecovery.
CONCLUSIONS: Although there was no significant difference in mortality between 
early and late SA-AKI patients, there were significant differences in renal 
recovery, positive fluid balance, nephrotoxic antibiotic use, septic shock and 
AKI stage. Therefore, the classification of early and late SA-AKI has certain 
scientific and rational validity, but whether the two have different clinical 
outcomes and pathogeneses requires further study.

BACKGROUND: Sepsis-associated encephalopathy (SAE) is defined as diffuse brain 
dysfunction associated with sepsis and leads to a high mortality rate. We aimed 
to develop and validate an optimal machine-learning model based on clinical 
features for early predicting sepsis-associated acute brain injury.
METHODS: We analyzed adult patients with sepsis from the Medical Information 
Mart for Intensive Care (MIMIC III) clinical database. Candidate models were 
trained using random forest, support vector machine (SVM), decision tree 
classifier, gradients boosting machine (GBM), multiple layer perception (MLP), 
extreme gradient boosting (XGBoost), light gradients boosting machine (LGBM) and 
a conventional logistic regression model. These methods were applied to develop 
and validate the optimal model based on its accuracy and area under curve (AUC).
RESULTS: In total, 12,460 patients with sepsis met inclusion criteria, and 6,284 
(50.4%) patients suffered from sepsis-associated acute brain injury. Compared 
other models, the LGBM model achieved the best performance. The AUC for both 
train set and test set indicated excellent validity (Trainset AUC 0.91, Testset 
AUC 0.87). Feature importance analysis showed that glucose, age, mean arterial 
pressure, heart rate, hemoglobin, and length of ICU stay were the top 6 
important clinical factors to predict occurrence of sepsis-associated acute 
brain injury.
CONCLUSION: Almost half of patients admitted to ICU with sepsis had 
sepsis-associated acute brain injury. The LGBM model better identify patients 
with sepsis-associated acute brain injury than did other machine-learning 
models. Glucose, age, and mean arterial pressure were the three most important 
clinical factors to predict occurrence of sepsis-associated acute brain injury.

The high mortality rate in sepsis patients is related to sepsis-associated liver 
injury (SALI). We sought to develop an accurate forecasting nomogram to estimate 
individual 90-day mortality in SALI patients. Data from 34,329 patients 
were extracted from the public Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care 
(MIMIC-IV) database. SALI was defined by total bilirubin (TBIL) > 2 mg/dL and 
the occurrence of an international normalized ratio (INR) > 1.5 in the presence 
of sepsis. Logistic regression analysis was performed to establish a prediction 
model called the nomogram based on the training set (n = 727), which was 
subsequently subjected to internal validation. Multivariate logistic regression 
analysis showed that SALI was an independent risk factor for mortality in 
patients with sepsis. The Kaplan‒Meier curves for 90-day survival were different 
between the SALI and non-SALI groups after propensity score matching (PSM) (log 
rank: P < 0.001 versus P = 0.038), regardless of PSM balance. The nomogram 
demonstrated better discrimination than the sequential organ failure assessment 
(SOFA) score, logistic organ dysfunction system (LODS) score, simplified acute 
physiology II (SAPS II) score, and Albumin-Bilirubin (ALBI) score in the 
training and validation sets, with areas under the receiver operating 
characteristic curve (AUROC) of 0.778 (95% CI 0.730-0.799, P < 0.001) and 0.804 
(95% CI 0.713-0.820, P < 0.001), respectively. The calibration plot showed that 
the nomogram was sufficiently successful to predict the probability of 90-day 
mortality in both groups. The DCA of the nomogram demonstrated a higher net 
benefit regarding clinical usefulness than SOFA, LODS, SAPSII, and ALBI scores 
in the two groups. The nomogram performs exceptionally well in predicting the 
90-day mortality rate in SALI patients, which can be used to assess the 
prognosis of patients with SALI and may assist in guiding clinical practice to 
enhance patient outcomes.

OBJECTIVES: We aimed to evaluate the association between β-blocker therapy and 
mortality in patients with sepsis.
METHODS: Patients with sepsis were selected from the Medical Information Mart 
for Intensive Care (MIMIC)-III. Propensity score matching (PSM) was used to 
balance the baseline differences. A multivariate Cox regression model was used 
to assess the relationship between β-blocker therapy and mortality. The primary 
outcome was the 28-day mortality.
RESULTS: A total of 12,360 patients were included in the study, involving 3,895 
who received β-blocker therapy and 8,465 who did not. After PSM, 3,891 pairs of 
patients were matched. The results showed that β-blockers were associated with 
improved 28- (hazards ratio (HR) 0.78) and 90-day (HR 0.84) mortality. 
Long-acting β-blockers were associated with improved 28-day survival (757/3627 
[20.9%] vs. 583/3627 [16.1%], P < 0.001, HR0.76) and 90-day survival (1065/3627 
[29.4%] vs.921/3627 [25.4%], P < 0.001, HR 0.77). Short-acting β-blocker 
treatment did not reduce the 28-day and 90-day mortality (61/264 [23.1%] vs. 
63/264 [23.9%], P = 0.89 and 83/264 [31.4%] vs. 89/264 [31.7%], P = 0.8, 
respectively).
CONCLUSIONS: β-blockers were associated with improved 28- and 90-day mortality 
in patients with sepsis and septic shock. Long-acting β-blocker therapy may have 
a protective role in patients with sepsis, reducing the 28-day and 90-day 
mortality. However, short-acting β-blocker (esmolol) treatment did not reduce 
the mortality in sepsis.

BACKGROUND: Identifying sepsis patients with risk of in-hospital death early can 
improve the prognosis of patients. This study aimed to develop a model to 
predict in-hospital death of sepsis patients based on the Medical Information 
Mart for Intensive Care-Ⅲ (MIMIC-Ⅲ) database, and use clinical data to 
externally validate the model.
METHODS: A total of 1,839 sepsis patients were used for model development, and 
125 clinical cases were used for external validation. The discriminatory ability 
of the model was determined by calculating the area under the curve (AUC) with 
95% confidence intervals (CI).
RESULTS: The AUC of the random forest model and logistic regression model was 
0.754 (95%CI, 0.732-0.776) and 0.703 (95%CI, 0.680-0.727), respectively, and the 
random forest model had higher AUC (Z = 3.070, P = .002). External validation 
showed that the AUC of the random forest model was 0.539 (95%CI, 0.440-0.628). 
Further validation was carried out according to gender and SOFA score. The AUC 
of the model in males and females was 0.648 and 0.412, respectively. In 
addition, the AUC of the model in the population with SOFA scores of 3-8, 9-12, 
and 13-15 were 0.705, 0.495, and 0.769, respectively.
CONCLUSIONS: The random forest model had a better predictive ability and a good 
applicability to external populations with SOFA score of 13-15.

BACKGROUND Previous research has focused on poor outcomes from a lack of 
insurance, but the effects of different types of insurance for patients with 
sepsis in the intensive care unit (ICU) have not been well studied. We aimed to 
investigate whether private health insurance was better than government-run 
health insurance in the United States in terms of clinical outcomes of patients 
with sepsis in the ICU. MATERIAL AND METHODS Patients with sepsis were 
identified from the Medical information Mart for Intensive Care-III database. 
Patients were grouped as having private and government-run health insurance. 
Clinical outcomes were compared in univariate and multivariate analyses. 
Propensity score match (PSM) and subgroup analysis were used to check the 
robustness of results. RESULTS Data from 13,957 patients were extracted. After 
adjustment by multivariate model, the private insurance group had similar rates 
of ICU mortality (relative risk [RR] [95% confidence interval CI]=1.052 
[0.919-1.205], P=.463) and 90-day (RR [95% CI]=.964 [0.885-1.051], P=.406) 
compared with the group with government-run insurance. The private insurance 
group had longer ICU stays (strictly standardized mean difference=0.092, P<.001) 
and better long-term survival (hazard ratio [95% CI]=0.875 [0.825-0.928], 
P<.001) than the government-run insurance group in the PSM cohorts. Subgroup 
analysis indicated little variation in results for specific conditions. 
CONCLUSIONS Patients with sepsis who had private insurance had longer ICU stays 
but similar ICU mortality and 90-day mortality rates than similar patients with 
government-run insurance; they seemed to have better long-term survival, but 
more evidence may be required to support this conclusion.

OBJECT: Establish a clinical prognosis model of coronary heart disease (CHD) to 
predict 28-day mortality in patients with sepsis.
METHOD: The data were collected retrospectively from septic patients with a 
previous history of coronary heart disease (CHD) from the Medical Information 
Mart for Intensive Care (MIMIC)-III database. The included patients were 
randomly divided into the training cohorts and validation cohorts. The variables 
were selected using the backward stepwise selection method of Cox regression, 
and a nomogram was subsequently constructed. The nomogram was compared to the 
Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (SOFA) model using the C-index, area under 
the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) over time, Net 
reclassification index (NRI), Integrated discrimination improvement index (IDI), 
calibration map, and decision curve analysis (DCA).
RESULT: A total of 800 patients were included in the study. We developed a 
nomogram based on age, diastolic blood pressure (DBP), pH, lactate, red blood 
cell distribution width (RDW), anion gap, valvular heart disease, peripheral 
vascular disease, and acute kidney injury (AKI) stage. The nomogram was 
evaluated using C-index, AUC, NRI, IDI, calibration plot, and DCA. Our findings 
revealed that this nomogram outperformed the SOFA score in predicting 28-day 
mortality in sepsis patients.

BACKGROUND: To explore the association between myocardial enzymes and one-year 
mortality, and establish a nomogram integrating myocardial enzymes and clinical 
characteristics to predict one-year mortality among sepsis patients.
METHODS: Data of 1,983 sepsis patients were extracted from Medical Information 
Mart for Intensive Care III database in this retrospective cohort study. All 
participants were randomly split into the training set for the development of 
model and testing set for the internal validation at the ratio of 7:3. 
Univariate logistic regression was used to screen variables with statistical 
differences which were made for stepwise regression, obtaining the predictors 
associated with one-year mortality of sepsis patients. Adopted multivariate 
logistic regression to assess the relationship between myocardial enzymes and 
one-year mortality of sepsis patients. A nomogram was established in predicting 
the one-year survival status of sepsis patients, and the performance of 
developed model were compared with LDH alone, sequential organ failure 
assessment (SOFA), simplified acute physiology score II (SAPS II) by receiver 
operator characteristic, calibration, and decision curves analysis.
RESULTS: The result found that LDH was associated with one-year mortality of 
sepsis patients [odds ratio = 1.28, 95% confidence interval (CI): 1.18-1.52]. 
Independent predictors, including age, gender, ethnicity, potassium, calcium, 
albumin, hemoglobin, alkaline phosphatase, vasopressor, Elixhauser score, 
respiratory failure, and LDH were identified and used to establish the nomogram 
(LDH-model) for predicting one-year mortality for sepsis patients. The predicted 
performance [area under curve (AUC) = 0.773, 95%CI: 0.748-0.798] of this 
developed nomogram in the training and testing sets (AUC = 0.750, 95%CI: 
0.711-0.789), which was superior to that of LDH alone, SOFA score, SAPS II 
score. Additionally, calibration curve indicated that LDH-model may have a good 
agreement between the predictive and actual outcomes, while decision curve 
analysis demonstrated clinical utility of the LDH-model.
CONCLUSION: LDH level was related to the risk of one-year mortality in sepsis 
patients. A prediction model based on LDH and clinical features was developed to 
predict one-year mortality risk of sepsis patients, surpassing the predictive 
ability of LDH alone as well as conventional SAPS II and SOFA scoring systems.

BACKGROUND: Septic shock is a leading cause of death in intensive care units 
(ICUs), with short-term mortality rates of 35-40%. Vasopressin (AVP) is a 
second-line vasoactive agent for septic shock, and recent studies suggest that 
early AVP use can be beneficial. However, differences between early initiation 
of AVP combined with norepinephrine (NE) and nonearly AVP with NE are unclear. A 
retrospective cohort research was designed to explore the effects of early AVP 
initiation versus nonearly AVP initiation.
METHODS: This retrospective single-center cohort study included adult patients 
with septic shock from the MIMIC (Medical Information Mart for Intensive 
Care)-IV database. According to whether AVP was used early in the ICU (intensive 
care unit), patients were assigned to the early- (within 6 h of septic shock 
onset) and non-early-AVP (at least 6 h after septic shock onset) groups. The 
primary outcome was 28-day mortality. The secondary outcomes were ICU and 
hospital mortality, the numbers of vasopressor-free and ventilation-free days at 
28 days, ICU length of stay (LOS), hospital LOS, sequential organ failure 
assessment (SOFA) score on days 2 and 3, and renal replacement therapy (RRT) use 
on days 2 and 3. Univariate and multivariate cox proportional-hazards 
regression, propensity-score matching were used to analyze the differences 
between the groups.
RESULTS: The study included 531 patients with septic shock: 331 (62.5%) in the 
early-AVP group and 200 (37.5%) in the non-early-AVP group. For 1:1 matching, 
158 patients in the early-AVP group were matched with the same number of 
patients with nonearly AVP. Regarding the primary outcome, there was no 
significant difference between the early- and non-early-AVP groups in 28-day 
mortality (hazard ratio [HR] = 0.91, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 0.68-1.24). 
For the secondary outcomes, there were no differences between the early- and 
non-early-AVP groups in ICU mortality (HR = 0.95, 95% CI = 0.67-1.35), hospital 
mortality (HR = 0.95, 95% CI = 0.69-1.31), the numbers of vasopressor-free and 
ventilation-free days at 28 days, ICU LOS, hospital LOS, SOFA score on days 2 
and 3, and RRT use on days 2 and 3.
CONCLUSIONS: There was no difference in short-term mortality between early AVP 
combined with NE and nonearly AVP with NE in septic shock.

BACKGROUND: Sepsis is a recognized global health challenge that places a 
considerable disease burden on countries. Although there has been some progress 
in the study of sepsis, the mortality rate of sepsis remains high. The 
relationship between serum osmolality and the prognosis of patients with sepsis 
is unclear.
METHOD: Patients with sepsis who met the criteria in the Medical Information 
Mart for Intensive Care IV database were included in the study. Hazard ratios 
(HRs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were determined using multivariable Cox 
regression. The relationship between serum osmolality and the 28-day mortality 
risk in patients with sepsis was investigated using curve fitting, and 
inflection points were calculated.
RESULTS: A total of 13,219 patients with sepsis were enrolled in the study; the 
mean age was 65.1 years, 56.9 % were male, and the 28-day mortality rate was 
18.8 %. After adjusting for covariates, the risk of 28-day mortality was 
elevated by 99% (HR 1.99, 95%CI 1.74-2.28) in the highest quintile of serum 
osmolality (Q5 >303.21) and by 59% (HR 1.59, 95%CI 1.39-1.83) in the lowest 
quintile (Q1 ≤285.80), as compared to the reference quintile (Q3 291.38-296.29). 
The results of the curve fitting showed a U-shaped relationship between serum 
osmolality and the risk of 28-day mortality, with an inflection point of 286.9 
mmol/L.
CONCLUSION: There is a U-shaped relationship between serum osmolality and the 
28-day mortality risk in patients with sepsis. Higher or lower serum osmolality 
is associated with an increased risk of mortality in patients with sepsis. 
Patients with sepsis have a lower risk of mortality when their osmolality is 
285.80-296.29 mmol/L.

Sepsis triggers a harmful immune response due to infection, causing high 
mortality. Predicting sepsis outcomes early is vital. Despite machine learning's 
(ML) use in medical research, local validation within the Medical Information 
Mart for Intensive Care IV (MIMIC-IV) database is lacking. We aimed to devise a 
prognostic model, leveraging MIMIC-IV data, to predict sepsis mortality and 
validate it in a Chinese teaching hospital. MIMIC-IV provided patient data, 
split into training and internal validation sets. Four ML models logistic 
regression (LR), support vector machine (SVM), deep neural networks (DNN), and 
extreme gradient boosting (XGBoost) were employed. Shapley additive 
interpretation offered early and interpretable mortality predictions. Area under 
the ROC curve (AUROC) gaged predictive performance. Results were cross verified 
in a Chinese teaching hospital. The study included 27,134 sepsis patients from 
MIMIC-IV and 487 from China. After comparing, 52 clinical indicators were 
selected for ML model development. All models exhibited excellent discriminative 
ability. XGBoost surpassed others, with AUROC of 0.873 internally and 0.844 
externally. XGBoost outperformed other ML models (LR: 0.829; SVM: 0.830; DNN: 
0.837) and clinical scores (Simplified Acute Physiology Score II: 0.728; 
Sequential Organ Failure Assessment: 0.728; Oxford Acute Severity of Illness 
Score: 0.738; Glasgow Coma Scale: 0.691). XGBoost's hospital mortality 
prediction achieved AUROC 0.873, sensitivity 0.818, accuracy 0.777, specificity 
0.768, and F1 score 0.551. We crafted an interpretable model for sepsis death 
risk prediction. ML algorithms surpassed traditional scores for sepsis mortality 
forecast. Validation in a Chinese teaching hospital echoed these findings.

BACKGROUND: Septic shock is a lethal disease, and identifying high-risk patients 
through noninvasive and widely available biomarkers can help improve global 
outcomes. While the clinical impact of chloride levels on critically ill 
patients remains unclear, this study aims to investigate the association between 
hypochloremia and mortality following ICU admission among septic shock patients.
METHODS: This is an analysis of data stored in the databases of Medical 
Information Mart for Intensive Care IV (MIMIC-IV). The initial chloride levels 
were classified ashypochloremia, normal chloraemia, and hyperchloraemia. A 
multivariate logistic regression model was applied, adjusting for age, lactate, 
pH, PO2, urine volume, RDW, creatinine, and liver disease, to assess the 
association between the three categories of chloride levels and mortality.
RESULTS: Of 3726 patients included in the study, 470 patients (12.6%) had 
hypochloremia on ICU admission. During the follow-up period, 1120 (33.5%) 
patients died. Hypochloremia was significantly associated with increased 
mortality and the incidence of AKI after adjusting for several variables.
CONCLUSIONS: Hypochloremia is independently associated with higher hospital 
mortality, AKI incidence among septic shock patients. However, further 
high-quality research is necessary to establish the precise relationship between 
hypochloremia and septic shock prognosis.

BACKGROUND: Serum phosphate levels have been reported to be linked to the 
prognosis in critically ill patients. The purpose of this study was to analyze 
the impact of the trajectory of changes in serum phosphate levels on the 
short-term mortality risk in patients with sepsis.
METHODS: This retrospective cohort study used data on patients with sepsis from 
the 2008-2019 Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care IV (MIMIC-IV) 
database. Serum phosphate level trajectories were constructed using a latent 
growth mixture modeling (LGMM) based on four measurements of serum phosphate at 
six-hour intervals within 24 h of admission to the intensive care unit (ICU). 
The relationship between serum phosphate levels at ICU admission and serum 
phosphate level trajectories and the risk of 28-day mortality in patients with 
sepsis was analyzed using Cox regression models, and hazard ratio (HR) and 95% 
confidence interval (CI) were calculated.
RESULTS: Of these 1,703 patients with sepsis included, 566 (33.24%) died within 
28 days. The median serum phosphate levels of the patients were 4.10 (3.00, 
5.50) mg/dL. Four serum phosphate level trajectories were classified: 
normal-level-steady trend (trajectory 1), high-level-steady trend (trajectory 
2), high-level-decreasing trend (trajectory 3), and high-level-increasing trend 
(trajectory 4). High serum phosphate levels at admission were associated with a 
higher risk of 28-day mortality (HR = 1.05, 95%CI: 1.01-1.09) in patients with 
sepsis. For trajectories, trajectory 2 (HR = 1.27, 95%CI: 1.05-1.54) related to 
an increased risk of 28-day mortality compared with trajectory 1, whereas 
trajectory 4 (HR = 1.69, 95%CI: 0.99-2.91, P = 0.056) may be related. There was 
no significant difference in 28-day mortality between patients on trajectory 3 
and trajectory 1 (P = 0.280). Subgroup analyses demonstrated that patients with 
trajectory 2 were linked to a higher risk of 28-day mortality in different 
population subgroups (P < 0.05).
CONCLUSION: Stable trajectories of high serum phosphate levels are an important 
risk factor for short-term mortality in patients with sepsis.

BACKGROUND: Thrombocytopenia is commonly observed in patients with sepsis and is 
an independent risk factor for poor prognosis. However, the changes of platelet 
count caused by different pathogens can vary significantly. Our study aims to 
evaluate the quantitative changes in platelet count in response to various 
pathogens.
MATERIAL AND METHODS: We retrospectively analysed data of 3044 patients with 
sepsis from Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care (MIMIC, 2008-2019) 
database and prospectively collected data of 364 patients with sepsis from our 
local cohort of the Shandong Bloodstream Infection and Sepsis Collaboration 
Study (SBISC, 2020-2022). Propensity score matching (PSM) was employed to 
control for baseline differences in variables, except for the causative 
pathogen.
RESULTS: Multivariate logistic analyses of both original and PSM populations 
identified Candida, Escherichia, Klebsiella, and Serratia species posing a 
higher risk for thrombocytopenia compared to others. Restricted cubic spline 
(RCS) curves showed L- or U-shaped associations between platelet count and 
28-mortality with various cut-off values among different pathogens: ranging from 
96 × 109/L in Candida species - 190 × 109/L in Klebsiella species.
CONCLUSION: Our present findings indicate a pathogen-specific effect on platelet 
count, highlighting the importance of monitoring thrombocytopenia in patients 
infected with above microorganisms. Clinicians need to consider 
pathogen-specific thresholds when intervene on platelet count.

Plain Language Summary: This study validated the differential incidence of 
thrombocytopenia among various pathogens within two distinct 
populations.Candida, Escherichia, Klebsiella, and Serratia species were 
identified as having a notably higher risk of causing thrombocytopenia compared 
to other pathogens.We observed L- or U-shaped relationships between platelet 
counts and 28-day mortality in Candida species, Enterococcus species, 
Escherichia species, Enterobacter species, Staphylococcus species, and 
Klebsiella species with platelet count cutoff values of 96 × 109/L, 100 × 109/L, 
100 × 109/L, 146 × 109/L, 152 × 109/L, and 190 × 109/L, respectively.

Background: Sepsis-induced coagulopathy (SIC) denotes an increased mortality 
rate and poorer prognosis in septic patients. Objectives: Our study aimed to 
develop and validate machine-learning models to dynamically predict the risk of 
SIC in critically ill patients with sepsis. Methods: Machine-learning models 
were developed and validated based on two public databases named Medical 
Information Mart for Intensive Care (MIMIC)-IV and the eICU Collaborative 
Research Database (eICU-CRD). Dynamic prediction of SIC involved an evaluation 
of the risk of SIC each day after the diagnosis of sepsis using 15 predictive 
models. The best model was selected based on its accuracy and area under the 
receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC), followed by fine-grained 
hyperparameter adjustment using the Bayesian Optimization Algorithm. A compact 
model was developed, based on 15 features selected according to their importance 
and clinical availability. These two models were compared with Logistic 
Regression and SIC scores in terms of SIC prediction. Results: Of 11,362 
patients in MIMIC-IV included in the final cohort, a total of 6,744 (59%) 
patients developed SIC during sepsis. The model named Categorical Boosting 
(CatBoost) had the greatest AUC in our study (0.869; 95% CI: 0.850-0.886). 
Coagulation profile and renal function indicators were the most important 
features for predicting SIC. A compact model was developed with an AUC of 0.854 
(95% CI: 0.832-0.872), while the AUCs of Logistic Regression and SIC scores were 
0.746 (95% CI: 0.735-0.755) and 0.709 (95% CI: 0.687-0.733), respectively. A 
cohort of 35,252 septic patients in eICU-CRD was analyzed. The AUCs of the full 
and the compact models in the external validation were 0.842 (95% CI: 
0.837-0.846) and 0.803 (95% CI: 0.798-0.809), respectively, which were still 
larger than those of Logistic Regression (0.660; 95% CI: 0.653-0.667) and SIC 
scores (0.752; 95% CI: 0.747-0.757). Prediction results were illustrated by 
SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) values, which made our models clinically 
interpretable. Conclusions: We developed two models which were able to 
dynamically predict the risk of SIC in septic patients better than conventional 
Logistic Regression and SIC scores.

PURPOSE: Sepsis is one of the leading causes of morbidity and mortality 
worldwide with approximately 50 million annual cases. There is ongoing debate on 
the clinical benefit of hydrocortisone in the prevention of death in septic 
patients. Here we evaluated the association between hydrocortisone treatment and 
mortality in patients diagnosed with sepsis in a large-scale clinical dataset.
METHODS: Data from patients between 2008 and 2019 were extracted from the 
retrospective Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care IV (MIMIC-IV) 
database. Patients who received hydrocortisone after diagnosis were matched 
using propensity-score matching with patients who did not, to balance 
confounding (by indication and contraindication) factors between the groups. 
90-day mortality and survivors' length of hospital stay was compared between 
patients who did or did not receive hydrocortisone.
RESULTS: A total of 31,749 septic patients were included in the study (mean age: 
67, men: 57.3%, in-hospital mortality: 15.6%). 90-day mortality was higher among 
the 1802 patients receiving hydrocortisone when compared with the 6348 matched 
non-users (hazard ratio: 1.35, 95% CI: 1.24-1.47). Hydrocortisone treatment was 
also associated with increased in-hospital mortality (40.9% vs. 27.6%, 
p < 0.0001) and prolonged hospital stay in those who survived until discharge 
(median 12.6 days vs. 10.8 days, p < 0.0001). Stratification for age, gender, 
ethnicity, occurrence of septic shock, and the need for vasopressor drug 
administration such as (nor)epinephrine did not reveal sub-population(s) 
benefiting of hydrocortisone use.
CONCLUSION: Hydrocortisone treatment is associated with increased risk of death 
as well as prolonged hospital stay in septic patients. Although residual 
confounding (by indication) cannot be ruled out completely due to the 
observational nature of the study, the present study suggests clinical 
implication of hydrocortisone use in patients with sepsis.

As delayed treatment of septic shock can lead to an irreversible health state, 
timely identification of septic shock holds immense value. While numerous 
approaches have been proposed to build early warning systems, these approaches 
primarily focus on predicting the future risk of septic shock, irrespective of 
its precise onset timing. Such early prediction systems without consideration of 
timeliness fall short in assisting clinicians in taking proactive measures. To 
address this limitation, we establish a timely warning system for septic shock 
with data-task engineering, a novel technique regarding the control of data 
samples and prediction targets. Leveraging machine learning techniques and the 
real-world electronic medical records from the MIMIC-IV (Medical Information 
Mart for Intensive Care) database, our system, TEW3S (Timely Early Warning 
System for Septic Shock), successfully predicted 94% of all shock events with 
one true alarm for every four false alarms and a maximum lead time of 8 hours. 
This approach emphasizes the often-overlooked importance of prediction 
timeliness and may provide a practical avenue to develop a timely warning system 
for acute deterioration in hospital settings, ultimately improving patient 
outcomes.

BACKGROUND This study aimed to investigate the association between 
albumin-corrected anion gap (ACAG) and in-hospital mortality in 
sepsis-associated acute kidney injury (S-AKI). MATERIAL AND METHODS We conducted 
this retrospective study based on data from the Medical Information Mart for 
Intensive Care IV database, and assessed the prognostic capabilities of ACAG in 
comparison with albumin (ALB) and anion gap (AG) to predict in-hospital 
mortality of patients with S-AKI. Binomial logistic regression analysis was 
performed to identify whether ACAG was an independent risk factor for 
in-hospital mortality for the patients, and receiver operating characteristic 
(ROC) curves were plotted to clarify its efficacy in predicting in-hospital 
mortality. We also performed a decision curve analysis (DCA) to determine 
whether there were net clinical benefits for patients when ACAG was used to 
predict in-hospital mortality. RESULTS Binary logistic regression analysis 
showed that ACAG was an independent risk factor for in-hospital mortality in 
patients with S-AKI, with an area under the ROC (AUC) curve of 0.675 (moderate 
predictive value) for the prediction of in-hospital mortality, higher than that 
of ALB or AG alone, with the highest Youden's index (0.2675). The DCA 
substantiated the superiority of ACAG in net clinical benefits at various 
threshold probability, enhancing its clinical applicability. CONCLUSIONS The 
research emphasizes the potential of ACAG as a valuable predictive tool for 
in-hospital mortality in S-AKI patients, which is better than albumin and AG, 
encouraging its consideration in clinical practice.

This study aimed to investigate the relationship between serum phosphate levels, 
changes in serum phosphate levels, and 28-day mortality in patients with septic 
shock. In this retrospective study, data were collected from the Medical 
Information Mart for Intensive Care IV (MIMIC-IV) database between 2008 and 
2019. Patients were divided into three groups according to the tertiles of serum 
phosphate levels. Kaplan-Meier curves and log-rank test analyses were used for 
survival analysis. Multivariate logistic regression, and restricted cubic spline 
(RCS) curve were used to explore the association between serum phosphate, delta 
serum phosphate levels and 28-day mortality. In total, 3296 patients with septic 
shock were included in the study, and the 28-day mortality was 30.0%. Serum 
phosphate levels were significantly higher in the non-survivor group than in the 
survivor group. The Kaplan-Meier curves showed significant differences among the 
three groups. Multivariate logistic regression analysis and the RCS curve showed 
that serum phosphate levels were independently and positively associated with 
the 28-day mortality of septic shock. Non-survivors had higher delta serum 
phosphate levels than survivors. Survival analysis showed that patients with 
higher delta serum phosphate levels had higher 28-day mortality. A non-linear 
relationship was detected between delta serum phosphate and 28-day mortality 
with a point of inflection at - 0.3 mg/dL. Serum phosphate levels were 
positively and independently associated with 28-day mortality in septic shock. 
Delta serum phosphate level was a high-risk factor for patients with septic 
shock.

BACKGROUND: Septic shock is associated with increased mortality. Predicting 
mortality, including early prediction for septic shock patients in intensive 
care units (ICUs), remains an important challenge.
METHOD: We searched the Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care IV database. 
Odds ratios (ORs) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) of the relationships 
between shock index (SI), modified SI (MSI), and diastolic SI (DSI) of patients 
with septic shock requiring vasopressors and 3-day/in-hospital mortality were 
calculated using logistic regression models. The time-course changes of these 
parameters were compared between survivors and non-survivors. The performance of 
the different parameters was described by the area under the receiver operating 
characteristic (ROC) curve (AUC) and compared with DeLong analysis.
RESULTS: A total of 1266 patients with septic shock requiring vasopressors were 
identified. The 3-day mortality rate and in-hospital mortality rate were 8.7% 
and 23.5%, respectively. Multivariable logistic regression analysis showed 
significant associations between pre-vasopressor SI/MSI/DSI and 3-day mortality 
in patients with septic shock requiring vasopressors in fully adjusted models 
(Ps for trend < 0.01). The AUCs of pre-vasopressor SI, MSI, and DSI were 0.746, 
0.710, and 0.732 for 3-day mortality, respectively. There were significant 
differences in the time-course of SI, MSI, and DSI between survivors and 
non-survivors at 3-day/in-hospital mortality among patients with septic shock 
requiring vasopressors (repeated-measures ANOVA, inter-subjects difference 
P < 0.001).
CONCLUSION: Pre-vasopressor SI, MSI, and DSI values identified patients with 
septic shock requiring vasopressors who are at increased risk of early death. Of 
these easy-to-acquire values, SI and MSI show a comparatively better 
performance.

Background: Acute kidney injury (AKI) is a prevalent and serious complication 
among patients with sepsis-associated acute respiratory distress syndrome 
(ARDS). Prompt and accurate prediction of AKI has an important role in timely 
intervention, ultimately improving the patients' survival rate. This study aimed 
to establish machine learning models to predict AKI via thorough analysis of 
data derived from electronic medical records. Method: The data of eligible 
patients were retrospectively collected from the Medical Information Mart for 
Intensive Care III database from 2001 to 2012. The primary outcome was the 
development of AKI within 48 hours after intensive care unit admission. Four 
different machine learning models were established based on logistic regression, 
support vector machine, random forest, and extreme gradient boosting (XGBoost). 
The performance of all predictive models was evaluated using the area under 
receiver operating characteristic curve, precision-recall curve, confusion 
matrix, and calibration plot. Moreover, the discrimination ability of the 
machine learning models was compared with that of the Sequential Organ Failure 
Assessment (SOFA) model. Results; Among 1,085 sepsis-associated ARDS patients 
included in this research, 375 patients (34.6%) developed AKI within 48 hours 
after intensive care unit admission. Twelve predictive variables were selected 
and further used to establish the machine learning models. The XGBoost model 
yielded the most accurate predictions with the highest area under receiver 
operating characteristic curve (0.86) and accuracy (0.81). In addition, a novel 
shiny application based on the XGBoost model was established to predict the 
probability of developing AKI among patients with sepsis-associated ARDS. 
Conclusions: Machine learning models could be used for predicting AKI in 
patients with sepsis-associated ARDS. Accordingly, a user-friendly shiny 
application based on the XGBoost model with reliable predictive performance was 
released online to predict the probability of developing AKI among patients with 
sepsis-associated ARDS.

BACKGROUND: Aortic aneurysm (AA) patients after vascular surgery are at high 
risk of death, some of them need intensive care. Our aim was to develop a 
simplified model with baseline data within 24 hours of intensive care unit (ICU) 
admission to early predict mortality.
METHODS: Univariate analysis and least absolute shrinkage and selection operator 
were used to select important variables, which were then taken into logistic 
regression to fit the model. Discrimination and validation were used to evaluate 
the performance of the model. Bootstrap method was conducted to perform internal 
validation. Finally, decision clinical analysis curve was used to test the 
clinical usefulness of the model.
RESULTS: We obtained baseline data of 482 AA patients from Medical Information 
Mart for Intensive Care III database, 33 (6.8%) of whom died in ICU. Our final 
model contained three variables and was called SAB model based on initials of 
three items [Sepsis, Anion gap, Bicarbonate (SAB)]. Area under the curve of SAB 
was 0.904 (95% CI: 0.841-0.967) while brier score was 0.043 (95% CI: 
0.028-0.057). After internal validation, corrected area under the curve was 
0.898 and brier score was 0.045, which showed good prediction ability of SAB 
model. The model can be assessed on 
https://vascularmodel.shinyapps.io/AorticAneurysm/.
CONCLUSIONS: SAB model derived in this study can be easily used to predict 
in-ICU mortality of AA patients after surgery precisely.

This study was to preview the risk of 30-day mortality in sepsis patients using 
sentiment analysis. The clinical data of patients and nursing notes were 
collected from the Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care (MIMIC-III) 
database. The factors influencing 30-day mortality were analyzed using the Cox 
regression model. And, the prognostic index (PI) was estimated. The receiver 
operating characteristic (ROC) curve was used to determine the PI cut-off point 
and assess the prediction ability of the model. In total, 1844 of 3560 patients 
were eligible for the study, with a 30-day mortality of 37.58%. Multivariate Cox 
analysis showed that sentiment polarity scores, sentiment subjectivity scores, 
simplified acute physiology score (SAPS)-II, age, and intensive care unit (ICU) 
types were all associated with the risk of 30-day mortality (P < 0.05). In the 
preview of 30-day mortality, the area under the curve (AUC) of ROC was 0.78 
(95%CI: 0.74-0.81,P < 0.001) when the cut-off point of PI was 0.467. The 
documented notes from nurses were described for the first time. Sentiment scores 
measured in nursing notes are associated with the risk of 30-day mortality in

BACKGROUND: The relationship between the dynamic changes in insulin resistance 
(IR) and the prognosis of septic patients remains unclear. This study aims to 
investigate the correlation between the clinical subphenotype of IR represented 
by the triglyceride-glucose (TyG) index trajectory and the mortality rate among 
patients with sepsis.
METHODS: In this retrospective cohort study, we utilized data from septic 
patients within the Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care (MIMIC)-IV 
database version 2.0 to construct trajectories of the TyG index over 72 h. 
Subsequently, we computed the similarity among various TyG index trajectories 
with the dynamic time warping (DTW) algorithm and utilized the hierarchical 
clustering (HC) algorithm to demarcate distinct cluster and identified 
subphenotypes according to the trajectory trend. Subsequently, we assessed the 
mortality risk between different subphenotypes using analyses such as survival 
analysis and validated the robustness of the results through propensity score 
matching (PSM) and various models.
RESULTS: A total of 2350 patients were included in the study. Two trajectory 
trends: TyG index decreasing (n = 926) and TyG index increasing (n = 1424) were 
identified, which indicated corresponding to the clinical subphenotype of 
increased and alleviative IR respectively. The 28-day and in-hospital mortality 
for the increased IR group was 28.51% and 25.49% respectively. In comparison, 
patients in the alleviative IR group with a 28-day mortality of 23.54% and an 
in-hospital mortality of 21.60%. These subphenotypes exhibited distinct 
prognosis, time dependent Cox model showed the increased IR group with a higher 
28-day mortality [hazard ratio (HR): 1.07, 95% confidence interval (CI): 
1.02-1.12, P = 0.01] and in-hospital mortality [HR: 1.05, 95% CI: 1.00-1.11, 
P = 0.045] compared to the alleviative IR group. Sensitivity analyses with 
various models further validated the robustness of our findings.
CONCLUSION: Dynamic increase in the TyG index trajectory is associated with 
elevated mortality risk among patients with sepsis, which suggests that dynamic 
increased IR exacerbates the risk of poor outcomes in patients.

BACKGROUND: The application of sepsis subtypes to enhance personalized medicine 
in critically ill patients is hindered by the lack of validation across diverse 
cohorts and the absence of a simple classification model. We aimed to validate 
the previously identified SENECA clinical sepsis subtypes in multiple large ICU 
cohorts, and to develop parsimonious classifier models for δ-type adjudication 
in clinical practice.
METHODS: Data from four cohorts between 2008 and 2023 were used to assign α, β, 
γ and δ-type in patients fulfilling the Sepsis-3 criteria using clinical 
variables: (I) The Molecular diAgnosis and Risk stratification of Sepsis (MARS, 
n = 2449), (II) a contemporary continuation of the MARS study (MARS2, n = 2445) 
(III) the Dutch National Intensive Care Evaluation registry (NICE, n = 28,621) 
and (IV) the Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care including (MIMIC-IV, 
n = 18,661). K-means clustering using clinical variables was conducted to assess 
the optimal number of classes and compared to the SENECA subtypes. Parsimonious 
models were built in the SENECA derivation cohort to predict subtype membership 
using logistic regression, and validated in MARS and MIMIC-IV.
RESULTS: Among 52.226 patients with sepsis, the subtype distribution in MARS, 
MARS2 and NICE was 2-6% for the α-type, 1-5% for the β-type, 49-65% for the 
γ-type and 26-48% for the δ-type compared to 33%, 27%, 27% and 13% in the 
original SENECA derivation cohort, whereas subtype distribution in MIMIC-IV was 
more similar at 25%, 24%, 27% and 25%, respectively. In-hospital mortality rates 
were significantly different between the four cohorts for α, γ and δ-type 
(p < 0.001). Method-based validation showed moderate overlap with the original 
subtypes in both MARS and MIMIC-IV. A parsimonious model for all four subtypes 
had moderate to low accuracy (accuracy 62.2%), while a parsimonious classifier 
model with 3 variables (aspartate aminotransferase, serum lactate, and 
bicarbonate) had excellent accuracy in predicting the δ-type patients from all 
other types in the derivation cohort and moderate accuracy in the validation 
cohorts (MARS: area under the receiver operator characteristic curve (AUC) 0.93, 
95% CI [0.92-0.94], accuracy 85.5% [84.0-86.8%]; MIMIC-IV: AUC 0.86 [0.85-0.87], 
accuracy 82.9% [82.4-83.4%]).
CONCLUSIONS: The distribution and mortality rates of clinical sepsis subtypes 
varied between US and European cohorts. A three-variable model could accurately 
identify the δ-type sepsis patients.

BACKGROUND: Numerous studies have investigated the mean arterial pressure in 
patients with sepsis, and many meaningful results have been obtained. However, 
few studies have measured the systolic blood pressure (SBP) multiple times and 
established trajectory models for patients with sepsis with different SBP 
trajectories.
METHODS: Data from patients with sepsis were extracted from the Medical 
Information Mart for Intensive Care-III database for inclusion in a 
retrospective cohort study. Ten SBP values within 10 h after hospitalization 
were extracted, and the interval between each SBP value was 1 h. The SBP 
measured ten times after admission was analyzed using latent growth mixture 
modeling to construct a trajectory model. The outcome was in-hospital mortality. 
The survival probability of different trajectory groups was investigated using 
Kaplan-Meier (K-M) analysis, and the relationship between different SBP 
trajectories and in-hospital mortality risk was investigated using Cox 
proportional-hazards regression model.
RESULTS: This study included 3034 patients with sepsis. The median survival time 
was 67 years (interquartile range: 56-77 years). Seven different SBP 
trajectories were identified based on model-fit criteria. The in-hospital 
mortality rates of the patients in trajectory classes 1-7 were 25.5%, 40.5%, 
11.8%, 18.3%, 23.5%, 13.8%, and 10.5%, respectively. The K-M analysis indicated 
that patients in class 2 had the lowest probability of survival. Univariate and 
multivariate Cox regression analysis indicated that, with class 1 as a 
reference, patients in class 2 had the highest in-hospital mortality risk 
(P < 0.001). Subgroup analysis indicated that a nominal interaction occurred 
between age group and blood pressure trajectory in the in-hospital mortality 
(P < 0.05).
CONCLUSION: Maintaining a systolic blood pressure of approximately 140 mmHg in 
patients with sepsis within 10 h of admission was associated with a lower risk 
of in-hospital mortality. Analyzing data from multiple measurements and 
identifying different categories of patient populations with sepsis will help 
identify the risks among these categories.

BACKGROUND: The prognosis is poor when acute pancreatitis (AP) progresses to 
sepsis; therefore, it is necessary to accurately predict the probability of 
sepsis and develop a personalized treatment plan to reduce the disease burden of 
AP patients.
METHODS: A total of 1295 patients with AP and 43 variables were extracted from 
the Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care (MIMIC) IV database. The 
included patients were randomly assigned to the training set and to the 
validation set at a ratio of 7 : 3. The chi-square test or Fisher's exact test 
was used to test the distribution of categorical variables, and Student's t-test 
was used for continuous variables. Multivariate logistic regression was used to 
establish a prognostic model for predicting the occurrence of sepsis in AP 
patients. The indicators to verify the overall performance of the model included 
the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC), calibration 
curves, the net reclassification improvement (NRI), the integrated 
discrimination improvement (IDI), and a decision curve analysis (DCA).
RESULTS: The multifactor analysis results showed that temperature, phosphate, 
calcium, lactate, the mean blood pressure (MBP), urinary output, Glasgow Coma 
Scale (GCS), Charlson Comorbidity Index (CCI), sodium, platelet count, and 
albumin were independent risk factors. All of the indicators proved that the 
prediction performance and clinical profitability of the newly established 
nomogram were better than those of other common indicators (including SIRS, 
BISAP, SOFA, and qSOFA).
CONCLUSIONS: The new risk-prediction system that was established in this 
research can accurately predict the probability of sepsis in patients with acute 
pancreatitis, and this helps clinicians formulate personalized treatment plans 
for patients. The new model can reduce the disease burden of patients and can 
contribute to the reasonable allocation of medical resources, which is 
significant for tertiary prevention.

INTRODUCTION: This study aimed to develop and validate an interpretable 
machine-learning model based on clinical features for early predicting 
in-hospital mortality in critically ill patients with sepsis.
METHODS: We enrolled all patients with sepsis in the Medical Information Mart 
for Intensive Care IV (MIMIC-IV, v.1.0) database from 2008 to 2019. Lasso 
regression was used for feature selection. Seven machine-learning methods were 
applied to develop the models. The best model was selected based on its accuracy 
and area under curve (AUC) in the validation cohort. Furthermore, we employed 
the SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) method to illustrate the effects of the 
features attributed to the model, and to analyze how the individual features 
affect the output of the model, and to visualize the Shapley value for a single 
individual.
RESULTS: In total, 8,817 patients with sepsis were eligible for participation, 
the median age was 66.8 years (IQR, 55.9-77.1 years), and 3361 of 8817 
participants (38.1%) were women. After selection, 25 of a total 57 clinical 
parameters collected on day 1 after ICU admission remained associated with 
prognosis and were used for developing the machine-learning models. Among seven 
constructed models, the eXtreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost) model achieved the 
best performance with an AUC of 0.884 and an accuracy of 89.5% in the validation 
cohort. Feature importance analysis showed that Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) score, 
blood urea nitrogen, respiratory rate, urine output, and age were the top 5 
features of the XGBoost model with the greatest impact. Furthermore, SHAP force 
analysis illustrated how the constructed model visualized the individualized 
prediction of death.
CONCLUSIONS: We have demonstrated the potential of machine-learning approaches 
for predicting outcome early in patients with sepsis. The SHAP method could 
improve the interpretability of machine-learning models and help clinicians 
better understand the reasoning behind the outcome.

It has been demonstrated that lactate/albumin (L/A) ratio is substantially 
relevant to the prognosis of sepsis, septic shock, and heart failure. However, 
there is still debate regarding the connection between the L/A ratio and severe 
acute myocardial infarction (AMI). The aim of this study is to determine the 
prognostic role of L/A ratio in patients with severe AMI. Our retrospective 
study extracted data from the Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care III 
(MIMIC-III) database, included 1,134 patients diagnosed with AMI. Based on the 
tertiles of L/A ratio, the patients were divided into three groups: Tertile1 
(T1) group (L/A ratio<0.4063, n=379), Tertile2 (T2) group (0.4063≤L/A 
ratio≤0.6667, n =379), and Tertile3 (T3) group (L/A ratio>0.6667, n =376). Uni- 
and multivariate COX regression model were used to analyze the relationship 
between L/A ratio and 14-day, 28-day and 90-day all-cause mortality. Meanwhile, 
the restricted cubic spline (RCS) model was used to evaluate the effect of L/A 
ratio as a continuous variable. Higher mortality was observed in AMI patients 
with higher L/A ratio. Multivariate Cox proportional risk model validated the 
independent association of L/A ratio with 14-day all-cause mortality [hazard 
ratio (HR) 1.813, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.041-3.156 (T3 vs T1 group)], 
28-day all-cause mortality [HR 1.725, 95% CI 1.035-2.874 (T2 vs T1 group), HR 
1.991, 95% CI 1.214-3.266 (T3 vs T1 group)], as well as 90-day all-cause 
mortality [HR 1.934, 95% CI 1.176-3.183 (T2 vs T1 group), HR 2.307, 95% CI 
1.426-3.733 (T3 vs T1 group)]. There was a consistent trend in subgroup 
analysis. The Kaplan-Meier (K-M) survival curves indicated that patients with 
L/A ratio>0.6667 had the highest mortality. Even after adjusting the confounding 
factors, RCS curves revealed a nearly linearity between L/A ratio and 14-day, 
28-day and 90-day all-cause mortality. Meanwhile, the areas under the receiver 
operating characteristic (ROC) curve (AUC) of 14-day, 28-day and 90-day 
all-cause mortality were 0.730, 0.725 and 0.730, respectively. L/A ratio was 
significantly associated with 14-day, 28-day and 90-day all-cause mortality in 
critical patients with AMI. Higher L/A ratio will be considered an independent 
risk factor for higher mortality in AMI patients.

BACKGROUND: The external validity or "generalizability" of randomized controlled 
trials (RCTs) often needs be considered when making treatment decisions. We 
evaluate whether participants in large multicenter RCTs investigating sepsis 
were similar in age, disease severity, comorbidities, and mortality to the 
general population of sepsis patients.
METHODS: Using MEDLINE, PubMed, and the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled 
Trials, RCTs that enrolled 100 or more adult sepsis patients from two or more 
sites published from 01 January 2000 to 04 August 2019 were identified. The 
weighted mean age of trial participants was calculated as the main variable, and 
it was compared with the mean ages of the overall populations derived from the 
MIMIC database and the EICU database. Two researchers independently screened all 
abstracts and performed data extraction, then aggregated the data using a random 
effects model. Multiple linear regression was used to determine whether any 
factors were significantly associated with age disparities.
RESULTS: The mean age of the 60,577 participants in the 94 trials included in 
the analysis was significantly lower than those of the patients in the MIMIC and 
EICU databases (weighted mean age 62.28 years vs. 64.47 years for MIMIC and 
65.20 years for EICU; both p < 0.001). Trial participants were less likely to 
have known comorbidities such as diabetes (13.96% vs. 30.64% for MIMIC and 
35.75% for EICU; both p < 0.001). The weighted mortality rate in trial 
participants was higher than that in patients in the MIMIC and EICU databases 
(29.33% vs. 20.72% for MIMIC and 17.53% for EICU; both p < 0.001). Differences 
in age, severity score, and comorbidities remained statistically significant in 
sensitivity analyses. Multivariable regression suggested that commercially 
supported trials were more likely to include patients with higher severity 
scores (p = 0.002), but after adjustment for study region and sepsis diagnosis 
inclusion in such trials was not significantly associated with age.
CONCLUSIONS: On average, trial participants were younger than the general sepsis 
patient population. Commercial support influenced patient selection. Efforts to 
understand and address the above-described patient disparities are necessary to 
improve the generalizability of RCT results.

BACKGROUND The aim of this study was to assess the impact of norepinephrine 
(NE), norepinephrine plus vasopressin (NE+VAS) and dopamine in patients with 
sepsis and heart failure. MATERIAL AND METHODS Data were extracted from the 
Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care III database, v1.4. Adults aged >18 
years in an Intensive Care Unit (ICU) who had heart failure and took 
vasopressors were included. The patients were divided into 3 groups: NE, NE+VAS, 
and dopamine. Differences in survival, treatment time, and organ function among 
the 3 groups were compared. Propensity score matching (PSM) was used to screen 
for possible prognostic differences, and regression analysis was used to further 
analyze and predict prognoses. RESULTS A total of 1864 patients were included. 
There were significant differences among the 3 groups in 7-, 28-, and 90-day 
mortality after PSM. The 5-year survival rates among the 3 groups also were 
significantly different (P<0.001). After Cox regression analysis, NE+VAS was an 
independent risk factor affecting 5-year survival (P<0.001). After multiple 
linear regression, dopamine was the factor related to ICU and hospital lengths 
of stay. CONCLUSIONS Compared with NE or dopamine alone, NE+VAS can reduce 
survival in patients with sepsis and heart failure who need vasopressors. 
Compared with the other 2 treatment options, dopamine can shorten ICU and 
hospital stays for these patients.

OBJECTIVE: This study planned to analyse the association between ondansetron use 
within 24 hours before intensive care unit (ICU) admission to within 48 hours 
after ICU admission and the risk of sepsis in ICU patients.
DESIGN: A cohort study.
SETTING AND PARTICIPANTS: Data of 65 366 participants in Medical Information 
Mart for Intensive Care IV from ICU in the Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center.
PRIMARY AND SECONDARY OUTCOME MEASURES: Sepsis was the primary outcome, which 
indicated patients with documented or suspected infection and acute change in 
total Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (SOFA) score ≥2 points. In-hospital 
mortality was the secondary outcome.
RESULTS: There were 6737 patients with early ondansetron use. In total, 1646 
patients suffered sepsis. According to the data from multivariate cox regression 
model, compared with participants without early ondansetron use, the risk of 
sepsis was reduced in participants with early ondansetron use relative to those 
without HR (HR=0.84, 95% CI: 0.76 to 0.93). The risk of in-hospital mortality 
was reduced in those with early ondansetron use (HR=0.63, 95% CI: 0.55 to 0.72). 
Subgroup analysis revealed that the association between early ondansetron use 
and decreased risk of sepsis was significant in participants aged <65 years, 
men, not complicated with trauma, no surgery, systemic inflammatory response 
syndrome ≥2, Charlson Comorbidity Index ≥2, with ventilation use, without 
antibiotics use or without insulin use. In both patients with SOFA <3 or SOFA 
≥3, early ondansetron use was correlated with a reduced risk of sepsis.
CONCLUSION: Patients with early ondansetron use had lower odds of experiencing 
sepsis than patients without early ondansetron use, which might provide a 
reference for the management of sepsis in ICU patients.

BACKGROUND: Hip fracture is a prevalent and hazardous injury among the elderly 
population that often results in intensive care unit (ICU) admission due to 
various complications, despite advanced medical science. One common complication 
experienced in the ICU by elderly hip fracture patients is heart failure, which 
significantly impacts short-term survival rates. Currently, there is a deficit 
of adequate predictive models to forecast the short-term risk of death following 
heart failure for elderly hip fracture patients in the ICU. This study aims to 
identify independent risk factors for all-cause mortality within 30 days for 
elderly patients with hip fractures and heart failure while in the ICU in order 
to develop a predictive model.
METHOD: A total of 641 elderly patients with hip fractures combined with heart 
failure were recruited from the Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care IV 
dataset and randomized to the training and validation sets. The primary outcome 
was all-cause mortality within 30 days. The least absolute shrinkage and 
selection operator regression was used to reduce data dimensionality and select 
features. Multivariate logistic regression was used to build predictive models. 
Consistency index (C-index), receiver operating characteristic curve, and 
decision curve analysis (DCA) were used to measure the predictive performance of 
the nomogram.
RESULT: Our results showed that these variables including MCH, MCV, INR, 
monocyte percentage, neutrophils percentage, creatinine, and combined sepsis 
were independent factors for death within 30 days in elderly patients with hip 
fracture combined with heart failure in the ICU. The C-index was 0.869 (95% CI 
0.823-0.916) and 0.824 (95% CI 0.749-0.900) for the training and validation 
sets, respectively. The results of the area under the curve and decision curve 
analysis (DCA) confirmed that the nomogram performed well in predicting elderly 
patients with hip fractures combined with heart failure in the ICU.
CONCLUSION: We developed a new nomogram model for predicting 30-day all-cause 
mortality in elderly patients with hip fractures combined with heart failure in 
the ICU, which could be a valid and useful clinical tool for clinicians for 
targeted treatment and prognosis prediction.

Background: An early diagnosis model with clinical phenotype classification is 
key for the early identification and precise treatment of sepsis-associated 
acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). This study aimed to: 1) build a 
machine learning diagnostic model for patients with sepsis-associated ARDS using 
easily accessible early clinical indicators, 2) conduct rapid classification of 
clinical phenotypes in this population, and 3) explore the differences in 
clinical characteristics, outcomes, and treatment responses of different 
phenotypes. Methods: This study is based on data from the Telehealth Intensive 
Care Unit (eICU) and Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care IV (MIMIC-IV). 
We trained and tested the early diagnostic model of sepsis-associated ARDS 
patients in the eICU. We used key predictive indicators to cluster 
sepsis-associated ARDS patients and determine the characteristics and clinical 
outcomes of different phenotypes, as well to explore the differences of 
in-hospital mortality among different the positive end-expiratory pressure 
(PEEP) levels in different phenotypes. These results are verified in MIMIC-IV to 
evaluate whether they are repeatable. Results: Among the diagnostic models 
constructed in 19,249 sepsis patients and 5,947 sepsis-associated ARDS patients, 
the AdaBoost (Decision Tree) model achieved the best performance with an area 
under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) of 0.895, which is 
higher than that of the traditional Logistic Regression model (Z = -2.40,p = 
0.013), and the accuracy of 70.06%, sensitivity of 78.11% and specificity of 
78.74%. We simultaneously identified three sepsis-associated ARDS phenotypes. 
Cluster 0 (n = 3,669) had the lowest in-hospital mortality rate (6.51%) and 
fewer laboratory abnormalities (lower WBC (median:15.000 K/mcL), lower blood 
glucose (median:158.000 mg/dl), lower creatinine (median:1.200 mg/dl), lower 
lactic acid (median:3.000 mmol/L); p < 0.001). Cluster 1 (n = 1,554) had the 
highest in-hospital mortality rate (75.29%) and the most laboratory 
abnormalities (higher WBC (median:18.300 K/mcL), higher blood glucose 
(median:188.000 mg/dl), higher creatinine (median:2.300 mg/dl), higher lactic 
acid (median:3.900 mmol/L); p < 0.001). Cluster 2 (n = 724) had the most complex 
condition, with a moderate in-hospital mortality rate (29.7%) and the longest 
intensive care unit stay. In Clusters 0 and 1, patients with high PEEP had 
higher in-hospital mortality rate than those with low PEEP, but the opposite 
trend was seen in Cluster 2. These results were repeatable in 11,935 patients 
with sepsis and 2,699 patients with sepsis-associated ARDS patients in the 
MIMIC-IV cohort. Conclusion: A machine learning diagnostic model of 
sepsis-associated ARDS patients was established. Three phenotypes with different 
clinical features and outcomes were clustered, and these had different 
therapeutic responses. These findings are helpful for the early and rapid 
identification of sepsis-associated ARDS patients and their precise 
individualized treatment.

BACKGROUND: Autoimmune diseases (ADs) may be complicated by sepsis when 
intensive care unit (ICU) admission. But repeated sepsis among AD patients has 
not been studied yet. The aim of this study is to investigate the impact of 
repeated in-ICU sepsis on the 1-year overall-cause mortality, septic shock and 
in-ICU death of AD patients.
METHODS: Data of AD patients with sepsis retrieved from Medical Information Mart 
for Intensive Care IV (MIMIC-IV) database were divided into the single group and 
the repeated group according to the frequency of in-ICU sepsis. Propensity score 
matching was used to balance inter-group bias. Cox proportional hazard 
regression and sensitivity analysis were utilized to assess the variables on 
mortality.
RESULTS: The incidence of repeated in-ICU sepsis in baseline was 19.8%. The 
repeated in-ICU sepsis was a risk factor for 1-year overall-cause mortality 
among AD patients (adjusted hazard ratio [HR] = 1.50, 95% CI: 1.16-1.93, 
P = 0.002), with robust adjusted HRs by the adjustment for confounders in the 
sensitivity analysis (all P < 0.01). Maximum Sequential Organ Failure Assessment 
(Max SOFA), Charlson comorbidity index (CCI) and Simplified Acute Physiology 
Score-II (SAPS-II) were risk factors for 1-year overall-cause mortality among AD 
with repeated sepsis (Max SOFA: HR = 1.09, P = 0.002; CCI: HR = 1.08, P = 0.039; 
SAPS-II: HR = 1.03, P < 0.001).
CONCLUSIONS: Compared to single hit, repeated in-ICU sepsis was independently 
related to a higher risk of 1-year overall-cause mortality among AD patients. 
Assessment tools (Higher SOFA, CCI and SAPS-II scores) were closely linked to 
poor prognosis of AD with repeated sepsis and helped to reflect ill physical 
conditions for the patients.

OBJECTIVE: The influence of serum sodium level changes on septic patient 
survival after cardiopulmonary bypass surgery is not clear. We attempted to 
figure out the impact of serum sodium trajectory changes on the 30-day mortality 
rate of such patients.
METHODS: The Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care (MIMIC)-IV database was 
searched to gather patients who developed sepsis after cardiopulmonary bypass 
surgery. A group-based trajectory model (GBTM) was employed to determine the 
serum sodium trajectory within 72 h of ICU admission. Patients' survival 
differences between different trajectory groups were compared using Kaplan-Meier 
(K-M) survival curves. Cox regression models were further employed to explore 
the correlation between survival status and serum sodium trajectory.
RESULTS: 1,038 eligible patients were involved in this project. GBTM identified 
3 serum sodium trajectories, all showing a trend of initial decrease followed by 
an increase. K-M curve analysis uncovered a notable difference in 30-day 
survival status between Class 1 and Class 2 (Log-rank p = 0.039), while no 
obvious differences were observed between other groups. Cox hazard analysis 
revealed that in the three models adjusting for different covariates, Class 2 
was connected with the increased risk of survival (OR > 1, p < 0.05).
CONCLUSION: Higher serum sodium trajectory is linked with elevated 30-day death 
risk in septic patients following cardiopulmonary bypass surgery. Repressing 
high levels of serum sodium may be beneficial for patient survival.

BACKGROUND: This study applied machine learning (ML) algorithms to construct a 
model for predicting EN initiation for patients in the intensive care unit (ICU) 
and identifying populations in need of EN at an early stage.
METHODS: This study collected patient information from the Medical Information 
Mart for Intensive Care IV database. All patients enrolled were split randomly 
into a training set and a validation set. Six ML models were established to 
evaluate the initiation of EN, and the best model was determined according to 
the area under curve (AUC) and accuracy. The best model was interpreted using 
the Local Interpretable Model-Agnostic Explanations (LIME) algorithm and SHapley 
Additive exPlanation (SHAP) values.
RESULTS: A total of 53,150 patients participated in the study. They were divided 
into a training set (42,520, 80%) and a validation set (10,630, 20%). In the 
validation set, XGBoost had the optimal prediction performance with an AUC of 
0.895. The SHAP values revealed that sepsis, sequential organ failure assessment 
score, and acute kidney injury were the three most important factors affecting 
EN initiation. The individualized forecasts were displayed using the LIME 
algorithm.
CONCLUSION: The XGBoost model was established and validated for early prediction 
of EN initiation in ICU patients.

OBJECTIVE: Sepsis is a serious complication of acute cholangitis. We aimed to 
establish a nomogram for predicting the probability of sepsis in patients with 
acute cholangitis.
METHODS: Subjects were patients with acute cholangitis in the Medical 
Information Mart for Intensive Care database. Extraneous variables were excluded 
based on stepwise regression. The nomogram was established using logistic 
regression.
RESULTS: The predictive model comprised five variables: age (odds ratio [OR]: 
1.03, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.01–1.04), ventilator-support time (OR: 
1.004, 95% CI: 1.001–1.008), diabetes (OR: 10.74, 95% CI: 2.80–70.57), 
coagulopathy (OR: 2.92, 95% CI: 1.83–4.73) and systolic blood pressure (OR: 
0.62, 95% CI: 0.41–0.93). The areas under the receiver operating characteristic 
curve of the nomogram for the training and validation sets were 0.700 and 0.647, 
respectively. The Hosmer–Lemeshow goodness-of-fit test revealed high concordance 
between the predicted and observed probabilities for both the training and 
validation sets. The calibration plot also demonstrated good agreement between 
the predicted and observed outcomes for both the training and validation sets.
CONCLUSIONS: We developed and validated a risk-prediction model for sepsis in 
patients with acute cholangitis. Our results will be helpful for preventing 
sepsis in patients with acute cholangitis.

Septic shock with acute kidney injury (AKI) is common in critically ill 
patients. Our aim was to evaluate the association between albumin infusion and 
outcomes in patients with septic shock and AKI. Medical Information Mart for 
Intensive Care (MIMIC)-III was used to identify patients with septic shock and 
AKI. Propensity score matching (PSM) was employed to balance the baseline 
differences. Cox proportional hazards model, Wilcoxon rank-sum test, and 
logistic regression were utilized to determine the associations of albumin 
infusion with mortality, length of stay, and recovery of kidney function, 
respectively. A total of 2861 septic shock patients with AKI were studied, 
including 891 with albumin infusion, and 1970 without albumin infusion. After 
PSM, 749 pairs of patients were matched. Albumin infusion was associated with 
improved 28-day survival (HR 0.72; 95% CI 0.59-0.86; P = 0.002), but it was not 
difference in 90-day mortality between groups (HR 0.94; 95% CI 0.79-1.12; 
P = 0.474). Albumin infusion was not associated with the renal function recovery 
(HR 0.91; 95% CI 0.73-1.13; P = 0.393) in either population. Nevertheless, 
subgroup analysis showed that albumin infusion was distinctly associated with 
reduced 28-day mortality in patients with age > 60 years. The results need to be 
validated in more randomized controlled trials.

BACKGROUND: This study aimed to develop and validate an interpretable 
machine-learning model that utilizes clinical features and inflammatory 
biomarkers to predict the risk of in-hospital mortality in critically ill 
patients suffering from sepsis.
METHODS: We enrolled all patients diagnosed with sepsis in the Medical 
Information Mart for Intensive Care IV (MIMIC-IV, v.2.0), eICU Collaborative 
Research Care (eICU-CRD 2.0), and the Amsterdam University Medical Centers 
databases (AmsterdamUMCdb 1.0.2). LASSO regression was employed for feature 
selection. Seven machine-learning methods were applied to develop prognostic 
models. The optimal model was chosen based on its accuracy, F1 score and area 
under curve (AUC) in the validation cohort. Moreover, we utilized the SHapley 
Additive exPlanations (SHAP) method to elucidate the effects of the features 
attributed to the model and analyze how individual features affect the model's 
output. Finally, Spearman correlation analysis examined the associations among 
continuous predictor variables. Restricted cubic splines (RCS) explored 
potential non-linear relationships between continuous risk factors and 
in-hospital mortality.
RESULTS: 3535 patients with sepsis were eligible for participation in this 
study. The median age of the participants was 66 years (IQR, 55-77 years), and 
56% were male. After selection, 12 of the 45 clinical parameters collected on 
the first day after ICU admission remained associated with prognosis and were 
used to develop machine-learning models. Among seven constructed models, the 
eXtreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost) model achieved the best performance, with an 
AUC of 0.94 and an F1 score of 0.937 in the validation cohort. Feature 
importance analysis revealed that Age, AST, invasive ventilation treatment, and 
serum urea nitrogen (BUN) were the top four features of the XGBoost model with 
the most significant impact. Inflammatory biomarkers may have prognostic value. 
Furthermore, SHAP force analysis illustrated how the constructed model 
visualized the prediction of the model.
CONCLUSIONS: This study demonstrated the potential of machine-learning 
approaches for early prediction of outcomes in patients with sepsis. The SHAP 
method could improve the interoperability of machine-learning models and help 
clinicians better understand the reasoning behind the outcome.

This study aimed to establish and validate a machine learning (ML) model for 
predicting in-hospital mortality in patients with sepsis-associated acute kidney 
injury (SA-AKI). This study collected data on SA-AKI patients from 2008 to 2019 
using the Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care IV. After employing Lasso 
regression for feature selection, six ML approaches were used to build the 
model. The optimal model was chosen based on precision and area under curve 
(AUC). In addition, the best model was interpreted using SHapley Additive 
exPlanations (SHAP) values and Local Interpretable Model-Agnostic Explanations 
(LIME) algorithms. There were 8129 sepsis patients eligible for participation; 
the median age was 68.7 (interquartile range: 57.2-79.6) years, and 57.9% 
(4708/8129) were male. After selection, 24 of the 44 clinical characteristics 
gathered after intensive care unit admission remained linked with prognosis and 
were utilized developing ML models. Among the six models developed, the eXtreme 
Gradient Boosting (XGBoost) model had the highest AUC, at 0.794. According to 
the SHAP values, the sequential organ failure assessment score, respiration, 
simplified acute physiology score II, and age were the four most influential 
variables in the XGBoost model. Individualized forecasts were clarified using 
the LIME algorithm. We built and verified ML models that excel in early 
mortality risk prediction in SA-AKI and the XGBoost model performed best.

To establish a prediction model for the 30-day mortality in sepsis patients. The 
data of 1185 sepsis patients were extracted from the Medical Information Mart 
for Intensive Care III (MIMIC-III) and all participants were randomly divided 
into the training set (n = 829) and the testing set (n = 356). The model was 
established in the training set and verified in the testing set. After 
standardization of the data, age, gender, input, output, and variables with 
statistical difference between the survival group and the death group in the 
training set were involved in the extreme gradient boosting (XGBoost) model. 
Subgroup analysis was performed concerning age and gender in the testing set. In 
the XGBoost model with variables related to intravenous (IV) fluid management 
and electrolytes for the 30-day mortality of sepsis patients, the area under the 
curve (AUC) was 0.868 (95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.867-0.869) in the 
training set and 0.781 (95% CI: 0.779-0.782) in the testing set. The sensitivity 
was 0.815 (95% CI: 0.774-0.857) in the training set and 0.755 (95% CI: 
0.686-0.825) in the testing set. The specificity was 0.761 (95% CI: 0.723-0.798) 
in the training set, and 0.737 (95% CI: 0.677-0.797) in the testing set. In the 
XGBoost forest model without variables related to IV fluid management and 
electrolytes for the 30-day mortality of sepsis patients, in the training set, 
the AUC was 0.830 (95% CI: 0.829-0.831), the sensitivity was 0.717 (95% CI: 
0.669-0.765), the specificity was 0.797 (95% CI: 0.762-0.833), and the accuracy 
was 0.765 (95% CI: 0.736-0.794). In the testing set, the AUC was 0.751 (95% CI: 
0.750-0.753), the sensitivity was 0.612 (95% CI: 0.533-0.691), the specificity 
was 0.756 (95% CI: 0.698-0.814), and the accuracy was 0.697(95% CI: 
0.649-0.744). The prediction model including variables associated with IV fluids 
and electrolytes had good predictive value for the 30-day mortality of sepsis 
patients.

BACKGROUND: This study aimed to evaluate the association between the 
glucose-to-lymphocyte ratio (GLR) and in-hospital mortality in intensive care 
unit (ICUs) patients with sepsis.
METHODS: This is a retrospective cohort study. Patients with sepsis from the 
Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care-IV (MIMIC-IV) database had their 
baseline data and in-hospital prognosis retrieved. Multivariable Cox regression 
analyses were applied to calculate adjusted hazard ratios (HR) with 95% 
confidence intervals (CI). Survival curves were plotted, and subgroup analyses 
were stratified by relevant covariates. To address the non-linearity 
relationship, curve fitting and a threshold effect analysis were performed.
RESULTS: Of the 23,901 patients, 10,118 patients with sepsis were included. The 
overall in-hospital mortality rate was 17.1% (1,726/10,118). Adjusted for 
confounding factors in the multivariable Cox regression analysis models, when 
GLR was used as a categorical variable, patients in the highest GLR quartile had 
increased in-hospital mortality compared to patients in the lowest GLR quartile 
(HR = 1.26, 95% CI: 1.15-1.38). When GLR was used as a continuous variable, each 
unit increase in GLR was associated with a 2% increase in the prevalence of 
in-hospital mortality (adjusted HR = 1.02, 95% CI: 1.01-1.03, p = 0.001). 
Stratified analyses indicated that the correlation between the GLR and 
in-hospital mortality was stable. The non-linear relationship between GLR and 
in-hospital mortality was explored in a dose-dependent manner. In-hospital 
mortality increased by 67% (aHR = 1.67, 95% CI: 1.45-1.92) for every unit GLR 
increase. When GLR was beyond 1.68, in-hospital mortality did not significantly 
change (aHR: 1.04, 95% CI: 0.92-1.18).
CONCLUSION: There is a non-linear relationship between GLR and in-hospital 
mortality in intensive care patients with sepsis. A higher GLR in ICU patients 
is associated with in-hospital mortality in the United States. However, further 
research is needed to confirm the findings.

Modern Intensive Care Units (ICUs) provide continuous monitoring of critically 
ill patients susceptible to many complications affecting morbidity and 
mortality. ICU settings require a high staff-to-patient ratio and generates a 
sheer volume of data. For clinicians, the real-time interpretation of data and 
decision-making is a challenging task. Machine Learning (ML) techniques in ICUs 
are making headway in the early detection of high-risk events due to increased 
processing power and freely available datasets such as the Medical Information 
Mart for Intensive Care (MIMIC). We conducted a systematic literature review to 
evaluate the effectiveness of applying ML in the ICU settings using the MIMIC 
dataset. A total of 322 articles were reviewed and a quantitative descriptive 
analysis was performed on 61 qualified articles that applied ML techniques in 
ICU settings using MIMIC data. We assembled the qualified articles to provide 
insights into the areas of application, clinical variables used, and treatment 
outcomes that can pave the way for further adoption of this promising technology 
and possible use in routine clinical decision-making. The lessons learned from 
our review can provide guidance to researchers on application of ML techniques 
to increase their rate of adoption in healthcare.

INTRODUCTION: Sepsis is a leading cause of death. However, there is a lack of 
useful model to predict outcome in sepsis. Herein, the aim of this study was to 
develop an explainable machine learning (ML) model for predicting 28-day 
mortality in patients with sepsis based on Sepsis 3.0 criteria.
METHODS: We obtained the data from the Medical Information Mart for Intensive 
Care (MIMIC)-III database (version 1.4). The overall data was randomly assigned 
to the training and testing sets at a ratio of 3:1. Following the application of 
LASSO regression analysis to identify the modeling variables, we proceeded to 
develop models using Extreme Gradient Boost (XGBoost), Logistic Regression (LR), 
Support Vector Machine (SVM), and Random Forest (RF) techniques with 5-fold 
cross-validation. The optimal model was selected based on its area under the 
curve (AUC). Finally, the Shapley additive explanations (SHAP) method was used 
to interpret the optimal model.
RESULTS: A total of 5,834 septic adults were enrolled, the median age was 
66 years (IQR, 54-78 years) and 2,342 (40.1%) were women. After feature 
selection, 14 variables were included for developing model in the training set. 
The XGBoost model (AUC: 0.806) showed superior performance with AUC, compared 
with RF (AUC: 0.794), LR (AUC: 0.782) and SVM model (AUC: 0.687). SHAP summary 
analysis for XGBoost model showed that urine output on day 1, age, blood urea 
nitrogen and body mass index were the top four contributors. SHAP dependence 
analysis demonstrated insightful nonlinear interactive associations between 
factors and outcome. SHAP force analysis provided three samples for model 
prediction.
CONCLUSION: In conclusion, our study successfully demonstrated the efficacy of 
ML models in predicting 28-day mortality in sepsis patients, while highlighting 
the potential of the SHAP method to enhance model transparency and aid in 
clinical decision-making.

Our study focused on evaluating the effect of three common vasoactive drugs on 
the prognosis of elderly patients with sepsis and pre-existing heart failure. 
The Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care III database, Version 1.4, was 
used. Our study included critically ill older patients (aged ≥ 65 years) with 
sepsis and heart failure treated with vasoactive drugs. Patients were divided 
into norepinephrine group, norepinephrine combined with vasopressin group, and 
dopamine group. The baseline characteristics, primary outcome, and secondary 
outcome measures were compared among the three groups. In total, 1357 elderly 
patients were included (766 in norepinephrine group, 250 in norepinephrine 
combined with vasopressin group, and 341 in dopamine group). After propensity 
score matching, statistically significant differences in 28-d and 90-d mortality 
(P = 0.046, P = 0.031) were observed; meanwhile, there was a significant 
difference in the incidence of mechanical ventilation, AKI, and malignant 
arrhythmias. Cox regression analysis revealed that norepinephrine combined with 
vasopressin decreased 5-year survival statistically(P = 0.001). Multiple linear 
regression analysis indicated dopamine as an independent risk factor in reducing 
ICU and hospital length of stay (P = 0.001, P = 0.017). Logistic regression 
analysis showed dopamine was an independent risk factor for new-onset 
arrhythmias (P < 0.001), while norepinephrine combined with vasopressin was an 
independent risk factor for new-onset malignant arrhythmias (P < 0.001). 
Norepinephrine in combination with vasopressin decreased survival and increased 
the incidence of malignant arrhythmias in elderly sepsis patients with 
pre-existing heart failure. Dopamine alone reduces ICU and hospital length of 
stay but increases the new-onset arrhythmias.

OBJECTIVES: To identify the clinical risk factors that influence in-hospital 
mortality in elderly patients with persistent sepsis-associated acute kidney 
injury (S-AKI) and to establish and validate a nomogram to predict in-hospital 
mortality.
DESIGN: Retrospective cohort analysis.
SETTING: Data from critically ill patients at a US centre between 2008 and 2021 
were extracted from the Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care (MIMIC)-IV 
database (V.1.0).
PARTICIPANTS: Data from 1519 patients with persistent S-AKI were extracted from 
the MIMIC-IV database.
PRIMARY OUTCOME: All-cause in-hospital death from persistent S-AKI.
RESULTS: Multiple logistic regression revealed that gender (OR 0.63, 95% CI 
0.45-0.88), cancer (2.5, 1.69-3.71), respiratory rate (1.06, 1.01-1.12), AKI 
stage (2.01, 1.24-3.24), blood urea nitrogen (1.01, 1.01-1.02), Glasgow Coma 
Scale score (0.75, 0.70-0.81), mechanical ventilation (1.57, 1.01-2.46) and 
continuous renal replacement therapy within 48 hours (9.97, 3.39-33.9) were 
independent risk factors for mortality from persistent S-AKI. The consistency 
indices of the prediction and the validation cohorts were 0.780 (95% CI: 
0.75-0.82) and 0.80 (95% CI: 0.75-0.85), respectively. The model's calibration 
plot suggested excellent consistency between the predicted and actual 
probabilities.
CONCLUSIONS: This study's prediction model demonstrated good discrimination and 
calibration abilities to predict in-hospital mortality of elderly patients with 
persistent S-AKI, although it warrants further external validation to verify its 
accuracy and applicability.

BACKGROUND: The benefits of platelet thresholds for transfusion remain unclear. 
This study assessed the effect of two transfusion thresholds on the survival 
outcomes of patients with sepsis and thrombocytopenia.
METHODS: In this retrospective cohort study, data of patients with sepsis 
admitted to an intensive care unit (ICU) and who had received platelet 
transfusion were extracted from the Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care 
IV database. Patients were classified into the lower-threshold group (below 
20,000/μL) and higher-threshold group (20,000-50,000/μL), based on thresholds 
calculated from their pretransfusion platelet count. The endpoints included 28- 
and 90-day mortality, red blood cell (RBC) transfusion, ICU-free days, and 
hospital-free days.
RESULTS: There were 76 and 217 patients in the lower-threshold and 
higher-threshold groups, respectively. The higher-threshold group had a higher 
rate of surgical ICU admission (35.0% vs. 9.2%) and lower quick Sequential Organ 
Failure Assessment (qSOFA) score than the lower-threshold group. In the 
higher-threshold group, 94 (43.3%) and 132 (60.8%) patients died within 28 and 
90 days, compared to 51 (67.1%) and 63 (82.9%) patients in the lower-threshold 
group (adjusted odds ratio, 1.96; 95% confidence interval, 1.16 to 3.03; 
P = 0.012; adjusted odds ratio, 2.04; 95% confidence interval, 1.16 to 3.57; 
P = 0.012, respectively). After stratification by mortality risk, the subgroup 
analysis showed a consistent trend favoring higher-threshold transfusion but 
reached statistical significance only in the low-risk group. There were no 
differences in red blood cell transfusion, ICU-free days, and hospital-free days 
between the groups. The E-value analysis suggested robustness to unmeasured 
confounding.
CONCLUSIONS: In patients with sepsis and thrombocytopenia, platelet transfusion 
at a higher threshold was associated with a greater reduction in the 28- and 
90-day mortalities than that at a lower threshold.

OBJECTIVE: The effectiveness of antithrombotic drugs for treating sepsis is 
controversial. Here, we explore the association between antithrombotic therapy 
and intensive care unit (ICU) mortality for septic patients with peripheral 
vascular disease.
METHODS: This retrospective cohort study uses data from the Medical Information 
Mart for Intensive Care (MIMIC)-III database. Kaplan-Meier survival analyses 
were used to examine mortality among different groups. Cox regression and 
marginal structural Cox models (MSCMs) were used to adjust for confounding 
factors. Main Results. The final cohort from the MIMIC-III database included 776 
patients, of which 701 survived and 75 perished. The anticoagulant (AC) group 
and the antiplatelet-anticoagulation (AC-AP) group survived better than the 
group without antithrombotic treatment (non-AT). The AC and AC-AP groups showed 
a 0.363-fold and 0.373-fold risk of ICU mortality, respectively, compared with 
the non-AT group when controlling for age, gender, CRRT, alcohol, heart failure, 
hypertension, diabetes, obesity, renal failure, liver disease, INR, PT, PPT, and 
SpO2. Antiplatelet therapy did not reduce ICU mortality. The same trends were 
apparent from the MSCM. In addition, the AC-AP group exhibited a lower risk of 
bleeding complications.
CONCLUSION: Although the antithrombotic group (AC and AC-AP groups) demonstrated 
a higher sequential organ failure assessment (SOFA) score than the group without 
antithrombotic treatment (non-AT group), the risk of ICU mortality was lower 
without increasing the risk of bleeding complications. Our study further 
suggested that anticoagulation therapy may benefit the prognosis of septic 
patients with peripheral vascular disease.

BACKGROUND: Observational research suggests that individuals with dementia who 
have sepsis face a higher likelihood of death. However, whether there is a 
causal relationship between the two remains unknown.
METHODS: We analyzed data from patients diagnosed with sepsis and dementia, 
extracted from the Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care IV (MIMIC-IV) 
database. To examine the correlation between dementia and 28-day mortality in 
sepsis, we utilized Cox proportional hazards models. Following this, we 
performed a Mendelian randomization (MR) study with two samples to investigate 
the potential link between dementia and mortality within 28 days in sepsis.
RESULTS: This study included a total of 22,189 patients diagnosed with sepsis, 
among whom 1,346 cases (6.1%) had dementia. After adjusting for multiple 
confounding factors, dementia was associated with an increased risk of 28-day 
mortality in sepsis (HR = 1.25, 95% CI = 1.12-1.39, p < 0.001). In the MR 
analysis, there appeared to be a causal relationship between genetically 
predicted dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB) (OR = 1.093, 95% CI = 1.016-1.177, p = 
0.017) and 28-day mortality in sepsis. However, there was no evidence of 
causality between any dementia (OR = 1.063, 95% CI = 0.91-1.243, p = 0.437), 
Alzheimer's disease (AD) (OR = 1.126, 95% CI = 0.976-1.299, p = 0.103), vascular 
dementia (VD) (OR = 1.008, 95% CI = 0.93-1.091, p = 0.844), and the risk of 
28-day mortality in sepsis.
CONCLUSION: In the observational analysis, dementia was associated with an 
increased risk of 28-day mortality in septic patients. However, in the MR 
analysis, only DLB was associated with increased 28-day mortality in septic 
patients, with no observed correlation for other dementia subtypes.

BACKGROUND: The Albumin-Bilirubin (ALBI) score, recommended for assessing the 
prognosis of hepatocellular carcinoma patients, has garnered attention. The 
efficacy of ALBI score in forecasting the risk of death in sepsis patients 
remains limited. We designed two cohort studies to assess the association 
between ALBI score and in-hospital mortality in patients with sepsis.
METHODS: A retrospective analysis was conducted utilizing data from the Second 
Affiliated Hospital of Guangzhou Medical University and the Medical Information 
Mart for Intensive Care IV(MIMIC-IV). Patients diagnosed with sepsis were 
included in the analysis. The primary outcome was the in-hospital mortality. 
Multivariate Cox regression analysis was conducted to assess the independent 
association between the ALBI score and mortality, with adjustment for potential 
confounders. Subgroup analysis was conducted to assess the robustness of the 
findings.
RESULTS: The Guangzhou Sepsis Cohort (GZSC) of the Second Affiliated Hospital of 
Guangzhou Medical University comprised 2969 participants, while the MIMIC-IV 
database included 8841 participants. The ALBI score were categorized 
into < -2.60, -2.60∼-1.39, and >-1.39. After adjusting for confounders, a linear 
relationship was observed between ALBI score and mortality. Patients with a high 
ALBI grade were associated with higher in-hospital mortality in both the GZSC 
(HR: 1.52, 95%CI: 1.24-1.87, p < 0.001) and the MIMIC-IV database (HR: 1.57, 
95%CI: 1.46-1.70, p < 0.001).
CONCLUSIONS: A high ALBI score is associated with higher in-hospital mortality 
among sepsis patients in ICU.

BACKGROUND: There is no evidence to determine the association between the 
lactate dehydrogenase to albumin ratio (LAR) and the development of 
sepsis-associated acute kidney injury (SAKI). We aimed to investigate the 
predictive impact of LAR for SAKI in patients with sepsis.
METHODS: A total of 4,087 patients with sepsis from the Medical Information Mart 
for Intensive Care IV (MIMIC IV) database were included. Logistic regression 
analysis was used to identify the association between LAR and the risk of 
developing SAKI, and the relationship was visualized using restricted cubic 
spline (RCS). The clinical predictive value of LAR was evaluated by ROC curve 
analysis. Subgroup analysis was used to search for interactive factors.
RESULTS: The LAR level was markedly increased in the SAKI group (p < 0.001). 
There was a positive linear association between LAR and the risk of developing 
SAKI (p for nonlinearity = 0.867). Logistic regression analysis showed an 
independent predictive value of LAR for developing SAKI. The LAR had moderate 
clinical value, with an AUC of 0.644. Chronic kidney disease (CKD) was 
identified as an independent interactive factor. The predictive value of LAR for 
the development of SAKI disappeared in those with a history of CKD but remained 
in those without CKD.
CONCLUSIONS: Elevated LAR 12 h before and after the diagnosis of sepsis is an 
independent risk factor for the development of SAKI in patients with sepsis. 
Chronic comorbidities, especially the history of CKD, should be taken into 
account when using LAR to predict the development of AKI in patients with 
sepsis.

INTRODUCTION: Although their importance has gained attention, the clinical 
applications of methods for screening patients at high risk of sepsis after 
abdominal surgery have been restricted. Therefore, we aimed to develop and 
validate models for screening patients at high risk of sepsis after abdominal 
surgery based on machine learning with routine variables.
MATERIAL AND METHODS: The whole dataset was composed of three representative 
academic hospitals in China and the Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care 
IV (MIMIC-IV) database. Routine clinical variables were implemented for model 
development. The Boruta algorithm was applied for feature selection. Afterwards, 
ensemble learning and eight other conventional algorithms were used for model 
fitting and validation based on all features and selected features. The area 
under the receiver operating characteristic curves (ROC AUC), sensitivity, 
specificity, F1 score, accuracy, net reclassification index (NRI), integrated 
discrimination improvement (IDI), decision curve analysis (DCA), and calibration 
curves were used for model evaluation.
RESULTS: A total of 955 patients undergoing abdominal surgery were finally 
analyzed (sepsis: 285, non-sepsis: 670). After feature selection, the ensemble 
learning model constructed by integrating k-Nearest Neighbor (KNN) and Support 
Vector Machine (SVM) yielded the ROC AUC of 0.892 (0.841-0.944) and accuracy of 
85.0% on the test data, and the ROC AUC of 0.782 (0.727-0.838) and accuracy of 
68.1% on the validation data, which performed best. Albumin, ASA score, 
neutrophil-lymphocyte ratio, age, and glucose were the top features associated 
with postoperative sepsis by KNN and SVM.
CONCLUSIONS: We developed a new and potential generalizable model to 
preoperatively screen patients at high risk of sepsis after abdominal surgery, 
with the advantages of a representative training cohort and routine variables.

BACKGROUND: Recent studies have shown that anticoagulant therapy has 
heterogeneous treatment effects on patients with sepsis-induced coagulopathy 
(SIC).
AIMS: To identify the latent phenotypes of patients with SIC.
STUDY DESIGN: Retrospective cohort study.
METHODS: We obtained data of patients with SIC from the Medical Information Mart 
for Intensive Care IV database. SIC subphenotypes were identified by latent 
class analysis (LCA) and K-means clustering. Clinical and laboratory variables 
were obtained in patients who met the diagnostic criteria for SIC. The baseline 
characteristics of the patients and the association between the heterogeneity of 
anticoagulant therapy and clinical outcomes (28-day and in-hospital mortality) 
were compared between the subphenotypes.
RESULTS: We identified 4,993 patients with SIC. The LCA and K-means clustering 
analysis robustly identified three subphenotypes of SIC. Class 1 patients (n = 
1,808) had the lowest blood cell counts (leukocytes, erythrocytes, and 
platelets). Class 2 patients (n = 1,157) had severe coagulopathy with a high 
prothrombin time and international normalized ratio, multiple-organ dysfunction, 
high lactate, sequential organ failure assessment score, and mortality. Class 3 
(n = 2,028) were older, had more comorbidities, a higher fibrinogen 
concentration, and lower plasma and platelet infusion rates. After variable 
adjustments, heparin therapy reduced the 28-day mortality (odds ratio [OR] 0.39, 
0.30-0.49, p < 0.001) and in-hospital mortality (OR 0.42, 0.33-0.53, p < 0.001) 
only in class 2.
CONCLUSION: Three SIC subphenotypes were defined using clinical findings and 
laboratory variables. The effects of heparin treatment differ between the 
subphenotypes. This finding will facilitate the identification of target 
patients with SIC who should receive anticoagulant therapy.

Acute myocardial infarction (AMI) and sepsis are the leading causes of high 
mortality rates in intensive care units. While sepsis frequently affects the 
cardiovascular system, distinguishing between sepsis-induced cardiomyopathy and 
AMI remains challenging due to overlapping biomarkers. Misdiagnosis can hinder 
timely treatment and increase risk of complications. This study used 
multidimensional clinical data and machine learning techniques to develop and 
validate a novel predictive model for identifying AMI in critically ill patients 
with sepsis. Data from patients with sepsis were extracted from the Medical 
Information Mart for Intensive Care-IV database. Six machine learning algorithms 
were employed for model construction. Additionally, the machine learning-based 
models were compared with traditional scoring systems. Model performance was 
evaluated in terms of discrimination, calibration, and clinical applicability. 
In total, 2,103 critically ill patients with sepsis were included, 459 (21.8%) 
of whom experienced AMI during hospitalization. A total of 26 variables were 
selected for model construction. Among all models, the Gradient Boosting 
Classifier model demonstrated the best predictive performance in terms of 
discrimination, calibration, and clinical applicability. Machine learning models 
have the potential to serve as tools for predicting AMI in patients with sepsis. 
The Gradient Boosting Classifier model developed herein demonstrated promising 
predictive performance, supporting clinicians in identifying patients at 
high-risk of sepsis and implementing early interventions to reduce mortality 
rates.

BACKGROUND: Sepsis is a common cause of mortality in critically ill patients, 
and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is one of the most common 
comorbidities in septic patients. However, the impact of COPD on patients with 
sepsis remained unclear. Therefore, the purpose of this study aimed to assess 
the effect of COPD on the prognosis of septic patients based on Medical 
Information Mart for Intensive Care (MIMIC-III) database.
METHODS: In this retrospective study based on the (MIMIC)-III database version 
1.4 (v1.4), we collected clinical data and 28-day all-cause mortality from 
patients with sepsis in intensive care unit (ICU) and these patients met the 
diagnostic criteria of Sepsis 3 on ICU admission between 2008 and 2012. 
International Classification of Diseases (ICD-9) (4660, 490, 4910, 4911, 49120, 
49121, 4918, 4919, 4920, 4928, 494, 4940, 4941, 496) was used to identified 
COPD. We applied Kaplan-Meier analysis to compare difference of 28-day all-cause 
mortality between septic patients with and without COPD. Cox 
proportional-hazards model was applied to explore the risk factor associated 
with 28-day all-cause mortality in patients with sepsis.
RESULTS: Six thousand two hundred fifty seven patients with sepsis were included 
in this study, including 955 (15.3%) patients with COPD and 5302 patients 
without COPD (84.7%). Compared with patients without COPD, patients with COPD 
were older (median: 73.5 [64.4, 82.0] vs 65.8 [52.9, 79.1], P < 0.001), had 
higher simplified acute physiology score II (SAPSII) (median: 40.0 [33.0, 49.0] 
vs 38.0 [29.0,47.0], P < 0.001) and greater proportion of mechanical ventilatory 
support (MV) (55.0% vs 48.9%, P = 0.001). In our study, septic patients with 
COPD had higher 28-day all-cause mortality (23.6% vs 16.4%, P < 0.001) than 
patients without COPD. After adjusting for covariates, the results showed that 
COPD was an independent risk factor for the 28-day all-cause mortality of 
patients with sepsis (HR 1.30, 95%CI: 1.12-1.50, P = 0.001).
CONCLUSIONS: COPD was an independent risk factor of 28-day all-cause mortality 
in septic patients. Clinically, septic patients with COPD should be given 
additional care.

Backgrounds: Anticoagulation in sepsis-associated disseminated intravascular 
coagulation (DIC) remains uncertain. The aim of this study was to investigate 
whether unfractioned heparin (UFH) could improve clinical outcomes in patients 
with sepsis-induced coagulopathy (SIC). Methods: Septic patients with SIC were 
identified from the Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care (MIMIC)-III 
database. Cox-proportional hazards model, logistic regression model and linear 
regression were used to assess the associations between UFH administration and 
28-day mortality, hospital mortality, occurrence of bleeding complications and 
length of stay, respectively. Propensity score matching (PSM) analysis was used 
to match the imbalance between patients in the UFH group and the control group. 
Patients were further stratified according to SIC score and Simplified Acute 
Physiology Score II (SAPS II). Results: A total of 1,820 septic patients with 
SIC were included in the data analysis. After PSM, 652 pairs of patients were 
matched between the patients in the UFH group and the control group. UFH was 
significantly associated with reduced 28-day mortality (HR, 0.323, 95% CI, 
0.258-0.406; p < 0.001) and hospital mortality (HR, 0.380, 95% CI, 0.307-0.472; 
p < 0.001) without increasing the risks of intracranial hemorrhage (OR, 1.480, 
95% CI, 0.955-2.294; p = 0.080) or gastrointestinal bleeding (OR, 1.094, 95% CI, 
0.503-2.382; p = 0.820). For subgroup analysis, it didn't change the favorable 
results of UFH on mortality and UFH didn't increase the risk of hemorrhage in 
patients with severe disease. Conclusions: The analysis of MIMIC-III database 
indicated that anticoagulant therapy with UFH may be associated with a survival 
benefit in patients with SIC.

INTRODUCTION: The association between thiamine use and clinical outcomes among 
patients with sepsis and alcohol use disorder (AUD) is unclear.
METHODS: In this retrospective cohort study of patients from Medical Information 
Mart for Intensive Care III (MIMIC-III, version 1.4), we evaluated the 
association of thiamine use with clinical outcomes in patients with AUD and 
sepsis. The primary outcome was 28-day survival, and secondary outcomes included 
ICU, in-hospital, and 90-day mortality, ICU and hospital length of stay, 
duration of vasopressor use, need and duration of continuous renal replacement 
therapy (CRRT), and dynamic changes for variables up to day 7 after ICU 
admission.
RESULTS: A total of 944 patients with sepsis and AUD were included in this 
cohort [median age, 53.1 years; women, 26.0% (245 of 944)]. Among all patients, 
24.6% (233 of 944) received thiamine with a dose of 200 mg (IQR 100-345 mg). The 
28-day mortality was 11.2% (26 of 233) in the thiamine use group compared with 
18.6% (132 of 711) in the no thiamine use group (P = 0.009). After adjustment 
for a series of confounders, the mixed-effects Cox proportional hazards models 
showed that administration of thiamine was associated with a lower risk of 
28-day mortality compared with no administration of thiamine.
CONCLUSIONS: In critically ill patients with alcohol use disorder admitted for 
sepsis, treatment with thiamine may be associated with a decreased risk of 
death. However, the present results should be interpreted with caution due to 
the limitations of retrospective design. Additional larger, multicenter 
randomized controlled trials are needed to confirm our findings.

Background: Many severity scores are widely used for clinical outcome prediction 
for critically ill patients in the intensive care unit (ICU). However, for 
patients identified by sepsis-3 criteria, none of these have been developed. 
This study aimed to develop and validate a risk stratification score for 
mortality prediction in sepsis-3 patients. Methods: In this retrospective cohort 
study, we employed the Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care III (MIMIC 
III) database for model development and the eICU database for external 
validation. We identified septic patients by sepsis-3 criteria on day 1 of ICU 
entry. The Least Absolute Shrinkage and Selection Operator (LASSO) technique was 
performed to select predictive variables. We also developed a sepsis mortality 
prediction model and associated risk stratification score. We then compared 
model discrimination and calibration with other traditional severity scores. 
Results: For model development, we enrolled a total of 5,443 patients fulfilling 
the sepsis-3 criteria. The 30-day mortality was 16.7%. With 5,658 septic 
patients in the validation set, there were 1,135 deaths (mortality 20.1%). The 
score had good discrimination in development and validation sets (area under 
curve: 0.789 and 0.765). In the validation set, the calibration slope was 0.862, 
and the Brier value was 0.140. In the development dataset, the score divided 
patients according to mortality risk of low (3.2%), moderate (12.4%), high 
(30.7%), and very high (68.1%). The corresponding mortality in the validation 
dataset was 2.8, 10.5, 21.1, and 51.2%. As shown by the decision curve analysis, 
the score always had a positive net benefit. Conclusion: We observed moderate 
discrimination and calibration for the score termed Sepsis Mortality Risk Score 
(SMRS), allowing stratification of patients according to mortality risk. 
However, we still require further modification and external validation.

OBJECTIVE: Sepsis is a major contributor of intensive care units (ICUs) patient 
mortality. Prior investigations claimed that obesity enhances overall survival 
(OS) of septic patients. However, the reported results were inconsistent. This 
study examined the association between obesity and the 1-year mortality of 
septic patients.
DESIGN: A retrospective cohort study.
SETTING: The Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care III database.
PARTICIPANTS: 3145 septic patients were separated into three distinct cohorts, 
based on their WHO body mass index (BMI) status.
OUTCOMES: Our primary endpoint was the 1-year mortality from the date of ICU 
hospitalization.
RESULT: 1334 (42.4%) died within 1 year. The 1-year mortality rate was low in 
obese patients (38.8%), compared with normal (46.9%) and overweight (42.1%) 
patients. Crude assessment revealed that obese patients experienced reduced 
1-year mortality, relative to normal weight patients (HR 0.79, 95% CI 0.69 to 
0.9, p<0.001). However, once adjusted for baseline variables and comorbidities, 
no correlation was found between obesity and the 1-year mortality (HR 0.93, 
95% CI 0.81 to 1.06, p=0.28) of septic patients. There was an association among 
diabetic (HR 0.72, 95% CI 0.56 to 0.93, p=0.012) and hypertensive (HR 0.73, 
95% CI 0.58 to 0.92, p=0.008) patients, and among males (HR 0.71, 95% CI 0.59 to 
0.86, p<0.001), with obese individuals experiencing the lowest mortality rate. 
Given these evidences, the interactions between BMI and mortality in diabetic 
(p=0.031) and hypertensive (p=0.035) patients were significant.
CONCLUSION: In our study, obese diabetic and hypertensive patients associated to 
less sepsis-related mortality risk, compared with normal weight patients. 
Further researches were need to validated.

OBJECTIVE: To investigate the prescription rate of short-term systemic use of 
glucocorticoids during hospitalization in patients with cardiogenic shock (CS), 
and outcomes related with glucocorticoid use.
METHODS: We extracted patients' information from the Medical Information Mart 
for Intensive Care IV version 2.0 (MIMIC-IV v2.0) database. The primary endpoint 
was 90-day all-cause mortality. Secondary safety endpoints were infection 
identified by bacterial culture and at least one episode of hyperglycemia after 
ICU admission. Propensity score matching (PSM) was used to balance baseline 
characteristics. The difference in cumulative mortality rate between these 
treated with and without glucocorticoids was assessed by Kaplan-Meier curve with 
log-rank test. Independent risk factors for endpoints were identified by Cox or 
Logistic regression analysis.
RESULTS: A total of 1528 patients were enrolled, and one-sixth of these patients 
received short-term systemic therapy of glucocorticoids during hospitalization. 
These conditions, including rapid heart rate, the presence of rheumatic disease, 
chronic pulmonary disease and septic shock, high lactate level, the requirements 
of mechanical ventilation and continuous renal replacement therapy, were 
associated with an increase in glucocorticoid administration (all P ≤ 0.024). 
During a follow-up of 90 days, the cumulative mortality rate in patients treated 
with glucocorticoids was significantly higher than that in these untreated with 
glucocorticoids (log-rank test, P < 0.001). Multivariable Cox regression 
analysis showed that glucocorticoid use (hazard ratio 1.48, 95% confidence 
interval [CI] 1.22-1.81; P < 0.001) was independently associated with an 
increased risk for 90-day all-cause mortality. This result was consistent 
irrespective of age, gender, the presence of myocardial infarction, acute 
decompensated heart failure and septic shock, and inotrope therapy, but was more 
evident in low-risk patients as assessed by ICU scoring systems. Additionally, 
multivariable Logistic regression analysis showed that glucocorticoid exposure 
was an independent predictor of hyperglycemia (odds ratio 2.14, 95% CI 
1.48-3.10; P < 0.001), but not infection (odds ratio 1.23, 95% CI 0.88-1.73; 
P = 0.221). After PSM, glucocorticoid therapy was also significantly related 
with increased risks of 90-day mortality and hyperglycemia.
CONCLUSIONS: Real-world data showed that short-term systemic use of 
glucocorticoids was common in CS patients. Importantly, these prescriptions were 
associated with increased risks of adverse events.

Sepsis is a major cause of mortality among hospitalized patients. Existing 
sepsis prediction methods face limitations due to their reliance on laboratory 
results and Electronic Medical Records (EMRs). This work aimed to develop a 
sepsis prediction model utilizing continuous vital signs monitoring, offering an 
innovative approach to sepsis prediction. Data from 48,886 Intensive Care Unit 
(ICU) patient stays were extracted from the Medical Information Mart for 
Intensive Care -IV dataset. A machine learning model was developed to predict 
sepsis onset based solely on vital signs. The model's efficacy was compared with 
the existing scoring systems of SIRS, qSOFA, and a Logistic Regression model. 
The machine learning model demonstrated superior performance at 6 hrs prior to 
sepsis onset, achieving 88.1% sensitivity and 81.3% specificity, surpassing 
existing scoring systems. This novel approach offers clinicians a timely 
assessment of patients' likelihood of developing sepsis.

Objectives: We attempted to identify and validate the subphenotypes of 
sepsis-associated liver dysfunction (SALD) using routine clinical information. 
Design: This article is a retrospective observational cohort study. Setting: We 
used the Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care IV database and the eICU 
Collaborative Research Database. Patients: We included adult patients (age ≥18 
years) who developed SALD within the first 48 hours of intensive care unit (ICU) 
admission. We excluded patients who died or were discharged from the ICU within 
the first 48 hours of admission. Patients with abnormal liver function before 
ICU admission were also excluded. Measurements and Main Results: Patients in the 
MIMIC-IV 1.0 database served as a derivation cohort. Patients in the eICU 
database were used as validation cohort. We identified four subphenotypes of 
SALD (subphenotype α, β, γ, δ) using K-means cluster analysis in 5234 patients 
in derivation cohort. The baseline characteristics and clinical outcomes were 
compared between the phenotypes using one-way analysis of 
variance/Kruskal-Wallis test and the χ 2 test. Moreover, we used line charts to 
illustrate the trend of liver function parameters over 14 days after ICU 
admission. Subphenotype α (n = 1,055) was the most severe cluster, characterized 
by shock with multiple organ dysfunction (MODS) group. Subphenotype β (n = 
1,179) had the highest median bilirubin level and the highest proportion of 
patients with underlying liver disease and coexisting coagulopathy (increased 
bilirubin group). Subphenotype γ (n = 1,661) was the cluster with the highest 
mean age and had the highest proportion of patients with chronic kidney disease 
(aged group). Subphenotype δ (n = 1,683) had the lowest 28-day and in-hospital 
mortality (mild group). The characteristics of clusters in the validation cohort 
were similar to those in the derivation cohort. In addition, we were surprised 
to find that GGT levels in subphenotype δ were significantly higher than in 
other subphenotypes, showing a different pattern from bilirubin. Conclusions: We 
identified four subphenotypes of SALD that presented with different clinical 
features and outcomes. These results can provide a valuable reference for 
understanding the clinical characteristics and associated outcomes to improve 
the management of patients with SALD in the ICU.

BACKGROUND: Septic shock patients fundamentally require delicate vasoactive and 
inotropic agent administration, which could be quantitatively and objectively 
evaluated by the vasoactive-inotropic score (VIS); however, whether the dynamic 
trends of high-time-resolution VIS alter the clinical outcomes remains unclear. 
Thus, this study proposes the term VIS Reduction Rate (VRR) to generalise the 
tendency of dynamic VIS, to explore the association of VRR and mortality for 
patients with septic shock.
METHODS: We applied dynamic and static VIS data to predict ICU mortality by two 
models: the long short-term memory (LSTM) deep learning model, and the extreme 
gradient boosting (XGBoost), respectively. The specific target cohort was 
extracted from the Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care IV (MIMIC-IV) 
database by the sophisticated structured query language (SQL). Enrolled patients 
were divided into four groups by VRR value: ≥50%, 0 ~ 50%, -50% ~ 0, and < -50%. 
Statistical approaches included pairwise propensity score matching (PSM), Cox 
proportional hazards regression, and two doubly robust estimation models to 
ensure the robustness of the results. The primary and secondary outcomes were 
ICU mortality and in-hospital mortality, respectively.
RESULTS: VRR simplifies the dosing trends of vasoactive and inotropic agents 
represented by dynamic VIS data while requiring fewer data. In total, 8,887 
septic shock patients were included. Compared with the VRR ≥50% group, the 
0 ~ 50%, -50% ~ 0, and < -50% groups had significantly higher ICU mortality 
[hazard ratio (HR) 1.32, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.17-1.50, p < 0.001; HR 
1.79, 95% CI 1.44-2.22, p < 0.001; HR 2.07, 95% CI 1.61-2.66, p < 0.001, 
respectively] and in-hospital mortality [HR 1.43, 95% CI 1.28-1.60, p < 0.001; 
HR 1.75, 95% CI 1.45-2.11, p < 0.001; HR 2.00, 95% CI 1.61-2.49, p < 0.001, 
respectively]. Similar findings were observed in two doubly robust estimation 
models.
CONCLUSION: The trends of dynamic VIS in ICU might help intensivists to stratify 
the prognosis of adult patients with septic shock. A lower decline of VIS was 
remarkably associated with higher ICU and in-hospital mortality among septic 
shock patients receiving vasoactive-inotropic therapy for more than 24 h.

BACKGROUND: Propofol and midazolam are commonly used sedative drugs in 
mechanically ventilated patients in the Intensive Care Unit (ICU). However, 
there is still a lack of relevant studies exploring the influence of midazolam 
and propofol on the prognosis of patients with Sepsis-associated Acute Kidney 
Injury (S-AKI).
PATIENTS AND METHODS: A statistical analysis was conducted on 3,745 patients 
with S-AKI in the Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care IV database. The 
patients' baseline characteristics were grouped based on the use of either 
propofol or midazolam as sedatives. Cox proportional hazards models, logistic 
regression models, and subgroup analyses were used to compare the effects of 
propofol and midazolam on the short-term prognosis of S-AKI patients, including 
30-day mortality, ICU mortality, and duration of mechanical ventilation.
RESULTS: In the statistical analysis, a total of 3,745 patients were included, 
with 649 patients using midazolam and 3,096 patients using propofol. In terms of 
the 30-day mortality, compared to patients using midazolam, S-AKI patients using 
propofol had a lower ICU mortality (hazard ratio = 0.62, 95% confidence 
interval: 0.52-0.74, p < 0.001), lower 30-day mortality (hazard ratio = 0.56, 
95% confidence interval: 0.47-0.67, p < 0.001), and shorter mechanical 
ventilation time (odds ratio = 0.72, 95% confidence interval: 0.59-0.88, 
p < 0.001). Kaplan-Meier curves showed lower survival probabilities in the 
midazolam group (p < 0.001). Subgroup analyses showed that propofol was strongly 
protective of short-term prognosis in older, male, smaller SOFA score CCI score, 
no heart failure, and comorbid chronic kidney disease patients with S-AKI.
CONCLUSION: Compared to midazolam, propofol was considered a protective factor 
for short-term mortality risk and ICU mortality risk in S-AKI patients. 
Additionally, S-AKI patients using propofol had a lower risk of requiring 
prolonged mechanical ventilation. Overall, propofol may be more beneficial for 
the short-term prognosis of S-AKI patients compared to midazolam.

BACKGROUND: Using History and Physical Examination (H&P) notes, we investigated 
potential racial differences in documented chief complaints and problems among 
sepsis patients admitted to the intensive care unit.
METHODS: Patient records from Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care 
(MIMIC-III) dataset indicating a diagnosis of sepsis were included. First 
recorded clinical notes for each hospital admission were assessed; free text 
information was specifically extracted on (1) chief complaints, and (2) problems 
recorded in the Assessment & Plan (A&P) section. The top 10 for each were 
compared between Black and White patients.
RESULTS: In initial H&P notes of 17 434 sepsis patients (n = 1229 Black and 
n = 9806 White), the top 10 most common chief complaints were somewhat similar 
between Black and White patients. However, relative differences existed in terms 
of ranking, specifically for altered mental status which was more commonly 
reported in Black versus White patients (11.7% vs 7.8% P < .001). Among text in 
the A&P, sepsis was documented significantly less frequently among Black versus 
White patients: 11.8% versus 14.3%, P = .001. Racial differences were not 
detected in vital signs and laboratory values.
CONCLUSIONS: This analysis supports the hypothesis that there may be racial 
differences in early sepsis presentation and possible provider interpretation of 
these complaints.

Sepsis is a major health concern with global estimates of 31.5 million cases per 
year. Case fatality rates are still unacceptably high, and early detection and 
treatment is vital since it significantly reduces mortality rates for this 
condition. Appropriately designed automated detection tools have the potential 
to reduce the morbidity and mortality of sepsis by providing early and accurate 
identification of patients who are at risk of developing sepsis. In this paper, 
we present "LiSep LSTM"; a Long Short-Term Memory neural network designed for 
early identification of septic shock. LSTM networks are typically well-suited 
for detecting long-term dependencies in time series data. LiSep LSTM was 
developed using the machine learning framework Keras with a Google TensorFlow 
back end. The model was trained with data from the Medical Information Mart for 
Intensive Care database which contains vital signs, laboratory data, and journal 
entries from approximately 59,000 ICU patients. We show that LiSep LSTM can 
outperform a less complex model, using the same features and targets, with an 
AUROC 0.8306 (95% confidence interval: 0.8236, 0.8376) and median offsets 
between prediction and septic shock onset up to 40 hours (interquartile range, 
20 to 135 hours). Moreover, we discuss how our classifier performs at specific 
offsets before septic shock onset, and compare it with five state-of-the-art 
machine learning algorithms for early detection of sepsis.

BACKGROUND: Sepsis is a life-threatening condition that requires rapid 
assessment to reduce mortality. This study investigates the relationship between 
the Neutrophil-to-Monocyte/Lymphocyte Ratio (NMLR) upon ICU admission and 28-day 
mortality in sepsis patients.
METHODS: A retrospective analysis was performed using clinical data from sepsis 
patients in the Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care IV (MIMIC-IV). 
Multivariate logistic regression, sensitivity analyses, and Restricted Cubic 
Spline (RCS) models were employed to explore the relationship between ICU 
admission NMLR and 28-day mortality. Kaplan-Meier method and inverse probability 
weighting (IPW) were used to adjust for confounders and estimate survival 
outcomes. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve evaluating the 
predictive value of NLMR for 28-day mortality in ICU sepsis patients. Subgroup 
analyses considered factors like age, sex, race, comorbidities, and disease 
severity.
RESULTS: In total, 8,710 patients were included. Increased NMLR was associated 
with higher 28-day all-cause mortality, confirmed by multiple logistic 
regression models. In Model 3, after adjusting for confounders, each standard 
deviation increase in NMLR was associated with a 1.5% increase in 28-day 
mortality risk. Kaplan-Meier and IPW survival analyses showed higher 28-day 
all-cause mortality in patients with elevated NMLR levels at ICU admission 
compared to those with lower levels (p < 0.0001, p = 0.031). RCS models 
suggested a potential non-linear relationship between NMLR and 28-day mortality. 
ROC curve for the NMLR model, with an AUC of 0.658 (95% CI: 0.642-0.673). 
Sensitivity analyses confirmed the association even after excluding patients 
with myocardial infarction and severe liver disease.
CONCLUSION: Elevated NMLR at ICU admission is significantly associated with 
increased 28-day all-cause mortality in sepsis patients, suggesting its 
potential as an early prognostic indicator for risk assessment and intervention.

Forecasting Treatment Outcomes Over Time Using Alternating Deep Sequential 
Models.

Wu F, Zhao G, Zhou Y, Qian X, Elias BK, H Lehman LW.

Medical decision making often relies on accurately forecasting future patient 
trajectories. Conventional approaches for patient progression modeling often do 
not explicitly model treatments when predicting patient trajectories and 
outcomes. In this paper, we propose Alternating Transformer (AL-Transformer) to 
jointly model treatment and clinical outcomes over time as alternating 
sequential models. We leverage causal convolution in the self-attention 
mechanism of AL-Transformer to incorporate local spatial information in the 
sequence, thus enhancing the model's ability to capture local contextual 
information of the sequence. Additionally, to predict the sparse treatment, a 
constraint learned by a convolutional neural network (CNN) is used to constrain 
the sparse treatment output. Experimental results on two datasets from patients 
with sepsis and respiratory failure extracted from the Medical Information Mart 
for Intensive Care (MIMIC) database demonstrate the effectiveness of the 
proposed approach, outperforming existing state-of-the-art methods.

BACKGROUND: The prevalence of persistent inflammation, immunosuppression, and 
catabolism syndrome (PICS) has an upward trend in sepsis patients and can be 
associated with poor outcomes. Thyroid hormones are expected to be correlated 
with inflammation, immunity, and metabolism. Thus, the purpose of this study was 
to evaluate the effect of thyroid hormones on the occurrence of PICS and then 
further explore the optimal level of them in sepsis.
METHODS: This retrospective observational study used the online database Medical 
Information Mart for Intensive Care (MIMIC)-IV. Univariate and multivariate 
logistic regression analyses were employed to determine correlations between 
thyroid hormone levels and PICS. A combination of independent PICS development 
factors was established with accuracy assessed using the area under the receiver 
operating characteristic curve (AUC-ROC).
RESULTS: Patients were divided into PICS (n=205) and non-PICS (n=671) groups. 
The third quartiles of triiodothyronine (T3) (60-80ng/dl) and thyroxine (T4) 
(5.5-6.8ug/dl) had the lowest PICS incidence and the adjusted odds ratio (OR) 
was 0.33 (T3, p=0.009) and 0.39 (T4, p=0.006), respectively, compared with the 
first quartiles of T3 and T4. For patients with a pre-existing T3 deficiency, 
severe deficiency (T3 <60ng/dl) and a high Sequential Organ Failure Assessment 
(SOFA) score were significantly related to PICS incidence. The AUC for these 
combined parameters in predicting PICS occurrence was 0.748 (all patients) and 
0.861 (patients without thyroid disease).
CONCLUSIONS: A mild T3 deficiency (60-80ng/dl) was significantly associated with 
the lowest risk-adjusted PICS occurrence in patients with sepsis. A severe T3 
deficiency (<60ng/dl) and a high SOFA score were independent risk factors for 
PICS occurrence.

BACKGROUND: The effect of ramelteon, a melatonin receptor agonist, on survival 
in septic patients remains unknown. The purpose of this retrospective cohort 
study was to explore the relationship between ramelteon exposure and survival 
outcomes in septic patients.
METHODS: Data from septic patients admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) 
were extracted from the Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care IV 
(MIMIC-IV) database, with patients categorized into ramelteon exposure and 
non-exposure groups based on the use of ramelteon. The primary outcome was 
30-day mortality, and secondary outcomes included 90-day mortality, in-hospital 
mortality, length of ICU stay, and hospital stay. Propensity score matching 
(PSM) and inverse probability of treatment weighting (IPTW) were employed to 
address confounding variables. Kaplan-Meier (K-M) analysis and Cox proportional 
hazards regression models for stepwise regression were utilized to assess the 
impact of ramelteon exposure on survival.
RESULTS: This study included 22,152 unexposed patients and 2,708 exposed 
patients, resulting in 2,607 matched pairs after PSM. Following PSM, ramelteon 
exposure was associated with significantly lower in-hospital mortality (11.6% 
vs.19.7%, p < 0.001), 30-day mortality (13.4% vs. 23.2%, p < 0.001), and 90-day 
mortality (22.1% vs. 30%, p < 0.001).K-M curves demonstrated a significant 
difference in 30-day and 90-day mortality between the two groups (P < 0.001), 
irrespective of PSM application. Both PSM (hazard ratio [HR] = 0.53, 95% 
confidence intervals [CIs] 0.47-0.61, p < 0.001) and IPTW models (HR = 0.59, 95% 
CI 0.50-0.70, p < 0.001) indicated a significant positive effect of ramelteon 
usage on 30-day mortality among septic patients compared to the non-exposure 
group.
CONCLUSIONS: This exploratory, retrospective study suggests an association 
between ramelteon exposure and reduced 30-day and 90-day mortality in septic 
patients compared with the non-exposure group. Considering the limitations of 
the retrospective design and the potential for unmeasured confounding, 
well-designed prospective studies and randomized controlled trials will be 
needed to confirm these findings.

BACKGROUND: To compare the effects of proton pump inhibitor (PPI) and 
histamine-2 receptor antagonist (H2RA) use on the occurrence of acute kidney 
injury (AKI) in septic patients at high risk for developing stress ulcers.
METHODS: Using the Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care IV version 2.2 
database, septic patients with high-risk factors for stress ulcers (i.e., shock, 
coagulopathy, invasive mechanical ventilation, or chronic liver diseases) were 
included. Exposures included PPIs and H2RAs within 24 h of intensive care unit 
(ICU) admission or prior to ICU admission. The primary end point was severe 
sepsis-associated AKI as defined by the Kidney Disease Improving Global Outcomes 
criteria stage 3 (KDIGO-3). Propensity score matching (PSM) was performed to 
balance baseline characteristics. Multivariable Cox proportional hazards 
regression was used to estimate the effect size.
RESULTS: 4731 PPI users and 4903 H2RA users were included. After PSM, there were 
1785 pairs exposed to PPIs and H2RAs. In the PSM cohort, the cumulative incident 
KDIGO-3 rate was higher in the PPI group than in the H2RA group (log-rank test, 
p = 0.009). Regression analyses showed that PPI exposure [adjusted hazard ratio 
1.32, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.11-1.58, p = 0.002] was associated with 
incident KDIGO-3 compared with H2RA use. This association remained consistent in 
sensitivity analyses. Additionally, the PPI group had a higher need for kidney 
replacement therapy compared with the H2RA group (3.6% vs. 2.1%, P = 0.012).
CONCLUSIONS: Among septic patients at high risk for developing stress ulcers, 
PPI exposure was associated with incident KDIGO-3 AKI compared with H2RA use.

BACKGROUND: Acute kidney injury (AKI) is an important complication in critically 
ill patients, especially in sepsis and septic shock patients. Early prediction 
of AKI in septic shock can provide clinicians with sufficient information for 
timely intervention so that improve the patients' survival rate and quality of 
life. The aim of this study was to establish a nomogram that predicts the risk 
of AKI in patients with septic shock in the intensive care unit (ICU).
METHODS: The data were collected from the Medical Information Mart for Intensive 
Care III (MIMIC-III) database between 2001 and 2012. The primary outcome was AKI 
in the 48 h following ICU admission. Univariate and multivariate logistic 
regression analyses were used to screen the independent risk factors of AKI. The 
performance of the nomogram was evaluated according to the calibration curve, 
receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve, decision curve analysis, and 
clinical impact curve.
RESULTS: A total of 2415 patients with septic shock were included in this study. 
In the training and validation cohort, 1091 (64.48%) of 1690 patients and 475 
(65.52%) of 725 patients developed AKI, respectively. The predictive factors for 
nomogram construction were gender, ethnicity, congestive heart failure, 
diabetes, obesity, Simplified Acute Physiology Score II (SAPS II), 
angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEI) or angiotensin receptor blockers 
(ARBs), bilirubin, creatinine, blood urea nitrogen (BUN), and mechanical 
ventilation. The model had a good discrimination with the area under the ROC 
curve of 0.756 and 0.760 in the training and validation cohorts, respectively. 
The calibration curve for probability of AKI in septic shock showed optimal 
agreement between prediction by nomogram and actual observation. Decision curve 
and clinical impact curve analysis indicated that the nomogram conferred high 
clinical net benefit.
CONCLUSION: The proposed nomogram can quickly and effectively predict the risk 
of AKI at an early stage in patients with septic shock in ICU, which can provide 
information for timely and efficient intervention in patients with septic shock 
in the ICU setting.

OBJECTIVES: Echocardiography is commonly used for hemodynamic assessment in 
sepsis, but data regarding its association with outcome are conflicting. The aim 
of this study was to evaluate the association between echocardiography and 
outcomes in patients with septic shock using the Medical Information Mart for 
Intensive Care IV database.
DESIGN: Retrospective cohort study comparing patients who did or did not undergo 
transthoracic echocardiography within the first 5 days of admission for the 
primary outcome of 28-day mortality.
SETTING: Admissions to the Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center intensive care 
from 2008 to 2019.
PATIENTS: Adults 16 years old or older with septic shock requiring vasopressor 
support within 48 hours of admission. Readmissions and patients admitted to the 
coronary care unit or cardiovascular intensive care were excluded, as well as 
patients with ST-elevation myocardial infarction or cardiac arrest.
INTERVENTIONS: None.
MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Echocardiography was performed in 1,515 (27%) of 
5,697 eligible admissions. The primary outcome was analyzed using a marginal 
structural model and rolling entry matching to adjust for baseline and 
time-varying confounders. Patients who underwent echocardiography showed no 
significant difference in 28-day mortality (adjusted hazard ratio 1.09; 95% CI, 
0.95-1.25; p = 0.24). This was consistent across multiple sensitivity analyses. 
Secondary outcomes were changes in management instituted within 4 hours of 
imaging. Treatment changes occurred in 493 patients (33%) compared with 431 
matched controls (29%), with the most common intervention being the 
administration of a fluid bolus.
CONCLUSIONS: Echocardiography in sepsis was not associated with a reduction in 
28-day mortality based on observational data. These findings do not negate the 
utility of echo in cases of diagnostic uncertainty or inadequate response to 
initial treatment.

BACKGROUND: It is unclear whether the magnitude and duration of elevated central 
venous pressure (ECVP) greater than ten mmHg has the same impact on mortality in 
sepsis patients.
METHODS: Critically ill patients with sepsis were identified from the Medical 
Information Mart for Intensive Care (MIMIC)-IV database. The duration and the 
magnitude of ECVP were calculated. Normalized ECVP load was defined as the ECVP 
load (the sum of ECVP value times its duration) divided by the total duration of 
ECVP. The primary endpoint was 28-day mortality. Kaplan-Meier survival analysis 
was used to compare survival between patients with high or low normalized ECVP 
load.
RESULTS: A total of 1071 sepsis patients were included. Higher normalized ECVP 
load was associated with higher mortality rate; in contrast, the duration of 
ECVP was not associated with mortality. A linear relationship between normalized 
ECVP load and mortality was identified. Patients with higher normalized ECVP 
load had less urine output and more positive fluid balance.
CONCLUSION: The magnitude, but not the duration of ECVP, is associated with 
mortality in sepsis patients. ECVP should be considered as a valuable and easily 
accessible safety parameter during fluid resuscitation.

BACKGROUND: Sepsis-associated liver injury (SALI) is a common complication in 
sepsis patients, significantly affecting their prognosis. Previous studies have 
shown that aspirin can improve the prognosis of septic patients. However, there 
is currently a lack of clinical evidence supporting the use of aspirin in the 
treatment of SALI. Therefore, we conducted this study to explore the association 
between the use of aspirin and the prognosis of patients with SALI.
METHODS: The patients in this study were obtained from the Medical Information 
Mart for Intensive Care IV (MIMIC-IV) database, version 3.0. The primary outcome 
was 30-day all-cause mortality. Baseline characteristics between the aspirin and 
non-aspirin groups were balanced using propensity score matching (PSM). The 
Kaplan-Meier survival curve and Cox regression analysis were used to investigate 
the association between aspirin use and the prognosis of patients with SALI.
RESULTS: Of 657 SALI patients in this study, 447 (68%) patients had not used 
aspirin during hospitalization, whereas 210 (32%) had. After PSM, the 30-day 
mortality was 33.1% in the non-aspirin group and 21% in the aspirin group, 
indicating a significantly reduced mortality risk in the aspirin group (HR, 
0.57; 95% CI, 0.37-0.90; P = 0.016). Similarly, the results of the multivariable 
Cox regression analysis and inverse probability weighting (IPW) analysis showed 
that, compared to the non-aspirin group, the aspirin group had a significantly 
lower 30-day mortality risk (Multivariable Cox regression analysis: HR, 0.69; 
95% CI, 0.48-0.99; P = 0.047; IPW: HR, 0.62; 95% CI, 0.43-0.89; P = 0.010).
CONCLUSION: Aspirin can reduce 30-day mortality in SALI patients, regardless of 
the dose or timing of administration. However, careful assessment based on 
individual differences is essential to ensure the safety and effectiveness of 
aspirin use.

Sepsis is a life-threatening condition with a high mortality rate. Early 
prediction and treatment are the most effective strategies for increasing 
survival rates. This paper proposes a neural architecture search (NAS) model to 
predict the onset of sepsis with a low computational cost and high search 
performance by applying a genetic algorithm (GA). The proposed model shares the 
weights of all possible connection nodes internally within the neural network. 
Externally, the search cost is reduced through the weight-sharing effect between 
the genotypes of the GA. A predictive analysis was performed using the Medical 
Information Mart for Intensive Care III (MIMIC-III), a medical time-series 
dataset, with the primary objective of predicting sepsis onset 3 h before 
occurrence. In addition, experiments were conducted under various prediction 
times (0-12 h) for comparison. The proposed model exhibited an area under the 
receiver operating characteristic curve (AUROC) score of 0.94 (95% CI: 
0.92-0.96) for 3 h, which is 0.31-0.26 higher than the scores obtained using the 
Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (SOFA), quick SOFA (qSOFA), and Simplified 
Acute Physiology Score (SAPS) II scoring systems. Furthermore, the proposed 
model exhibited a 12% improvement in the AUROC value over a simple model based 
on the long short-term memory neural network. Additionally, it is not only 
optimally searchable for sepsis onset prediction, but also outperforms 
conventional models that use similar predictive purposes and datasets. Notably, 
it is sufficiently robust to shape changes in the input data and has less 
structural dependence.

Background: the optimal timing of Transthoracic echocardiography (TTE) 
performance for patients with septic shock remains unexplored. Methods: a 
retrospective cohort study included patients with septic shock in the MIMIC-Ⅲ 
database. Risk-adjusted restricted cubic splines modeled the 28-day mortality 
according to time elapsed from ICU admission to receive TTE. The cut point when 
a smooth curve inflected was selected to define early and delayed group. We 
applied propensity score matching (PSM) to ensure our findings were reliable. 
Causal mediation analysis was used to assess the intermediate effect of fluid 
balance within 72 h after ICU admission. Results: 3264 participants were 
enrolled and the risk of 28-day mortality increased until the wait time was 
around 10 h (Early group) and then was relatively flat afterwards (Delayed 
group). A beneficial effect of early TTE in terms of the 28-day mortality was 
observed (HRs 0.73−0.78, all p < 0.05) in the PSM. The indirect effect brought 
by the fluid balance on day 2 and 3 was significant (both p = 0.006). 
Conclusion: early TTE performance might be associated with lower risk-adjusted 
28-day mortality in patients with septic shock. Better fluid balance may have 
mediated this effect. A wait time within 10 h after ICU may represent a 
threshold defining progressively increasing risk.

PURPOSE: Although corticosteroids are recommended in the 2021 Surviving Sepsis 
Campaign (SSC) guidelines, evidence with respect to their effects on short-term 
mortality remains conflicting. We conducted this study to identify whether 
corticosteroids alter 28-day mortality in septic shock patients with 
gram-negative bacterial infection.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: A total of 621 patients with septic shock and 
gram-negative bacterial culture results were identified from the Medical 
Information Mart for Intensive Care IV (MIMIC-IV) database. Propensity score 
matching (PSM) was performed, and Kaplan-Meier survival curve analyses with 
log-rank tests were used to determine the relationship between corticosteroid 
use and the risk of 28-day mortality. Subgroup analyses were conducted to assess 
whether the conclusions were stable and reliable.
RESULTS: Corticosteroid administration was associated with increased 28-day 
mortality in septic shock patients with gram-negative bacterial infection 
(log-rank test P = 0.028). The incidence of Stage 2 or 3 AKI and the rate of 
hospital mortality were higher among patients who received corticosteroids. The 
incidence of Stage 2 or 3 AKI in the early period significantly mediated the 
relationship between corticosteroid use and 28-day mortality [P =0.046 for the 
average causal mediation effect (ACME)]. Interaction tests indicated that the 
effect of corticosteroid use was maintained in patients with a 
neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio (NLR) of <20 (P-value for interaction = 0.027).
CONCLUSION: Systemic corticosteroid use could be harmful in septic shock 
patients with gram-negative bacterial infection, especially in patients with 
relatively low NLR.

Pulmonary embolism (PE) is a common and potentially lethal form of venous 
thromboembolic disease in ICU patients. A limited number of risk factors have 
been associated with PE in ICU patients. In this study, we aimed to screen the 
independent risk factors of PE in ICU patients that can be used to evaluate the 
patient's condition and provide targeted treatment. We performed a retrospective 
cohort study using a freely accessible critical care database Medical 
Information Mart for Intensive Care (MIMIC)-III. The ICU patients were divided 
into two groups based on the incidence of PE. Finally, 9871 ICU patients were 
included, among which 204 patients (2.1%) had pulmonary embolism. During the 
multivariate logistic regression analysis, sepsis, hospital_LOS (the length of 
stay in hospital), type of admission, tumor, APTT (activated partial 
thromboplastin time) and platelet were independent risk factors for patients for 
PE in ICU, with OR values of 1.471 (95%CI 1.001-2.162), 1.001 (95%CI 
1.001-1.001), 3.745 (95%CI 2.187-6.414), 1.709 (95%CI 1.247-2.341), 1.014 (95%CI 
1.010-1.017) and 1.002 (95%CI 1.001-1.003) (Ps < 0.05). ROC curve analysis 
showed that the composite indicator had a higher predictive value for ICU 
patients with PE, with a ROC area under the curve (AUC) of 0.743 (95%CI 0.710 
-0.776, p < 0.001). Finally, sepsis, tumor, platelet count, length of stay in 
the hospital, emergency admission and APTT were independent predictors of PE in 
ICU patients.

BACKGROUND: The Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (SOFA) score monitors organ 
failure and defines sepsis but may not fully capture factors influencing sepsis 
mortality. Socioeconomic and demographic impacts on sepsis outcomes have been 
highlighted recently.
OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the prognostic value of SOFA scores against demographic 
and social health determinants for predicting sepsis mortality in critically ill 
patients, and to assess if a combined model increases predictive accuracy.
METHODS: The study utilized retrospective data from the MIMIC-IV database and 
prospective external validation from the Penn State Health cohort. A Random 
Forest model incorporating SOFA scores, demographic/social data, and the 
Charlson Comorbidity Index was trained and validated.
FINDINGS: In the MIMIC-IV dataset of 32,970 sepsis patients, 6,824 (20.7%) died 
within 30 days. A model including demographic, socioeconomic, and comorbidity 
data with SOFA scores improved predictive accuracy beyond SOFA scores alone. Day 
2 SOFA, age, weight, and comorbidities were significant predictors. External 
validation showed consistent performance, highlighting the importance of delta 
SOFA between days 1 and 3.
CONCLUSION: Adding patient-specific demographic and socioeconomic information to 
clinical metrics significantly improves sepsis mortality prediction. This 
suggests a more comprehensive, multidimensional prognostic approach is needed 
for accurate sepsis outcome predictions.

BACKGROUND: Sepsis is often accompanied by organ dysfunction and acute organ 
failure, among which the liver is commonly involved. Sepsis patients suffering 
from liver injury have a greater risk of mortality than patients suffering from 
general sepsis. As of now, there are no tools that are specifically designed for 
assessing the prognosis of such patients. This study aimed to develop and 
validate a model to predict the risk of in-hospital mortality in patients with 
sepsis-associated liver injury (SALI).
METHODS: Data were obtained from the Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care 
(MIMIC)-IV database. In the analysis, all patients with SALI who met the 
inclusion and exclusion criteria were included. A primary outcome was 
in-hospital mortality, and clinical data were extracted for these patients. In a 
ratio of 8:2, the data were divided into training and validation groups at 
random. Least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) regression was 
used for data dimension reduction and feature selection, and independent factors 
related to prognosis were identified through multi-factor logistics analysis. A 
nomogram was developed to visualize the model, and the performance of the model 
was evaluated by the area under the curve (AUC) as well as calibration and 
decision curve analysis (DCA) through internal verification.
RESULTS: A total of 616 and 154 patients with SALI were included in the training 
and validation cohorts, respectively. The LASSO regression and logistic 
multivariate analysis showed that nine factors were associated with in-hospital 
mortality in patients with SALI. Both the training and validation cohorts had 
higher AUCs than sequential organ failure assessment (SOFA) and simplified acute 
physiology score 2 (SAPS2): 0.753 (95% CI: 0.715-0.791) and 0.783 (95% CI: 
0.749-0.817), respectively. Both the training and validation cohorts showed good 
calibration results for the prediction model. In terms of clinical 
practicability, DCA of the predictive model demonstrated greater net benefits 
than the SOFA and SAPS2 scores.
CONCLUSIONS: We developed a predictive model that can effectively predict the 
in-hospital mortality of SALI patients, with satisfactory performance and 
clinical practicability. This model can assist clinicians in the early 
identification of high-risk patients and provide a reference for clinical 
treatment strategies.

BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: Interpretable and real-time prediction of sepsis and 
risk factor analysis could enable timely treatment by clinicians and improve 
patient outcomes. To develop an interpretable machine-learning model for the 
prediction and risk factor analysis of sepsis and septic death.
METHODS: This is a retrospective observational cohort study based on the Medical 
Information Mart for Intensive Care (MIMIC-IV) dataset; 69,619 patients from the 
database were screened. The two outcomes include patients diagnosed with sepsis 
and the death of septic patients. Clinical variables from ICU admission to 
outcomes were analyzed: demographic data, vital signs, Glasgow Coma Scale 
scores, laboratory test results, and results for arterial blood gasses (ABGs). 
Model performance was compared using the area under the receiver operating 
characteristic curve (AUROC). Model interpretations were based on the Shapley 
additive explanations (SHAP), and the clustered analysis was based on the 
combination of K-means and dimensionality reduction algorithms of t-SNE and PCA.
RESULTS: For the analysis of sepsis and septic death, 47,185 and 2480 patients 
were enrolled, respectively. The XGBoost model achieved a predictive value of 
area under the curve (AUC): 0.745 [0.731-0.759] for sepsis prediction and 0.8 
[0.77, 0.828] for septic death prediction. The real-time prediction model was 
trained to predict by day and visualize the individual or combined risk factor 
effects on the outcomes based on SHAP values. Clustered analysis separated the 
two phenotypes with distinct risk factors among patients with septic death.
CONCLUSION: The proposed real-time, clustered prediction model for sepsis and 
septic death exhibited superior performance in predicting the outcomes and 
visualizing the risk factors in a real-time and interpretable manner to 
distinguish and mitigate patient risks, thus promising immense potential in 
effective clinical decision making and comprehensive understanding of complex 
diseases such as sepsis.

This study aimed to explore the association between admission hemoglobin level 
and clinical outcomes in sepsis based on Medical Information Mart for Intensive 
Care IV(MIMIC-IV) database. It was a retrospective study. Sepsis patients in the 
database were included. Data extraction from MIMIC-IV was performed by 
PostgreSQL 9.6 software. Three different models including crude model (adjusted 
for none), model I (adjusted for gender and age) and model II (adjusted for all 
potential cofounders) were constructed. A generalized liner model and a smooth 
fitting curve for indicating the relationship between hemoglobin level and 
30-day mortality were performed. 6249 septic patients with a 30.18% of 30-day 
mortality were included. With 1 g/dl increment in hemoglobin level, the values 
of odds ratio (OR) in crude model, model I and model II were 0.96 (95% 
confidential interval (CI) 0.94-0.99, P = 0.0023), 0.96 (95%CI 0.93-0.98, 
P = 0.0010) and 0.87 (95%CI 0.79-0.95, P = 0.0020), respectively. The smooth 
fitting curve indicated a non-linear relationship and the turning point was 
7.2 g/dl. Compared the hemoglobin group < 7.2 g/dl, the risk of 30-day mortality 
significantly decreased by 32% in the hemoglobin group ≥ 7.2 g/dl (OR = 0.68, 
95%CI 0.51-0.93, P = 0.0142). The non-linear relationship between admission 
hemoglobin level and 30-day mortality in sepsis was found. Hemoglobin 
supplementation might be beneficial for septic patients with hemoglobin 
level < 7.2 g/dl.

Pan-Immune-Inflammation Value (PIV) has recently received more attention as a 
novel indicator of inflammation. We aimed to evaluate the association between 
PIV and prognosis in septic patients. Data were extracted from the Medical 
Information Mart for Intensive Care IV database. The primary and secondary 
outcomes were 28-day and 90-day mortality. The association between PIV and 
outcomes was assessed by Kaplan-Meier curves, Cox regression analysis, 
restricted cubic spline curves and subgroup analysis. A total of 11,331 septic 
patients were included. Kaplan-Meier curves showed that septic patients with 
higher PIV had lower 28-day survival rate. In multivariable Cox regression 
analysis, log2-PIV was positively associated with the risk of 28-day mortality 
[HR (95% CI) 1.06 (1.03, 1.09), P < 0.001]. The relationship between log2-PIV 
and 28-day mortality was non-linear with a predicted inflection point at 8. To 
the right of the inflection point, high log2-PIV was associated with an 
increased 28-day mortality risk [HR (95% CI) 1.13 (1.09, 1.18), P < 0.001]. 
However, to the left of this point, this association was non-significant [HR 
(95% CI) 1.01 (0.94, 1.08), P = 0.791]. Similar results were found for 90-day 
mortality. Our study showed a non-linear relationship between PIV and 28-day and 
90-day mortality risk in septic patients.

OBJECTIVES: Patients with sepsis are often comorbid with acute respiratory 
distress syndrome (ARDS), and the phenotypic characteristics of pulmonary and 
non-pulmonary infections leading to ARDS are still unclear. This study aimed to 
compare the phenotypic characteristics of ARDS resulting from pulmonary 
infections and other non-site infections and provide better guidance for 
clinical treatment.
METHODS: We conducted a multicenter cohort analysis using data from the Tianjin 
Medical University General Hospital, Medical Information Mart for Intensive 
Care-IV (MIMIC-IV), and the electronic intensive care unit (eICU) databases. The 
study population consisted of adult patients diagnosed with sepsis and ARDS. The 
primary objectives were to compare the characteristics and outcomes of patients 
with pulmonary infection-induced ARDS and those with non-pulmonary 
infection-induced ARDS using Wilcoxon analysis, Kaplan-Meier curves, correlation 
analysis, propensity matching scores, and other statistical methods.
RESULTS: Patients with ARDS by pulmonary infection may be more likely to have a 
history of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, and abdominal infection was 
more likely to induce ARDS in sepsis patients with non-pulmonary infection. 
Pulmonary infections caused by Klebsiella pneumoniae and Acinetobacter baumannii 
were more likely to induce ARDS. The oxygenation index and prognosis of ARDS 
patients induced by pulmonary infection were worse than those caused by other 
infections, with lower PaO2, PaO2/FiO2, and ROX index and longer hospital stay. 
More ARDS patients with pulmonary infection were given mechanical ventilation 
therapy, with higher mortality, APACHE II, SOFA, and SAPS II. The further 
correlation analysis showed that the prognostic scores of ARDS patients were 
negatively correlated with PaO2/FiO2 and ROX index. The above results were 
confirmed to varying degrees by propensity matching scores, external cohort 
validation, and other methods.
CONCLUSION: Pulmonary infection induces a worse prognosis of ARDS than other 
site infections in patients with sepsis and ARDS. These patients require 
heightened vigilance, early intervention, and possibly more aggressive 
management strategies.

Sepsis is an organ failure disease caused by an infection acquired in an 
intensive care unit (ICU), which leads to a high mortality rate. Developing 
intelligent monitoring and early warning systems for sepsis is a key research 
area in the field of smart healthcare. Early and accurate identification of 
patients at high risk of sepsis can help doctors make the best clinical 
decisions and reduce the mortality rate of patients with sepsis. However, the 
scientific understanding of sepsis remains inadequate, leading to slow progress 
in sepsis research. With the accumulation of electronic medical records (EMRs) 
in hospitals, data mining technologies that can identify patient risk patterns 
from the vast amount of sepsis-related EMRs and the development of smart 
surveillance and early warning models show promise in reducing mortality. Based 
on the Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care Ⅲ, a massive dataset of ICU 
EMRs published by MIT and Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center, we propose a 
Temporal Convolution Attention Model for Sepsis Clinical Assistant Diagnosis 
Prediction (TCASP) to predict the incidence of sepsis infection in ICU patients. 
First, sepsis patient data is extracted from the EMRs. Then, the incidence of 
sepsis is predicted based on various physiological features of sepsis patients 
in the ICU. Finally, the TCASP model is utilized to predict the time of the 
first sepsis infection in ICU patients. The experiments show that the proposed 
model achieves an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUROC) 
score of 86.9% (an improvement of 6.4% ) and an area under the precision-recall 
curve (AUPRC) score of 63.9% (an improvement of 3.9% ) compared to five 
state-of-the-art models.

BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Thrombocytopenia is common among sepsis patients. 
Platelet transfusions are frequently administered to increase platelet counts, 
but their clinical impacts remain unclear in sepsis-induced thrombocytopenia. 
The goal of this study was to explore the association between platelet 
transfusion and mortality in patients with sepsis-induced thrombocytopenia.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: The study was based on the Medical Information Mart for 
Intensive Care (MIMIC) III database. Septic patients with severe 
thrombocytopenia (a platelet count ≤ 50/nl) were included in the study and were 
divided into two groups: a platelet transfusion group (PT group) and a no 
platelet transfusion group (NPT group). The primary outcome was in-hospital 
mortality, and the secondary outcomes were the length of intensive care unit 
(ICU) stay (LOS-ICU) and 90-day mortality. Propensity score matching 
multivariable logistic regression was used to reduce the imbalance.
RESULTS: A total of 1733 patients were included: 296 patients were included in 
the PT group and 1437 patients were included in the NPT group. After propensity 
score matching, 296 paired patients constituted each group. Crude hospital 
mortality was significantly higher in the PT group than in the NPT group (145 
[48.99%] vs. 567 [39.46%], p = 0.002). In the extended multivariable logistic 
models for hospital mortality, the odds ratio (OR) of receiving a platelet 
transfusion was consistently significant in all six models (OR range, 
1.340-1.525, p < 0.05 for all). In the following subgroups, platelet transfusion 
was associated with increased in-hospital mortality: age > 60 years; sex: 
female; sequential organ failure assessment score ≤8; simplified acute 
physiology score ≤ 47; platelet count >29/nl and the complication of congestive 
heart failure. However, there were no significant differences in the 90-day 
mortality rate (170 [57.43%] vs. 741 [51.57%], p = 0.066) or the LOS-ICU (5.84 
[2.68-11.78] vs. 4.94 [2.18-12.72], p = 0.442) between the two groups. All these 
results remained stable after adjustment for confounders and in the comparisons 
after propensity score matching.
CONCLUSIONS: The propensity score-matched analysis showed that platelet 
transfusion was associated with increased in-hospital mortality in septic 
patients with severe thrombocytopenia (a platelet count ≤ 50/nl). However, it 
was not associated with 90-day mortality or the length of ICU stay.

BACKGROUND: Sepsis-associated acute kidney injury (S-AKI) is considered to be 
associated with high morbidity and mortality, a commonly accepted model to 
predict mortality is urged consequently. This study used a machine learning 
model to identify vital variables associated with mortality in S-AKI patients in 
the hospital and predict the risk of death in the hospital. We hope that this 
model can help identify high-risk patients early and reasonably allocate medical 
resources in the intensive care unit (ICU).
METHODS: A total of 16,154 S-AKI patients from the Medical Information Mart for 
Intensive Care IV database were examined as the training set (80%) and the 
validation set (20%). Variables (129 in total) were collected, including basic 
patient information, diagnosis, clinical data, and medication records. We 
developed and validated machine learning models using 11 different algorithms 
and selected the one that performed the best. Afterward, recursive feature 
elimination was used to select key variables. Different indicators were used to 
compare the prediction performance of each model. The SHapley Additive 
exPlanations package was applied to interpret the best machine learning model in 
a web tool for clinicians to use. Finally, we collected clinical data of S-AKI 
patients from two hospitals for external validation.
RESULTS: In this study, 15 critical variables were finally selected, namely, 
urine output, maximum blood urea nitrogen, rate of injection of norepinephrine, 
maximum anion gap, maximum creatinine, maximum red blood cell volume 
distribution width, minimum international normalized ratio, maximum heart rate, 
maximum temperature, maximum respiratory rate, minimum fraction of inspired O2, 
minimum creatinine, minimum Glasgow Coma Scale, and diagnosis of diabetes and 
stroke. The categorical boosting algorithm model presented significantly better 
predictive performance [receiver operating characteristic (ROC): 0.83] than 
other models [accuracy (ACC): 75%, Youden index: 50%, sensitivity: 75%, 
specificity: 75%, F1 score: 0.56, positive predictive value (PPV): 44%, and 
negative predictive value (NPV): 92%]. External validation data from two 
hospitals in China were also well validated (ROC: 0.75).
CONCLUSIONS: After selecting 15 crucial variables, a machine learning-based 
model for predicting the mortality of S-AKI patients was successfully 
established and the CatBoost model demonstrated best predictive performance.

Background and Objectives: Urinary tract infection (UTI) is a common comorbidity 
in diabetic patients, making up one of the causes of sepsis. This study aims to 
develop a nomogram to predict the risk probability of sepsis in diabetic 
patients with UTI (DPUTIs). Materials and Methods: This is a retrospective 
observational study. Clinical data for DPUTIs were extracted from the Medical 
Information Mart for Intensive Care IV database. Eligible DPUTIs were randomly 
divided into training and validation cohorts in a 7:3 ratio. Independent 
prognostic factors for sepsis risk were determined using least absolute 
shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) regression and multivariate logistic 
regression. A corresponding nomogram based on these factors was constructed to 
predict sepsis occurrence in DPUTIs. The discrimination of the nomogram was 
assessed by multiple indicators, including the area under the receiver operating 
characteristic curve (AUC), net reclassification improvement index (NRI), and 
integrated discrimination improvement (IDI). In addition, a calibration curve 
and decision curve analysis (DCA) were used to evaluate the performance of the 
nomogram. Results: A total of 1990 DPUTIs were included. Nine independent 
prognostic factors were identified as predictive factors for sepsis risk in 
DPUTIs. The prognostic factors included urine red blood cell classification 
(urine RBC cat), urine white blood cell classification (urine WBC cat), blood 
glucose, age, temperature, white blood cells (WBCs), sequential organ failure 
assessment (SOFA) score, lymphocytes, and hematocrit. The AUC, NRI, and IDI of 
the nomogram indicated robust discrimination. The calibration curve and 
Hosmer-Lemeshow test showed good calibration of the nomogram. The DCA curve 
demonstrated a better clinical utility of the nomogram. Conclusions: The 
nomogram established in this study helps clinicians predict the probability of 
sepsis in DPUTIs, providing evidence for optimizing the management of related 
risk factors.

OBJECTIVE: Dexmedetomidine has demonstrated potential in preclinical medical 
research as a protective agent against inflammatory injuries and a provider of 
neuroprotective benefits. However, its effect on the short-term prognosis of 
patients with sepsis-associated encephalopathy remains unclear. This study aims 
to explore the underlying value of dexmedetomidine in these patients.
PATIENTS AND METHODS: This study enrolled patients with sepsis-associated 
encephalopathy from the Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care (MIMIC)-IV 
database, and they were divided into two groups based on dexmedetomidine therapy 
during hospitalization. Propensity score matching (PSM) and inverse probability 
of treatment weighting (IPTW) were utilized to balance the inter-group baseline 
differences. Kaplan-Meier (KM) curves with log-rank test and subgroup analysis 
were also employed. The primary outcome was 28-day mortality, and the secondary 
outcomes were in-hospital mortality, intensive care unit (ICU) stay time, 
hospital stay time, and the incidence of ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP).
RESULTS: After PSM, 1,075 pairs of patients were matched. In contrast to the 
non-dexmedetomidine cohort, the dexmedetomidine cohort did not exhibit a 
shortened ICU [4.65 (3.16, 8.55) vs. 6.14 (3.66, 11.04), p<0.001] and hospital 
stay duration [10.04 (6.55, 15.93) vs. 12.76 (7.92, 19.95), p<0.001], and there 
was an elevated incidence of VAP [90 (8.4%) vs. 135 (12.6%), p=0.002]. The 
log-rank test for the KM curves of dexmedetomidine use and 28-day mortality was 
statistically significant (p<0.001). The results showed that dexmedetomidine was 
associated with improved 28-day mortality [hazard ratio (HR) 0.46, 95% 
confidence interval (CI) 0.35-0.61, p<0.001] and in-hospital mortality (HR 0.50, 
95% CI 0.37-0.67, p<0.001) after adjusting for various confounders. In the 
following subgroup analysis, dexmedetomidine infusion was associated with 
decreased 28-day mortality in most subgroups.
CONCLUSIONS: Dexmedetomidine administration was significantly associated with 
reduced short-term mortality among patients with sepsis-associated 
encephalopathy in the ICU. However, it also prolonged ICU and hospital stays and 
increased the incidence of VAP.

BACKGROUND: Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) is a common nosocomial 
infection in the intensive care unit (ICU), with high in-hospital mortality. 
Current scoring systems are limited in predicting nosocomial death of VAP. This 
study aimed to develop and validate a more accurate and effective prediction 
model for in-hospital mortality in ICU patients with VAP.
METHODS: This was a retrospective cohort study. The demographic and clinical 
data of 8,182 adult patients with VAP were extracted from the Medical 
Information Mart for Intensive Care (MIMIC-III) database. All patients were 
randomly classified as a training set (n=4,629) and a test set (n=1,984) with a 
ratio of 7:3. The outcome was in-hospital mortality and the follow-up was 
terminated at discharge. Univariate and multivariate logistic regression 
analyses were used to identify the independent predictors and develop the 
prediction model in the training set, and internal validation was carried out in 
the test set. The receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve and calibration 
curve were plotted to evaluate the performance of the model.
RESULTS: Ethnicity, lung cancer history, septicemia history, hospital length of 
stay (LOS), fraction of inspired oxygen (FIO2) level, oxygen saturation (SPO2) 
level, Simplified Acute Physiology Score (SAPS II) score, Sequential Organ 
Failure Assessment (SOFA) score, and duration of invasive ventilation were all 
independently associated with the mortality of VAP. The algorithm of the 
prediction model was as follows: lnP/(1-P) = -0.700 + 0.493 Other Ethnicity + 
0.789 Lung Cancer (Yes) + 0.693 Septicemia (Yes) - 0.074 Hospital LOS - 0.008 
FIO2 - 0.032 SPO2 + 0.104 SOFA Score + 0.047 SAPS II + 0.004 Invasive 
Ventilation. The AUC was 0.837 in the training set and 0.817 in the test set, 
which indicated that the model performed well. The calibration curve also 
confirmed good calibration.
CONCLUSIONS: A model with good performance was developed to predict the 
individual death risk of VAP patients in the ICU, which might have the potential 
to provide ancillary data to support decision-making by physicians. External 
validation requires further evaluation of the model performance.

OBJECTIVES: Nonhepatic hyperammonemia often occurs in patients with sepsis. 
Ammonia plays an essential role in the occurrence of hepatic encephalopathy. 
However, the relationship between nonhepatic serum ammonia levels and 
sepsis-associated encephalopathy (SAE) remains unclear. Thus, we aimed to 
evaluate the association between serum ammonia levels and patients with SAE.
METHODS: Data of critically ill adults with sepsis who were admitted to the 
intensive care unit were retrieved from the Medical Information Mart for 
Intensive Care IV (MIMIC IV) between 2008 and 2019 and retrospectively analyzed. 
Data of patients with sepsis patients and serum ammonia not related to acute or 
chronic liver disease were not included.
RESULTS: Data from 720 patients with sepsis were included. SAE was found to have 
a high incidence (64.6%). After adjusting for other risk factors, a serum 
ammonia level of ≥45 μmol/L (odds ratio (OR): 3.508, 95% confidence interval 
(CI): 2.336-5.269, p < 0.001) was found to be an independent risk factor for 
patients with SAE; moreover, as the serum ammonia level increased, the hospital 
mortality of SAE gradually increased in a certain range (serum ammonia 
<150 μmol/L). Serum ammonia levels of ≥45 μmol/L were associated with higher 
Simplified Acute Physiology Score II and Sequential Organ Failure Assessment 
(SOFA) scores in patients with SAE. Besides, our study found that patients with 
SAE used opioid analgesics (OR:3.433, 95% CI: 1.360-8.669, p = 0.009) and the 
SOFA scores of patients with SAE (OR: 1.126, 95% CI: 1.062-1.194, p < 0.001) 
were significantly higher than those without SAE.
CONCLUSIONS: Nonhepatic serum ammonia levels of ≥45 μmol/L evidently increased 
the incidence of SAE. Serum ammonia levels should be closely monitored in 
patients with sepsis.

Sepsis is a clinical syndrome characterised by a severe disorder of 
pathophysiology caused by infection of pathogenic micro-organisms. The addition 
of antioxidant micronutrient therapies such as thiamine to sepsis treatment 
remains controversial. This study explored the effect of thiamine on the 
prognosis of patients with sepsis. This study was a retrospective study 
involving patients with sepsis from the Medical Information Mart for Intensive 
Care IV. Patients were divided into two groups, the thiamine received group (TR) 
and the thiamine unreceived group (TUR), according to whether they were 
supplemented with thiamin via intravenous while in the intensive care unit 
(ICU). The primary outcome was ICU mortality. The association between thiamine 
and outcome was analysed using the Cox proportional hazards regression model, 
propensity score matching (PSM), generalised boosted model-based inverse 
probability of treatment weighting (IPTW) and doubly robust estimation. A total 
of 11 553 sepsis patients were enrolled in this study. After controlling for 
potential confounders using Cox regression models, the TR group had a 
statistically significantly lower ICU mortality risk than the TUR group. The 
hazard ratio of ICU mortality for the TR group was 0·80 (95 % CI 0·70, 0·93). We 
obtained the same results after using PSM, IPTW and doubly robust estimation. 
Supplementation with thiamine has a beneficial effect on the prognosis of 
patients with sepsis. More randomised controlled trials are needed to confirm 
the effectiveness of thiamine supplementation in the treatment of sepsis.

PURPOSE: Sepsis with thrombocytopenia is highly prevalent in critically ill 
intensive care unit (ICU) patients and is associated with adverse outcomes. 
Platelet transfusion is the primary treatment of choice. However, evidence for 
the beneficial effects of platelet transfusion in patients with sepsis and 
thrombocytopenia is scarce and low in quality. This study aimed to evaluate the 
association between platelet transfusion and mortality among ICU patients with 
sepsis and thrombocytopenia.
PATIENTS AND METHODS: Using the Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care III 
database (v. 1.4), the outcomes of sepsis patients with platelet counts of ≤ 
150,000/μL were compared between those who did and did not receive platelet 
transfusion. The primary outcomes were 28- and 90-day all-cause mortalities. The 
secondary outcomes were red blood cell (RBC) transfusion, ICU-free days, and 
hospital-free days. Propensity score matching was employed to assemble a cohort 
of patients with similar baseline characteristics.
RESULTS: Among 7,765 eligible patients, 677 received platelet transfusion and 
were matched with 677 patients who did not receive platelet transfusion 
according to propensity scores. Platelet transfusion, as compared with no 
platelet transfusion, was associated with an increased risk of 28-day all-cause 
mortality [36.9 vs. 30.4%, odds ratio (OR), 1.21; 95% confidence interval (CI), 
1.01-1.46; p = 0.039], increased risk of 90-day all-cause mortality (50.8 vs. 
44.6%, OR, 1.13; 95% CI, 1.00-1.31; p = 0.048), fewer mean (standard deviation) 
28-day ICU-free days (15.88 ± 8.97 vs. 18.64 ± 8.33 days, p < 0.001), and fewer 
hospital-free days (10.29 ± 8.49 vs. 11.43 ± 8.85 days, p = 0.017). The rate of 
RBC transfusion was not significantly different between the platelet transfusion 
and non-transfusion groups (p = 0.149). The results were maintained across 
several subgroup and sensitivity analyses.
CONCLUSION: In this study, platelet transfusion was associated with higher 28- 
and 90-day all-cause mortalities. These results suggest the potential hazards of 
platelet transfusion in ICU patients with sepsis and thrombocytopenia.

BACKGROUND: Sepsis remains a leading cause of mortality in intensive care units 
(ICUs), with methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) infections 
presenting significant treatment challenges. The impact of MRSA co-infection on 
sepsis outcomes necessitates further exploration.
METHODS: We conducted a retrospective observational cohort study using the 
Medical Information Mart for Critical Care IV (MIMIC-IV-2.2) database. This 
cohort study included sepsis patients, scrutinizing baseline characteristics, 
MRSA co-infection, antimicrobial susceptibility, and their relations to 
mortality through Cox regression and Kaplan-Meier analyses.
RESULTS: Among 453 sepsis patients analyzed, significant baseline characteristic 
differences were observed between survivors (N = 324) and non-survivors (N = 
129). Notably, non-survivors were older (70.52 ± 14.95 vs. 64.42 ± 16.05, P < 
0.001), had higher lactate levels (2.82 ± 1.76 vs. 2.04 ± 1.56 mmol/L, P < 
0.001), and higher SOFA scores (8.36 ± 4.18 vs. 6.26 ± 3.65, P < 0.001). Cox 
regression highlighted SOFA score (HR = 1.122, P = 0.003), body temperature (HR 
= 0.825, P = 0.048), and age (HR = 1.030, P = 0.004) as significant predictors 
of 28-day mortality. MRSA co-infection was found in 98.7% of cases without a 
significant effect on 28-day mortality (P = 0.9). However, sensitivity to 
cephalosporins, meropenem, and piperacillin/tazobactam was associated with 
reduced mortality. The area under the ROC curve for the combined model of age, 
SOFA, and body temperature was 0.73, indicating a moderate predictive value for 
28-day mortality.
CONCLUSION: While MRSA co-infection's direct impact on 28-day sepsis mortality 
is minimal, antimicrobial sensitivity, especially to cephalosporins, meropenem, 
and piperacillin/tazobactam, plays a critical role in improving outcomes, 
underscoring the importance of antimicrobial stewardship and personalized 
treatment strategies in sepsis care.

BACKGROUND: The present study aimed to evaluate the association between 
normalized lactate load, an index that incorporates the magnitude of change and 
the time interval of such evolution of lactate, and 28-day mortality in sepsis 
and non-sepsis patients. We also compared the accuracy of normalized lactate 
load in predicting mortality between these two populations.
METHODS: Data were extracted from the Medical Information Mart for Intensive 
Care (MIMIC)-IV database. We defined lactate load as the sum of the area under 
the lactate concentration curve; we also defined normalized lactate load as the 
lactate load divided by time. The performance of maximum lactate, mean lactate 
and normalized lactate load in predicting 28-day mortality in sepsis and 
non-sepsis patients were compared by receiver-operating characteristic curves 
analysis.
RESULTS: A total of 21,333 patients were included (4219 sepsis and 17,114 
non-sepsis patients). Non-survivors had significantly higher normalized lactate 
load than survivors in sepsis and non-sepsis patients. The maximum lactate, mean 
lactate, and normalized lactate load AUCs were significantly greater in sepsis 
patients than in non-sepsis patients. Normalized lactate load had the greatest 
AUCs in predicting 28-day mortality in both sepsis and non-sepsis patients. 
Sensitivity analysis showed that the AUC of normalized lactate load increased in 
non-sepsis patients when more lactate measurement was obtained, but it was not 
improved in sepsis patients.
CONCLUSIONS: Normalized lactate load has the strongest predictive power compared 
with maximum or mean lactate in both sepsis and non-sepsis patients. The 
accuracy of normalized lactate load in predicting mortality is better in sepsis 
patients than in non-sepsis patients.

BACKGROUND: Acute kidney injury (AKI) is a frequent consequence of sepsis and 
has been linked to poor prognosis. In critically ill patients, the ratio of 
neutrophils to lymphocytes and platelets (N/LP) has been confirmed as an 
inflammation-related marker connected with the development of renal dysfunction. 
However, the effect of the N/LP ratio on the initiation and development of AKI 
in patients with sepsis remained unclear. The purpose of this study was to 
determine if the N/LP ratio on intensive care unit (ICU) admission was 
associated with the occurrence of sepsis-associated AKI (S-AKI) and severe AKI.
METHODS: Adult septic patients from the Medical Information Mart for Intensive 
Care-IV database were screened and classified into three categories (low, 
middle, or high) based on their N/LP ratio quartiles. The Cox proportional 
hazard and competing risk models were used to determine the risk of S-AKI in 
various N/LP groups, whilst the logistic regression model and restricted cubic 
splines (RCS) analysis were employed to investigate the link between N/LP ratios 
and the occurrence of severe AKI. Finally, we did a doubly robust estimation, a 
subgroup analysis, and a sensitivity analysis to determine the findings' 
robustness.
RESULTS: We categorized 485, 968, and 485 septic patients into three groups 
based on their N/LP ratios: low, intermediate, and high. According the Cox 
proportional hazard model, the hazard rate (95% CI) for those in the middle and 
high N/LP groups on the incidence of S-AKI were 1.30(1.07, 1.58) and 1.27(1.02, 
1.59), respectively, as compared to those in the low N/LP group. And the 
Fine-Gray proportional subdistribution hazards model indicated that mortality 
was not a substantial competing risk for S-AKI. Additionally, multivariate 
logistic regression revealed that the risk of severe AKI increased 1.83 fold in 
the high group compared to the low group. The RCS result also suggested that the 
probability of severe AKI rose significantly when N/LP > 9.5. The consistency of 
these findings was confirmed using doubly robust estimation. However, subgroup 
and sensitivity analyses revealed that the association between N/LP and the 
incidence of S-AKI, severe AKI varied considerably between different populations 
and diagnostic criteria.
CONCLUSION: A raised initial N/LP level may induce the development of S-AKI and 
severe AKI within 7 days after ICU admission in septic patients. These 
influences were enhanced in elder, male, septic shock, and those with poor 
health condition. Furthermore, high NLP was more strongly connected to the risk 
of S-AKI and severe AKI in sepsis patients on the urine output-based AKI 
criteria than on the serum creatinine-based criteria.

Adhering to bundle-based care recommendations within stringent time constraints 
presents a profound challenge. Elements within these bundles hold varying 
degrees of significance. We aimed to evaluate the Surviving Sepsis Campaign 
(SSC) hour-one bundle compliance patterns and their association with patient 
outcomes. Utilizing the Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care-IV 1.0 
dataset, this retrospective cohort study evaluated patients with sepsis who 
developed shock and were admitted to the intensive care unit between 2008 and 
2019. The execution of five hour-one bundle interventions were assessed. 
Patients with similar treatment profiles were categorized into clusters using 
unsupervised machine learning. Primary outcomes included in-hospital and 1-year 
mortality. Four clusters were identified: C#0 (n = 4716) had the poorest bundle 
compliance. C#1 (n = 1117) had perfect antibiotic adherence with modest fluid 
and serum lactate measurement adherence. C#2 (n = 850) exhibited full adherence 
to lactate measurement and low adherence to fluid administration, blood culture, 
and vasopressors, while C#3 (n = 381) achieved complete adherence to fluid 
administration and the highest adherence to vasopressor requirements in the 
entire cohort. Adjusting for covariates, C#1 and C#3 were associated with 
reduced odds of in-hospital mortality compared to C#0 (adjusted odds ratio 
[aOR] = 0·83; 95% confidence interval [CI] 0·7-0·97 and aOR = 0·7; 95% CI 
0·53-0·91, respectively). C#1 exhibited significantly better 1-year survival 
(adjusted hazard ratio [aHR] = 0·9; 95%CI 0·81-0·99). We were able to identify 
distinct clusters of SSC hour-one bundle adherence patterns using unsupervised 
machine learning techniques, which were associated with patient outcomes.

OBJECTIVE: To assess the effect of serum inorganic phosphate (Pi) on the 
prognosis of patients with sepsis.
METHODS: A retrospective analysis of patients with sepsis selected from the 
Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care (MIMIC)-IV database was performed. 
Sepsis was diagnosed according to the Third International Consensus Definition 
for sepsis and septic shock (Sepsis-3). The time-weighted values of the serum Pi 
measurements within the first 24 h of sepsis were analyzed. The association 
between serum Pi and in-hospital mortality was evaluated with a generalized 
linear model (log-binomial model).
RESULTS: The analysis of 11,658 patients from six intensive care units (ICUs) 
showed a nearly linear correlation between serum Pi and in-hospital mortality in 
all patients with sepsis, especially in those with acute kidney injury (AKI). 
The increase of serum Pi was related to a higher risk of AKI, higher 
norepinephrine doses, ICU mortality, and in-hospital mortality. The generalized 
linear model showed that serum Pi was an independent predictor for in-hospital 
mortality in all patients with sepsis even within the normal range. The adjusted 
risk ratios (RRs) were also significant in subgroup analyses according to kidney 
function, gender, respiratory infection, vasopressor use, and Sequential Organ 
Failure Assessment (SOFA) score.
CONCLUSION: Higher levels of serum Pi, even within the normal range, were 
significantly associated with a higher risk of in-hospital mortality in patients 
with sepsis regardless of kidney function, gender, respiratory infection, 
vasopressor use, and SOFA score.

Background Patients with chronic critical illness (CCI) experience poor 
prognoses and incur high medical costs. However, there is currently limited 
clinical awareness of sepsis-associated CCI, resulting in insufficient 
vigilance. Therefore, it is necessary to build a machine learning model that can 
predict whether sepsis patients will develop CCI. Methods Clinical data 
on 19,077 sepsis patients from the Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care 
IV (MIMIC-IV) database were analyzed. Predictive factors were identified using 
the Student's t-test, Mann-Whitney U test, or χ 2 test. Six machine learning 
classification models, namely, the logistic regression, support vector machine, 
decision tree, random forest, extreme gradient enhancement, and artificial 
neural network, were established. The optimal model was selected on the basis of 
its performance. Calibration curves were used to evaluate the accuracy of model 
classification, while the external validation dataset was used to evaluate the 
performance of the model. Results Thirty-seven characteristics, such as elevated 
alanine aminotransferase, rapid heart rate, and high Logistic Organ Dysfunction 
System scores, were identified as risk factors for developing CCI. The area 
under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUROC) values for all models 
were above 0.73 on the internal test set. Among them, the extreme gradient 
enhancement model exhibited superior performance (F1 score = 0.91, AUROC = 0.91, 
Brier score = 0.052). It also exhibited stable prediction performance on the 
external validation set (AUROC = 0.72). Conclusion A machine learning model was 
established to predict whether sepsis patients will develop CCI. It can provide 
useful predictive information for clinical decision-making.

BACKGROUND: Trauma has a high incidence and mortality worldwide, and sepsis is 
one of the main causes of mortality in trauma patients. Therefore, it is 
essential to identify the risk factors of in-hospital mortality for trauma 
patients with sepsis.
METHODS: Data were extracted from the Medical Information Mart for Intensive 
Care III database and divided into a training set and internal validation set, 
and another Chinese dataset was used as external validation set. Then, risk 
factors were estimated using univariate and multivariate logistic regression 
analyses in the training set. Finally, a nomogram was created to predict the 
probability of in-hospital mortality for trauma patients with sepsis.
RESULTS: A total of 503 patients were enrolled in our study (335 in the training 
set and 168 in the validation set). Multivariate logistic regression analysis 
revealed that age (1.047 [1.025-1.071]), respiratory rate (1.258 [1.135-1.394]), 
PTT (1.026 [1.008-1.044]), ventilation (6.703 [1.528-29.408]), and vasopressor 
use (3.682 [1.502-9.025]) were independent factors associated with in-hospital 
mortality. The nomogram for trauma-related sepsis predicted in-hospital 
mortality with AUC values of 0.8939 in the training set, 0.8200 in the internal 
validation set, and 0.7779 in the external validation set.
CONCLUSIONS: The new nomogram has a well predicted value for in-hospital 
mortality for patients with trauma and sepsis in intensive care units.

BACKGROUND: Sepsis is the second-leading cause of death in neonates. We 
established a predictive nomogram to identify critically ill neonates early and 
reduce the time to treatment.
METHODS: It is a retrospective case-control study based on the MIMIC-III 
database. The study population comprised 924 neonates diagnosed with sepsis.
RESULTS: Neonates with sepsis included in the MIMIC-III database were enrolled, 
including 880 surviving neonates and 44 neonates who died. In the derivation 
dataset, stepwise regression and the Lasso algorithm were employed to select 
predictive variables, and the neonatal sequential organ failure assessment score 
(nSOFA) was calculated simultaneously. Bootstrap resampling was utilized to 
perform internal validation. The results indicated that the Lasso algorithm 
displayed superior discrimination, sensitivity, and specificity relative to 
stepwise regression and nSOFA scores. After 500 bootstrap resampling tests, the 
area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) of the Lasso 
algorithm was 0.912 (95% CI: 0.870-0.977). The nomogram based on the Lasso 
algorithm outperformed stepwise regression and nSOFA scores in terms of 
calibration and the clinical net benefit. This nomogram can assist in 
prognosticating neonatal severe sepsis and aid in guiding clinical practice 
while concurrently improving patient outcomes.
CONCLUSIONS: The established nomogram revealed that jaundice, corticosteroid 
use, weight, serum calcium, inotropes and base excess are all important 
predictors of 28-day mortality in neonates with sepsis. This nomogram can 
facilitate the early identification of neonates with severe sepsis. However, it 
still requires further modiﬁcation and external validation to make it widely 
available.

OBJECTIVES: Acute respiratory failure increases short-term mortality in sepsis 
patients. Hence, in this study, we aimed to develop a novel model for predicting 
the risk of hospital mortality in sepsis patients with acute respiratory 
failure.
METHODS: From the Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care (MIMIC)-IV 
database, we developed a matched cohort of adult sepsis patients with acute 
respiratory failure. After applying a multivariate COX regression analysis, we 
developed a nomogram based on the identified risk factors of mortality. Further, 
we evaluated the ability of the nomogram in predicting individual hospital death 
by the area under a receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve.
RESULTS: A total of 663 sepsis patients with acute respiratory failure were 
included in this study. Systolic blood pressure, neutrophil percentage, white 
blood cells count, mechanical ventilation, partial pressure of oxygen < 60 mmHg, 
abdominal cavity infection, Klebsiella pneumoniae and Acinetobacter baumannii 
infection, and immunosuppressive diseases were the independent risk factors of 
mortality in sepsis patients with acute respiratory failure. The area under the 
ROC curve of the nomogram was 0.880 (95% CI: 0.851-0.908), which provided 
significantly higher discrimination compared to that of the simplified acute 
physiology score II [0.656 (95% CI: 0.612-0.701)].
CONCLUSION: The model shows a good performance in predicting the mortality risk 
of patients with sepsis-related acute respiratory failure. Hence, this model can 
be used to evaluate the short-term prognosis of critically ill patients with 
sepsis and acute respiratory failure.

Sepsis is defined by life-threatening organ dysfunction during infection and is 
the leading cause of death in hospitals. During sepsis, there is a high risk 
that new onset of atrial fibrillation (AF) can occur, which is associated with 
significant morbidity and mortality. Consequently, early prediction of AF during 
sepsis would allow testing of interventions in the intensive care unit (ICU) to 
prevent AF and its severe complications. In this paper, we present a novel 
automated AF prediction algorithm for critically ill sepsis patients using 
electrocardiogram (ECG) signals. From the heart rate signal collected from 5-min 
ECG, feature extraction is performed using the traditional time, frequency, and 
nonlinear domain methods. Moreover, variable frequency complex demodulation and 
tunable Q-factor wavelet-transform-based time-frequency methods are applied to 
extract novel features from the heart rate signal. Using a selected feature 
subset, several machine learning classifiers, including support vector machine 
(SVM) and random forest (RF), were trained using only the 2001 Computers in 
Cardiology data set. For testing the proposed method, 50 critically ill ICU 
subjects from the Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care (MIMIC) III 
database were used in this study. Using distinct and independent testing data 
from MIMIC III, the SVM achieved 80% sensitivity, 100% specificity, 90% 
accuracy, 100% positive predictive value, and 83.33% negative predictive value 
for predicting AF immediately prior to the onset of AF, while the RF achieved 
88% AF prediction accuracy. When we analyzed how much in advance we can predict 
AF events in critically ill sepsis patients, the algorithm achieved 80% accuracy 
for predicting AF events 10 min early. Our algorithm outperformed a 
state-of-the-art method for predicting AF in ICU patients, further demonstrating 
the efficacy of our proposed method. The annotations of patients' AF transition 
information will be made publicly available for other investigators. Our 
algorithm to predict AF onset is applicable for any ECG modality including patch 
electrodes and wearables, including Holter, loop recorder, and implantable 
devices.

BACKGROUND Hyperammonemia has been reported in some critically ill patients with 
sepsis who do not have hepatic failure. A significant proportion of patients 
with non-hepatic hyperammonemia have underlying sepsis, but the association 
between non-hepatic hyperammonemia and prognosis is unclear. MATERIAL AND 
METHODS Information about patients with sepsis and non-hepatic hyperammonemia 
was retrieved from the Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care-III database. 
Survival rates were analyzed using the Kaplan-Meier method. Multivariate 
logistic regression models were employed to identify prognostic factors. 
Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis was used to measure the 
predictive ability of ammonia in terms of patient mortality. RESULTS A total of 
265 patients with sepsis were enrolled in this study. Compared with the 
non-hyperammonemia group, the patients with hyperammonemia had significantly 
higher rates of hospital (59.8% vs. 43.0%, P=0.007), 30-day (47.7% vs. 34.8%, 
P=0.036), 90-day (61.7% vs. 43.7%, P=0.004), and 1-year mortality (67.3% vs. 
49.4%, P=0.004). In the survival analysis, hyperammonemia was associated with 
these outcomes. Serum ammonia level was an independent predictor of hospital 
mortality. The area under the ROC curve for the ammonia levels had poor 
discriminative capacity. The hyperammonemia group also had significantly lower 
Glasgow Coma Scale scores (P=0.020) and higher incidences of delirium (15.9% vs. 
8.2%, P=0.034) and encephalopathy (37.4% vs. 19.6%, P=0.001). Intestinal 
infection and urinary tract infection with organisms such as Escherichia coli 
may be risk factors for hyperammonemia in patients who have sepsis. CONCLUSIONS 
Higher ammonia levels are associated with poorer prognosis in patients with 
sepsis. Ammonia also may be associated with sepsis-associated encephalopathy. 
Therefore, we recommend that serum ammonia levels be measured in patients who 
are suspected of having sepsis.

BACKGROUND: The effects of diastolic arterial pressure (DAP) and heart rate (HR) 
on the prognosis of patients with septic shock are unclear, and whether these 
effects persist over time is unknown. We aimed to investigate the relationship 
between exposure to different intensities of DAP and HR over time and mortality 
at 28 days in patients with septic shock.
METHODS: In this cohort study, we obtained data from the Medical Information 
Mart for Intensive Care IV, which includes the data of adult patients 
(≥ 18 years) with septic shock who underwent invasive blood pressure monitoring. 
We excluded patients who received extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) or 
glucocorticoids within 48 h of ICU admission. The primary outcome was mortality 
at 28 days. Piece-wise exponential additive mixed models were used to estimate 
the strength of the associations over time.
RESULTS: In total, 4959 patients were finally included. The median length of 
stay in the ICU was 3.2 days (IQR: 1.5-7.1 days), and the mortality in the ICU 
was 12.9%, with a total mortality at 28 days of 15.9%. After adjustment for 
baseline and time-dependent confounders, both daily time-weighted average (TWA) 
DAP and HR were associated with increased mortality at 28 days and strong 
association, mainly in the early to mid-stages of the disease. The results 
showed that mortality in patients with septic shock was lowest at a DAP of 
50-70 mm Hg and an HR of 60-90 beats per minute (bpm). Throughout, a significant 
increase in the risk of death was found with daily exposure to TWA-DAP ≤ 40 mmHg 
(hazard ratio 0.99, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.94-1.03) or TWA-HR ≥ 100 bpm 
(hazard ratio 1.16, 95% CI 1.1-1.21). Cumulative and interactive effects of 
harmful exposure (TWA-DAP ≤ 40 mmHg and TWA-HR ≥ 100 bpm) were also observed.
CONCLUSION: The optimal ranges for DAP and HR in patients with septic shock are 
50-70 mmHg and 60-90 bpm, respectively. The cumulative and interactive effects 
of exposure to low DAP (≤ 40 mmHg) and tachycardia (≥ 100 bpm) were associated 
with an increased risk of death.

Background: Serum calcium levels disorder have been reported to be associated 
with poor prognosis in different diseases. Studies on the association between 
serum calcium and outcomes of septic patients remained limited. The aim of this 
study is to investigate the association between serum calcium and 28-day 
mortality in septic patients. Method: Patients diagnosed with sepsis in the 
Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care III database were included. Patients 
were divided into five groups according to the quintiles of serum calcium 
levels, and their baseline characteristics were compared. Multivariate Cox 
regression models were used to assess the association between serum calcium and 
28-day mortality. Smooth curve fitting and segmented regression models were used 
to visualize the association between serum calcium levels and 28-day mortality 
risk. The 28-day survival probability between five groups was analyzed using 
Kaplan-Meier curves. Results: A total of 3,016 patients with sepsis were 
enrolled, and the 28-day mortality rate was 35.64%. After adjusting for 
confounders, compared with the reference quintile (Q4: 9.00-9.50), the lowest 
serum calcium level quintile (Q1: 5.70-8.20) was independently associated with 
an increased risk of 28-day mortality (hazard ratio [HR], 2.12; 95% CI, 
1.76-2.56). Smooth spline fitting revealed a U-shaped association between serum 
calcium and 28-day mortality. When serum calcium was <9.0 mg/dL, 28-day 
mortality risk increased by 58% per unit decrease in serum calcium (HR, 0.42; 
95% CI, 0.37-0.48). When serum calcium was >9.0 mg/dL, the 28-day mortality risk 
increased by 12% per unit increase in serum calcium (HR, 1.12; 95% CI, 
1.04-1.20). Conclusion: A U-shaped association was observed between serum 
calcium levels and 28-day mortality in septic patients. Lower or higher serum 
calcium levels were associated with increased risk of 28-day mortality in septic 
patients.

BACKGROUND: Acute kidney injury (AKI) is a prevalent and severe complication of 
sepsis contributing to high morbidity and mortality among critically ill 
patients. In this retrospective study, we develop a novel risk-predicted 
nomogram of sepsis associated-AKI (SA-AKI).
METHODS: A total of 2,871 patients from the Medical Information Mart for 
Intensive Care III (MIMIC-III) critical care database were randomly assigned to 
primary (2,012 patients) and validation (859 patients) cohorts. A risk-predicted 
nomogram for SA-AKI was developed through multivariate logistic regression 
analysis in the primary cohort while the nomogram was evaluated in the 
validation cohort. Nomogram discrimination and calibration were assessed using 
C-index and calibration curves in the primary and external validation cohorts. 
The clinical utility of the final nomogram was evaluated using decision curve 
analysis.
RESULTS: Risk predictors included in the prediction nomogram included length of 
stay in intensive care unit (LOS in ICU), baseline serum creatinine (SCr), 
glucose, anemia, and vasoactive drugs. Nomogram revealed moderate discrimination 
and calibration in estimating the risk of SA-AKI, with an unadjusted C-index of 
0.752, 95 %Cl (0.730-0.774), and a bootstrap-corrected C index of 0.749. 
Application of the nomogram in the validation cohort provided moderate 
discrimination (C-index, 0.757 [95 % CI, 0.724-0.790]) and good calibration. 
Besides, the decision curve analysis (DCA) confirmed the clinical usefulness of 
the nomogram.
CONCLUSIONS: This study developed and validated an AKI risk prediction nomogram 
applied to critically ill patients with sepsis, which may help identify 
reasonable risk judgments and treatment strategies to a certain extent. 
Nevertheless, further verification using external data is essential to enhance 
its applicability in clinical practice.

BACKGROUND: Few studies have reported the risk factors or developed a risk 
predictive model of hypoglycemia patients with sepsis.
OBJECTIVE: To develop a predictive model to assess the hypoglycemia risk in 
critically ill patients with sepsis.
METHODS: For this retrospective study, we collected the data from the Medical 
Information Mart for Intensive Care III and IV (MIMIC-III and MIMIC-IV). All 
eligible patients from the MIMIC-III were randomly divided into the training set 
for development of predictive model and testing set for internal validation of 
the predictive model at a ratio of 8:2. Patients from the MIMIC-IV database were 
used as the external validation set. The primary endpoint was the occurrence of 
hypoglycemia. Univariate and multivariate logistic model was used to screen 
predictors. Adopted receiver operating characteristics (ROC) and calibration 
curves to estimate the performance of the nomogram.
RESULTS: The median follow-up time was 5.13 (2.61-9.79) days. Diabetes, 
dyslipidemia, mean arterial pressure, anion gap, hematocrit, albumin, sequential 
organ failure assessment, vasopressors, mechanical ventilation and insulin were 
identified as the predictors for hypoglycemia risk in critically ill patients 
with sepsis. We constructed a nomogram for predicting hypoglycemia risk in 
critically ill patients with sepsis based on these predictors. An online 
individualized predictive tool: https://ghongyang.shinyapps.io/DynNomapp/. The 
established nomogram had a good predictive ability by ROC and calibration curves 
in the training set, testing set and external validation cohort.
CONCLUSION: A predictive model of hypoglycemia risk was constructed, with a good 
ability in predicting the risk of hypoglycemia in critically ill patients with 
sepsis.

OBJECTIVES: Vasopressors are a cornerstone in the management of sepsis, marked 
by distributive shock often unresponsive to fluid resuscitation. Prior research 
and clinician surveys have suggested that earlier usage of vasopressors 
corresponds to improved outcomes.
METHODS: A retrospective cohort was constructed using patient data contained 
within the Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care-IV database. Analytic 
cohort included a total of 2079 patients meeting sepsis-3 criteria with a 
≥2-point rise in Sequential Organ Failure Assessment score and administered 
norepinephrine (NE) as first-line vasopressor within 24 hours of admission to 
the intensive care unit (ICU). Patients receiving other vasopressors or missing 
documented fluid resuscitation information were excluded. Primary end points 
included mortality, use of invasive mechanical ventilation and length of stay 
which were analyzed in a multivariate logistic regression model for the primary 
effect of time from ICU admission to NE administration using covariates.
RESULTS: Time to NE use was defined as either early, using <6 hours from time of 
ICU admission or late using >6 hours to ≤24 hours. Patients who received early 
NE had significantly lower adjusted odds of mortality (0.75, 95% CI 0.57 to 
0.97, p=0.026), higher adjusted odds of invasive mechanical ventilation (1.48, 
95% CI 1.01 to 2.16, p=0.045), no significant difference in hospital length of 
stay (difference in days 0.6 (95% CI -3.24 to 2.04)) and lower ICU length of 
stay (difference in days -0.9 (95% CI -1.74 to -0.01)), as compared with the 
late NE group.
CONCLUSION: Among patients admitted to the ICU for sepsis, early use of NE was 
associated with significantly lower odds of mortality but higher odds of 
mechanical ventilation, and no significant difference in length of hospital stay 
but less time in the ICU. Furthermore, the volume of fluids received prior to NE 
use may have a significant impact on optimal NE timing.

BACKGROUND: Sepsis-associated acute kidney injury (SA-AKI) is a severe 
complication associated with poorer prognosis and increased mortality, 
particularly in elderly patients. Currently, there is a lack of accurate 
mortality risk prediction models for these patients in clinic.
OBJECTIVES: This study aimed to develop and validate machine learning models for 
predicting in-hospital mortality risk in elderly patients with SA-AKI.
METHODS: Machine learning models were developed and validated using the public, 
high-quality Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care (MIMIC)-IV critically 
ill database. The recursive feature elimination (RFE) algorithm was employed for 
key feature selection. Eleven predictive models were compared, with the best one 
selected for further validation. Shapley Additive Explanations (SHAP) values 
were used for visualization and interpretation, making the machine learning 
models clinically interpretable.
RESULTS: There were 16,154 patients with SA-AKI in the MIMIC-IV database, and 
8426 SA-AKI patients were included in this study (median age: 77.0 years; 
female: 45%). 7728 patients excluded based on these criteria. They were randomly 
divided into a training cohort (5,934, 70%) and a validation cohort (2,492, 
30%). Nine key features were selected by the RFE algorithm. The CatBoost model 
achieved the best performance, with an AUC of 0.844 in the training cohort and 
0.804 in the validation cohort. SHAP values revealed that AKI stage, PaO2, and 
lactate were the top three most important features contributing to the CatBoost 
model.
CONCLUSION: We developed a model capable of predicting the risk of in-hospital 
mortality in elderly patients with SA-AKI.

BACKGROUND: Previous studies have shown that dexmedetomidine (DEX) may be 
associated with reduced vasopressor requirements in septic shock patients, 
however, long-term DEX-only sedation in reducing vasopressor requirements is 
still controversial.
METHODS: A retrospective study was conducted among patients with septic shock on 
mechanical ventilation using the Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care IV 
(MIMIC-IV) database. The primary outcome was the ratio of norepinephrine 
equivalent dose to mean arterial pressure (NEq/MAP) in the first 72 h after DEX 
or other sedatives for sedation. The secondary outcomes were key organ function 
parameters, 28-day mortality, and 90-day mortality. Univariate, propensity score 
matching (PSM), and generalized linear mixed model (GLMM) analyses were 
performed.
RESULTS: DEX was associated with decreased NEq/MAP in the first 72 h 
(difference = 0.05, 95% CI = -0.02-0.08, p = 0.002) after adjusting for 
confounders in the GLMM analysis. The DEX group was also associated with a lower 
heart rate, cardiac output (CO), lactate level, aspartate transaminase (AST) 
level, and higher PaO2/FiO2 ratio (p < 0.0125). Moreover, DEX only sedation was 
associated with reduced 90-day mortality (OR = 0.60, 95% CI = 0.37-0.94, 
p = 0.030).
CONCLUSION: DEX may be associated with decreased vasopressor requirements, 
improved AST and PaO2/FiO2 levels, and reduced 90-day mortality in patients with 
septic shock, which warrants further study.

OBJECTIVES: Approximately one-third of patients with sepsis-associated acute 
kidney injury (AKI) progress to acute kidney disease (AKD) with higher 
short-term mortality. We aimed to identify the clinical characteristics that 
influence in-hospital death in sepsis-associated AKD and develop a nomogram to 
facilitate early warning.
METHODS: Logical regression was applied to screen variables based on clinical 
data from the Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care IV (MIMIC-IV) 
database. A nomogram was established to predict in-hospital death risk in 
patients with sepsis-associated AKD. The eICU Collaborative Research Database 
(eICU-CRD) was used for external validation. The receiver operating 
characteristic and calibration curves were used to determine the model's 
performance.
RESULTS: A total of 1,779 patients with sepsis-associated AKD were included from 
the MIMIC-IV and 344 from the eICU-CRD. Age, Glasgow coma scale score, systolic 
blood pressure, peripheral oxygen saturation, platelet count, white blood cell 
count, and bicarbonate levels were significantly correlated with death. The 
nomogram demonstrated high discrimination in the training (C-index, 0.829; 95% 
confidence interval [CI] [0.807-0.852]) and testing sets (C-index: 0.760; 95% CI 
[0.706-0.814]). At the optimal cut-off value of 0.270, the model's sensitivity 
in the training and validation datasets was 72.8% (95% CI [68.3-76.9%]) and 
64.5% (95% CI [54.9-73.4%]), while the specificity was 79.2% (95% CI 
[76.9-81.4%]) and 74.8% (95% CI [68.7-80.2%]), respectively.
CONCLUSION: We identified seven predictors of in-hospital death in patients with 
sepsis-associated AKD. In addition, we developed an online dynamic nomogram to 
accurately and conveniently predict short-term outcomes, which performed well in 
the external dataset.

BACKGROUND: Previous studies suggest that septic patients often have elevated 
triglyceride levels due to various factors, and higher levels may indicate a 
poorer prognosis. However, few studies have investigated whether lower 
triglycerides are associated with a better prognosis.
METHODS: The Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care IV (MIMIC-IV) database 
provided all the data. To assess the association between triglycerides and 
prognosis, we used logistic regression analysis (LR), least absolute shrinkage 
and selection operator (LASSO) and Cox proportional hazards models.
RESULTS: Inclusion criteria were met by a total of 804 patients with a mean 
triglyceride of 103 mg/dL. We found that patients had a higher risk of 30-day 
ICU mortality when triglycerides were in the second quartile (74-103 mg/dL). 
Interestingly, this group of patients seems to benefit more from the use of 
atorvastatin.
CONCLUSION: Our study showed that septic patients with triglyceride levels in 
the second quartile (74-103 mg/dL) have a higher 30-day ICU mortality rate 
compared to those with triglyceride levels in other quartiles.

BACKGROUND: The mortality rate of sepsis-associated liver injury (SALI) is 
relatively high, but there is currently no authoritative prognostic criterion 
for the outcome of SALI. Meanwhile, lactate-to-albumin ratio (LAR) has been 
confirmed to be associated with mortality rates in conditions such as sepsis, 
heart failure, and respiratory failure. However, there is a scarcity of research 
reporting on the association between LAR and SALI. This study aimed to elucidate 
the association between LAR and the 28-day mortality rate of SALI.
METHODS: In this retrospective cohort study, data were obtained from the Medical 
Information Mart for Intensive Care IV (v2.2). Adult patients with SALI were 
admitted to the intensive care unit in this study. The LAR level at admission 
was included, and the primary aim was to assess the relationship between the LAR 
and 28-day all-cause mortality.
RESULTS: A total of 341 patients with SALI (SALI) were screened. They were 
divided into a survival group (241) and a non-survival group (100), and the 
28-day mortality rate was 29.3%. Multivariable Cox regression analysis revealed 
that for every 1-unit increase in LAR, the 28-day mortality risk for SALI 
patients increased by 21%, with an HR of 1.21 (95% CI 1.11 ~ 1.31, p < 0.001).
CONCLUSIONS: This study indicates that in patients with SALI, a higher LAR is 
associated with an increased risk of all-cause mortality within 28 days of 
admission. This suggests that LAR may serve as an independent risk factor for 
adverse outcomes in SALI patients.

Sepsis-associated acute kidney injury (S-AKI) is very common and early 
prediction is beneficial. This study aiming to develop an accurate ensemble 
model to predict the risk of S-AKI based on easily available clinical 
information. Patients with sepsis from the United States (US) database Medical 
Information Mart for Intensive Care-IV were used as a modeling cohort to predict 
the occurrence of AKI by combining Support Vector Machine, Random Forest, Neural 
Network, and Extreme Gradient Boost as four first-level learners via stacking 
algorithm. The external validation databases were the eICU Collaborative 
Research Database from US and Critical Care Database comprising infection 
patients at Zigong Fourth People's Hospital from China, whose AUROC values for 
the ensemble model 48-12 h before the onset of AKI were 0.774-0.788 and 
0.756-0.813, respectively. In this study, an ensemble model for early prediction 
of S-AKI onset was developed and it demonstrated good performance in multicenter 
external datasets.

BACKGROUND: A great increase in the number of patients needs critical care to 
the intensive care unit (ICU) due to improvements in oncology. The aim of the 
study was to explore risk factors affecting survival of critically ill patients 
with solid cancers in ICU.
METHODS: The study retrospectively reviewed patients between 2001 and 2012, 
which were collected by Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care III 
(MIMIC-III) from the Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center in Boston, MA, USA.
RESULTS: A total of 38,508 adult patients, who were admitted to ICUs and 8,308 
(21.6%) were diagnosed as an underlying malignancy; 1,671 and 3,165 adult 
patients with sold cancer were admitted to surgical ICU (SICU) and medical ICU 
(MICU), respectively. Patients in SICU had a higher survival rate at the point 
of 28-, 90-day, and 1-, 3-year than patients in MICU (P<0.001 for all). 
Multivariate analysis demonstrated that age ≥70, emergency admission, the 
presence of metastases, Oxford Acute Severity of Illness Score (OASIS) ≥30 and 
sepsis were independent risk factors affecting 28-day survival in SICU. In MICU, 
emergency admission, metastatic disease, Sequential Organ Failure Assessment 
(SOFA) ≥3, Simplified Acute Physiology Score II (SAPS II) ≥39, Acute Physiology 
Score III (APS III) ≥40, Oxford Acute Severity of Illness Score (OASIS) ≥30, 
Elixhauser comorbidity index ≥9 and sepsis were independent risk factors for 
28-day survival rate. The area under curve (AUC) of the OASIS for predicting ICU 
mortality was 0.824 [95% confidence interval (CI): 0.805-0.842], which was 
obviously higher than other scores in SICU. The AUC of the SAPS II for 
predicting ICU mortality was 0.820 (95% CI: 0.806-0.833), which was slightly 
higher than other scores in MICU.
CONCLUSIONS: Patients with cancer in SICU have longer survival time than 
patients with cancer in MICU. The prediction of prognosis of critically ill 
cancer patients can guide treatment and optimize medical resources.

BACKGROUND: Sepsis continues to carry a high rate of mortality, which makes 
effective and simple evaluation methods for predicting the prognosis of septic 
patients especially important. In this study, we retrospectively analyzed the 
relationships between three scoring systems including Sequential Organ Failure 
Assessment (SOFA) score, Quick SOFA (qSOFA) score, and Logistic Organ 
Dysfunction System (LODS) score and the prognoses of septic patients.
METHODS: The baseline data, SOFA score, qSOFA score, LODS score, 28-day 
prognosis, and 90-day prognosis of patients who met the diagnostic criteria of 
sepsis were retrieved from the Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care III 
(MIMIC-III) database. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves were drawn 
for various indicators, and comparisons were drawn between the areas under the 
ROC curves (AUC) of the different scoring systems.
RESULTS: The 28-day AUC was 0.661 (0.652, 0.670) for SOFA, 0.558 (0.548, 0.568) 
for qSOFA, and 0.668 (0.658, 0.677) for LODS; AUC-qSOFA vs. AUC-LODS was 0.103 
(0.087, 0.120) (P<0.001), and AUC-qSOFA vs. AUC-LODS was 0.110 (0.094, 0.125) 
(P<0.001). The 90-day AUC was 0.630 (0.621, 0.640) for SOFA, 0.551 (0.541, 
0.560) for qSOFA, and 0.644 (0.635, 0.653) for LODS; AUC-SOFA vs. AUC-qSOFA was 
0.079 (0.065, 0.094) (P<0.001), and AUC-qSOFA vs. AUC-LODS was 0.093 (0.079, 
0.107) (P<0.001).
CONCLUSIONS: SOFA score, qSOFA score, and LODS score can all be used to predict 
the prognosis of septic patients. LODS score and SOFA score have higher accuracy 
than qSOFA score; however, qSOFA is simpler to use, making it a more suitable 
tool in an emergency setting.

OBJECTIVE: The relationship between base excess (BE) and 28-day death in sepsis 
patients remains to be elucidated. The aim of our clinical study is to explore 
the association of BE with 28-day mortality in patients with sepsis by using a 
large sample, multicenter Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care IV 
(MIMIC-IV) database.
METHODS: We extracted the data of 35,010 patients with sepsis from the MIMIC-IV 
database, in which we used BE as an exposure variable and the 28-day mortality 
as an outcome variable, respectively, so as to explore the impact of BE on the 
28-day mortality of patients with sepsis after adjusting for covariates.
RESULTS: BE and the 28-day mortality of patients with sepsis appeared to have a 
U-shaped relationship. The calculated inflection points were -2.5 mEq/L and 
1.9 mEq/L, respectively. Our data demonstrated that BE was negatively associated 
with 28-day mortality in the range of -41.0 mEq/L to -2.5 mEq/L (odds ratio: 
0.95; 95% confidence intervals (95%CI): 0.93 to 0.96), p < 0.0001. When BE was 
in the range of 1.9 mEq/L to 55.5 mEq/L, however, a positive association existed 
between BE and 28-day mortality of patients with sepsis (odds ratio: 1.03; 95% 
CI: 1.00 to 1.05; p < 0.05).
CONCLUSION: The BE levels have a U-shaped relationship with the 28-day mortality 
in patients with sepsis, in which the mortality of patients will gradually 
decrease with a BE value from -41.0 mEq/L to -2.5 mEq/L, while the mortality 
will increase with a BE value from 1.9 mEq/L to 55.5 mEq/L.

OBJECTIVE: Early identifying sepsis patients who had higher risk of poor 
prognosis was extremely important. The aim of this study was to develop an 
artificial neural networks (ANN) model for early predicting clinical outcomes in 
sepsis.
METHODS: This study was a retrospective design. Sepsis patients from the Medical 
Information Mart for Intensive Care-III (MIMIC-III) database were enrolled. A 
predictive model for predicting 30-day morality in sepsis was performed based on 
the ANN approach.
RESULTS: A total of 2874 patients with sepsis were included and 30-day mortality 
was 29.8%. The study population was categorized into the training set (n = 1698) 
and validation set (n = 1176) based on the ratio of 6:4. 11 variables which 
showed significant differences between survivor group and nonsurvivor group in 
training set were selected for constructing the ANN model. In training set, the 
predictive performance based on the area under the receiver-operating 
characteristic curve (AUC) were 0.873 for ANN model, 0.720 for logistic 
regression, 0.629 for APACHEII score and 0.619 for SOFA score. In validation 
set, the AUCs of ANN, logistic regression, APAHCEII score, and SOFA score were 
0.811, 0.752, 0.607, and 0.628, respectively.
CONCLUSION: An ANN model for predicting 30-day mortality in sepsis was 
performed. Our predictive model can be beneficial for early detection of 
patients with higher risk of poor prognosis.

PURPOSE: Acute cholangitis (AC) is a widespread acute inflammatory disease and 
the main cause of septic shock, which has a high death rate in hospitals. At 
present, the prediction models for short-term mortality of AC patients are still 
not ideal. We aimed at developing a new model that could forecast the short-term 
mortality rate of AC patients.
METHODS: Data were extracted from the Medical Information Mart for Intensive 
Care IV version 2.0 (MIMIC-IV v2.0). There were a total of 506 cases of AC 
patients that were included. Patients were given a 7 : 3 split between the 
training set and the validation set after being randomly assigned to one of the 
groups. Multivariate logistic regression was used to create an AC patient 
predictive nomogram for 30-day mortality. The overall efficacy of the model is 
evaluated using the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve 
(AUC), the calibration curve, the net reclassification improvement (NRI), the 
integrated discrimination improvement (IDI), and a decision curve analysis 
(DCA).
RESULTS: Out of 506 patients, 14.0% (71 patients) died. The training cohort had 
354 patients, and the validation cohort had 152 patients. GCS, SPO2, albumin, 
AST/ALT, glucose, potassium, PTT, and peripheral vascular disease were the 
independent risk factors according to the multivariate analysis results. The 
newly established nomogram had better prediction performance than other common 
scoring systems (such as SOFA, OASIS, and SAPS II). For two cohorts, the 
calibration curve demonstrated coherence between the nomogram and the ideal 
observation (P  >  0.05). The clinical utility of the nomogram in both sets was 
revealed by decision curve analysis.
CONCLUSION: The novel prognostic model was effective in forecasting the 30-day 
mortality rate for acute cholangitis patients.

BACKGROUND: Sepsis still threatens the lives of more than 300 million patients 
annually and elderly patients with sepsis usually have a more complicated 
condition and a worse prognosis. Existing studies have shown that both 
Hematocrit (HCT) and albumin (ALB) can be used as potential predictors of 
sepsis, and their difference HCT-ALB has a significant capacity to diagnose 
infectious diseases. Currently, there is no relevant research on the 
relationship between HCT-ALB and the prognosis of elderly sepsis patients. 
Therefore, this study aims to explore the association between HCT-ALB and 
mortality in elderly patients with sepsis.
METHODS: This study was a multi-center retrospective study based on the Medical 
Information Mart for Intensive Care (MIMIC-IV) database and the eICU 
Collaborative Research Database (eICU-CRD) in elderly patients with sepsis. The 
optimal HCT-ALB cut-off point for ICU mortality was calculated by the Youden 
Index based on the eICU-CRD dataset, and multivariate logistic regressions were 
conducted to explore the association between HCT-ALB and ICU/hospital mortality 
in the two databases. Subgroup analyses were performed for different parameters 
and comorbidity status.
RESULTS: The number of 16,127 and 3043 elderly sepsis patients were selected 
from two large intensive care databases (eICU-CRD and MIMIC-IV, respectively) in 
this study. Depending on the optimal cut-off point, patients in both eICU-CRD 
and MIMIC-IV were independently divided into low HCT-ALB (< 6.7) and high 
HCT-ALB (≥ 6.7) groups. The odds ratio (95%confidence interval) [OR (95CI%)] of 
the high HCT-ALB group were 1.50 (1.36,1.65) and 1.71 (1.58,1.87) for ICU and 
hospital mortality in the eICU-CRD database after multivariable adjustment. 
Similar trends in the ICU and hospital mortality [OR (95%CI) 1.41 (1.15,1.72) 
and 1.27 (1.07,1.51)] were observed in MIMIC-IV database. Subgroup analysis 
showed an interaction effect with SOFA score in the eICU-CRD database however 
not in MIMIC-IV dataset.
CONCLUSIONS: High HCT-ALB (≥ 6.7) is associated with 1.41 and 1.27 times ICU and 
hospital mortality risk in elderly patients with sepsis. HCT-ALB is simple and 
easy to obtain and is a promising clinical predictor of early risk 
stratification for elderly sepsis patients in ICU.

BACKGROUND: An index of dynamic lactate change that incorporates both the 
magnitude of change and the time interval of such change, termed "normalized 
lactate load," may reflect the hypoxic burden of septic shock. We aimed to 
evaluate the association between normalized lactate load and 28-day mortality in 
adult septic shock patients.
METHODS: Patients with septic shock were identified from the Medical Information 
Mart for Intensive Care (MIMIC)-III database. Lactate load was defined as the 
sum of the area under the curve (AUC) of serial lactate levels using the 
trapezoidal rule, and normalized lactate load was defined as the lactate load 
divided by time. Receiver-operating characteristic curves were constructed to 
determine the performance of initial lactate, maximum lactate and normalized 
lactate load in predicting 28-day mortality.
RESULTS: A total of 1371 septic shock patients were included, and the 28-day 
mortality was 39.8%. Non-survivors had significantly higher initial lactate 
(means ± standard deviations: 3.9 ± 2.9 vs. 2.8 ± 1.7 mmol/L), maximum lactate 
(5.8 ± 3.8 vs. 4.3 ± 2.2 mmol/L), lactate load (94.3 ± 71.8 vs. 
61.1 ± 36.4 mmol·hr./L) and normalized lactate load (3.9 ± 3.0 vs. 
2.5 ± 1.5 mmol/L, all p <  0.001). The AUCs of initial lactate, maximum lactate 
and normalized lactate load were 0.623 (95% confidence interval: 0.596-0.648, 
with a cut-off value of 4.4 mmol/L), 0.606 (0.580-0.632, with a cut-off value of 
2.6 mmol/L) and 0.681 (0.656-0.706, with a cut-off value of 2.6 mmol/L), 
respectively. The AUC of normalized lactate load was significantly greater than 
both initial lactate and maximum lactate (all p <  0.001). In the multivariate 
logistic regression model, normalized lactate load was identified as an 
independent risk factor for 28-day mortality.
CONCLUSIONS: Normalized lactate load is an independent risk factor for 28-day 
mortality in adult septic shock patients. Normalized lactate load had better 
accuracy than both initial and maximum lactate in determining the prognosis of 
septic shock patients.

BACKGROUND: The predictive value of red blood cell distribution width (RDW) for 
mortality in patients with sepsis-induced acute kidney injury (SI-AKI) remains 
unclear. The present study aimed to investigate the potential association 
between RDW at admission and outcomes in patients with SI-AKI.
METHODS: The Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care (MIMIC)-IV (version 
2.0) database, released in June of 2022, provides medical data of SI-AKI 
patients to conduct our related research. Based on propensity score matching 
(PSM) method, the main risk factors associated with mortality in SI-AKI were 
evaluated using Cox proportional hazards regression analysis to construct a 
predictive nomogram. The concordance index (C-index) and decision curve analysis 
were used to validate the predictive ability and clinical utility of this model. 
Patients with SI-AKI were classified into the high- and low-RDW groups according 
to the best cut-off value obtained by calculating the maximum value of the 
Youden index.
RESULTS: A total of 7574 patients with SI-AKI were identified according to the 
filter criteria. Compared with the low-RDW group, the high-RDW group had higher 
28-day (9.49% vs. 31.40%, respectively, P <0.001) and 7-day (3.96% vs. 13.93%, 
respectively, P <0.001) mortality rates. Patients in the high-RDW group were 
more prone to AKI progression than those in the low-RDW group (20.80% vs. 
13.60%, respectively, P <0.001). Based on matched patients, we developed a 
nomogram model that included age, white blood cells, RDW, combined hypertension 
and presence of a malignant tumor, treatment with vasopressor, dialysis, and 
invasive ventilation, sequential organ failure assessment, and AKI stages. The 
C-index for predicting the probability of 28-day survival was 0.799. Decision 
curve analysis revealed that the model with RDW offered greater net benefit than 
that without RDW.
CONCLUSION: The present findings demonstrated the importance of RDW, which 
improved the predictive ability of the nomogram model for the probability of 
survival in patients with SI-AKI.

This study evaluated the association and prognostic significance of the systemic 
inflammation response index (SIRI) with mortality in sepsis. In this cohort 
study, the sepsis patients were retrieved from the Medical Information Mart for 
Intensive Care III (MIMIC-III) and MIMIC-IV intensive care unit (ICU) databases. 
SIRI was calculated by using the neutrophil, monocyte, and lymphocyte counts. 
The outcomes were 28-day mortality, 1-year mortality, and 28 days to 1-year 
mortality. The Cox proportional hazards model with a hazard ratio (HR) and a 95% 
confidence interval (CI) was used to investigate the association and prognostic 
value of SIRI with mortality in sepsis. Subgroup analyses of the associations of 
SIRI with 28-day and 1-year mortality in sepsis were based on age, gender, 
Simplified Acute Physiology Score II (SAPSII), Sequential Organ Failure 
Assessment (SOFA), and presence or absence of septic shock. The receiver 
operating characteristic (ROC) curve was used to compare the predictive 
performances of SIRI, SOFA and SAPS II for mortality in sepsis. Of the 4239 
patients included, 1339 patients suffered from 28-day mortality, 2085 patients 
suffering from 1-year mortality, and 746 (25.72%) suffered from 28 days to 
1-year mortality. High SIRI levels exhibited higher risks of 28-day mortality 
(HR: 1.15, 95% CI: 1.03-1.29, P = .010), 1-year mortality (HR: 1.14, 95% CI: 
1.04-1.24, P = .003), and 28 days to 1-year mortality (HR: 1.16, 95% CI: 
1.01-1.35, P = .047) in sepsis. A higher SIRI was reported related to 28-day 
mortality and 1-year mortality in sepsis patients with female gender, with SOFA 
< 8, with SAPS II < 44, and in sepsis patients without sepsis shock. The AUC of 
SIRS, SOFA, and SAPS II in predicting 28-day mortality in sepsis were 0.726, 
0.591, and 0.644, respectively. The AUC of SIRI in predicting 1-year mortality 
in sepsis was 0.761, higher than the AUC values of SOFA and SAPS II. A higher 
AUC value of SIRI compared with SOFA, and SAPS II in predicting 28 days to 
1-year mortality was observed. Elevated SIRI was associated with an increased 
risk of mortality in sepsis. SIRI is an independent prognostic biomarker of 
mortality in sepsis.

BACKGROUND: Some patients with psychotropic drug poisoning need intensive care 
unit (ICU) admission, but risk prediction models for prolonged ICU stays are 
lacking.
OBJECTIVES: Develop and evaluate a prediction model for prolonged ICU stays in 
patients with psychotropic drug poisoning.
METHODS: The clinical data of patients with psychotropic drug poisoning were 
collected from the Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care (MIMIC)-Ⅳ 2.2 
database. Patients were grouped by their ICU length of stay: non-prolonged (<2 
days) and prolonged (≥2 days). Variable selection methods included LASSO and 
logistic regression. The selected variables were used to construct the model, 
which was subsequently evaluated for discrimination, calibration, and clinical 
utility.
RESULTS: The cohort included 413 patients with psychotropic drug poisoning, 49.4 
% male, with a median age of 41 years. The variables stepwise selected for model 
construction through LASSO and logistic regression include sepsis, SAPS Ⅱ, heart 
rate, respiratory rate, and mechanical ventilation. The model showed good 
discrimination with an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve 
(AUC) of 0.785 (95 % CI: 0.736-0.833) and was validated well with bootstrap 
internal validation (AUC: 0.792, 95 % CI: 0.745-0.839). Calibration curves 
indicated good fit (χ2 = 4.148, P = 0.844), aligning observed and predicted 
rates of prolonged ICU stays. Decision curve analysis (DCA) showed positive net 
benefits across a threshold probability range of 0.07-0.85.
CONCLUSIONS: The model developed in this study may help predict the risk of 
prolonged ICU stays for patients with psychotropic drug poisoning.

Atrial Fibrillation Detection During Sepsis: Study on MIMIC III ICU Data.

Bashar SK, Hossain MB, Ding E, Walkey AJ, McManus DD, Chon KH.

Sepsis is defined by life-threatening organ dysfunction during infection and is 
one of the leading causes of critical illness. During sepsis, there is high risk 
that new-onset of atrial fibrillation (AF) can occur, which is associated with 
significant morbidity and mortality. As a result, computer aided automated and 
reliable detection of new-onset AF during sepsis is crucial, especially for the 
critically ill patients in the intensive care unit (ICU). In this paper, a novel 
automated and robust two-step algorithm to detect AF from ICU patients using 
electrocardiogram (ECG) signals is presented. First, several statistical 
parameters including root mean square of successive differences, Shannon 
entropy, and sample entropy were calculated from the heart rate for the 
screening of possible AF segments. Next, Poincaré plot-based features along with 
P-wave characteristics were used to reduce false positive detection of AF, 
caused by the premature atrial and ventricular beats. A subset of the Medical 
Information Mart for Intensive Care (MIMIC) III database containing 198 subjects 
was used in this study. During the training and validation phases, both the 
simple thresholding as well as machine learning classifiers achieved very high 
segment-wise AF classification performance. Finally, we tested the performance 
of our proposed algorithm using two independent test data sets and compared the 
performance with two state-of-the-art methods. The algorithm achieved an overall 
100% sensitivity, 98% specificity, 98.99% accuracy, 98% positive predictive 
value, and 100% negative predictive value on the subject-wise AF detection, thus 
showing the efficacy of our proposed algorithm in critically ill sepsis 
patients. The annotations of the data have been made publicly available for 
other investigators.

Background: Sepsis-induced coagulopathy (SIC) is a common cause for inducing 
poor prognosis of critically ill patients in intensive care unit (ICU). However, 
currently there are no tools specifically designed for assessing short-term 
mortality in SIC patients. This study aimed to develop a practical nomogram to 
predict the risk of 28-day mortality in SIC patients. Methods: In this 
retrospective cohort study, we extracted patients from the Medical Information 
Mart for Intensive Care III (MIMIC-III) database. Sepsis was defined based on 
Sepsis 3.0 criteria and SIC based on Toshiaki Iba's criteria. Kaplan-Meier 
curves were plotted to compare the short survival time between SIC and non-SIC 
patients. Afterward, only SIC cohort was randomly divided into training or 
validation set. We employed univariate logistic regression and stepwise 
multivariate analysis to select predictive features. The proposed nomogram was 
developed based on multivariate logistic regression model, and the 
discrimination and calibration were verified by internal validation. We then 
compared model discrimination with other traditional severity scores and machine 
learning models. Results: 9432 sepsis patients in MIMIC III were enrolled, in 
which 3280 (34.8%) patients were diagnosed as SIC during the first ICU 
admission. SIC was independently associated with the 7- and 28-day mortality of 
ICU patients. K-M curve indicated a significant difference in 7-day (Log-Rank: P 
< 0.001 and P = 0.017) and 28-day survival (Log-Rank: P < 0.001 and P < 0.001) 
between SIC and non-SIC groups whether the propensity score match (PSM) was 
balanced or not. For nomogram development, a total of thirteen variables of 
3,280 SIC patients were enrolled. When predicted the risk of 28-day mortality, 
the nomogram performed a good discrimination in training and validation sets 
(AUROC: 0.78 and 0.81). The AUROC values were 0.80, 0.81, 0.71, 0.70, 0.74, and 
0.60 for random forest, support vector machine, sequential organ failure 
assessment (SOFA) score, logistic organ dysfunction score (LODS), simplified 
acute physiology II score (SAPS II) and SIC score, respectively, in validation 
set. And the nomogram calibration slope was 0.91, the Brier value was 0.15. As 
presented by the decision curve analyses, the nomogram always obtained more net 
benefit when compared with other severity scores. Conclusions: SIC is 
independently related to the short-term mortality of ICU patients. The nomogram 
achieved an optimal prediction of 28-day mortality in SIC patient, which can 
lead to a better prognostics assessment. However, the discriminative ability of 
the nomogram requires validation in external cohorts to further improve 
generalizability.

BACKGROUND: Sepsis presents a significant healthcare challenge, characterized by 
high morbidity and mortality rates. There is a scarcity of relevant studies 
investigating the association between serum lactate dehydrogenase level and the 
prognosis of sepsis in patients from intensive care unit, with smaller sample 
sizes compared to other studies.
METHODS: A retrospective analysis was conducted utilizing data from the Second 
Affiliated Hospital of Guangzhou Medical University and the Medical Information 
Mart for Intensive Care IV (MIMIC-IV). The primary outcome was the in-hospital 
mortality. Multivariate Cox proportional hazards regression was adopted to 
assess the independent association. Receiver operator characteristic (ROC) curve 
was used to evaluate the predictive value.
RESULTS: We included a total of 2148 patients in the Guangzhou Sepsis Cohort 
(GZSC) database and 5830 patients in the MIMIC-IV database. In multivariate Cox 
proportional hazards regression, high levels of LDH are significantly associated 
with higher mortality (HR = 1.21, 95% CI 1.13-1.30, p < 0.001 in the GZSC 
database and HR = 1.19, 95% CI 1.13-1.25, p < 0.001 in the MIMIC-IV database). 
The ROC curves showed that the AUC of LDH was 0.663 in the GZSC database and 
0.660 in the MIMIC-IV database.
CONCLUSIONS: A lower lactate dehydrogenase level is associated with reduced 
in-hospital mortality among patients with sepsis, suggesting its potential as a 
valuable marker for predicting prognosis in this patient population.

OBJECTIVE: The study aimed to determine the prevalence and pathogens of invasive 
fungal infection (IFI) among intensive care unit (ICU) patients. The next goal 
was to investigate the association between empirical antifungal treatment and 
mortality in ICU patients.
METHODS: Using microbiological events, we identified all ICU patients with IFI 
and then retrieved electronic clinical data from the Medical Information Mart 
for Intensive Care IV (MIMIC-IV) database. The data were statistically analyzed 
using t-tests, chi-square tests, log-rank tests, and Cox regression.
RESULTS: The most commonly reported fungi were Candida (72.64%) and Aspergillus 
(19.08%). The most frequently prescribed antifungal medication was fluconazole 
(37.57%), followed by micafungin (26.47%). In the survival study of ICU patients 
and patients with sepsis, survivors were more likely to receive empirical 
antifungal treatment. In contrast, non-empirical antifungal therapy was 
significantly associated with poor survival in patients with positive blood 
cultures. We found that the current predictive score makes an accurate 
prediction of patients with fungal infections challenging.
CONCLUSIONS: Our study demonstrated that empirical antifungal treatment is 
associated with decreased mortality in ICU patients. To avoid treatment delays, 
novel diagnostic techniques should be implemented in the clinic. Until such 
tests are available, appropriate empirical antifungal therapy could be 
administered based on a model that predicts the optimal time to initiate 
antifungal therapy. Additional studies should be conducted to establish more 
accurate predictive models in the future.

IMPORTANCE: While corticosteroid administration in septic shock has been shown 
to result in faster shock reversal and lower short-term mortality, the role of 
corticosteroids in the management of cardiogenic shock (CS) remains unexplored.
OBJECTIVES: Determine the impact of corticosteroid administration on 90-day 
mortality (primary outcome) in patients admitted to a critical care unit with 
CS.
DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: In this retrospective cohort study, we used 
the critical care database of Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care-IV, 
and included all adult patients diagnosed with CS excluding repeated admissions, 
patients with adrenal insufficiency, those receiving baseline corticosteroids, 
and those requiring extracorporeal life support. We considered exposure based on 
receiving systemic corticosteroids from 6 hours before to 24 hours post-critical 
care admission.
MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: We calculated Cox proportional hazards using 
multivariate analysis for 90-day mortality (primary outcome). We also explored 
the association of corticosteroid use with hospital length of stay, 
ventilator-free days (VFDs), vasopressor-free days, ventilator-associated 
pneumonia, central-line-associated bloodstream infections, and hyperglycemia.
RESULTS: We included 2000 eligible patients, with 143 (7.2%) receiving systemic 
corticosteroids. Corticosteroid-treated patients were younger (67.7 vs. 71.2 yr; 
p = 0.006), had higher Sequential Organ Failure Assessment scores at baseline 
(9.4 vs. 7.8; p < 0.001), and more often required vasopressors (78% vs. 63%; p < 
0.001), and invasive mechanical ventilation (73% vs. 45%; p < 0.001). 
Corticosteroid use was associated with increased 90-day mortality in 
multivariate analysis (hazard ratio, 1.60; 95% CI, 1.25-2.05) and fewer VFDs 
(2.8 d fewer; 95% CI, 0.35-5.26) with no effect on other secondary outcomes.
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: Use of corticosteroids may be associated with 
increased mortality and a reduction in VFDs in patients admitted to critical 
care with CS. These findings suggesting potential harm of corticosteroids in CS 
might reflect unmeasured confounding and require corroboration through 
additional observational studies and ultimately randomized clinical trials.

BACKGROUND: To assess whether acute kidney injury (AKI) is independently 
associated with hospital mortality in ICU patients with sepsis, and estimate the 
excess AKI-related mortality attributable to AKI.
METHODS: We analyzed adult patients from two distinct retrospective critically 
ill cohorts: (1) Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care IV (MIMIC IV; n = 
15,610) cohort and (2) Wenzhou (n = 1,341) cohort. AKI was defined by Kidney 
Disease: Improving Global Outcomes (KDIGO) criteria. We applied multivariate 
logistic and linear regression models to assess the hospital and ICU mortality, 
hospital length-of-stay (LOS), and ICU LOS. The excess attributable mortality 
for AKI in ICU patients with sepsis was further evaluated.
RESULTS: AKI occurred in 5,225 subjects in the MIMIC IV cohort (33.5%) and 494 
in the Wenzhou cohort (36.8%). Each stage of AKI was an independent risk factor 
for hospital mortality in multivariate logistic regression after adjusting for 
baseline illness severity. The excess attributable mortality for AKI was 58.6% 
(95% CI [46.8%-70.3%]) in MIMIC IV and 44.6% (95% CI [12.7%-76.4%]) in Wenzhou. 
Additionally, AKI was independently associated with increased ICU mortality, 
hospital LOS, and ICU LOS.
CONCLUSION: Acute kidney injury is an independent risk factor for hospital and 
ICU mortality, as well as hospital and ICU LOS in critically ill patients with 
sepsis. Thus, AKI is associated with excess attributable mortality.

BACKGROUND: Patients with bloodstream infection of Klebsiella pneumoniae 
(BSI-KP) have a high risk of death and septic shock. This study aims to identify 
the risk factors for mortality and severity in patients of BSI-KP.
METHODS: Data of BSI-KP patients were extracted from the MIMIC IV (Medical 
Information Mart for Intensive Care IV) database, and patients infected with 
only K. pneumoniae in blood were included in this study. The risk factors of 
28-day mortality and septic shock in BSI-KP patients were analyzed, 
respectively.
RESULTS: A total of 279 patients enrolled and the all-cause 28-day mortality 
rate was 11.8%. The use of statins (OR 0.220, 95% CI 0.060-0.801, p = 0.022) and 
quinolones (OR 0.356, 95% CI 0.143-0.887, p = 0.027) were both independent 
protective factors for death within 28 days, while the use of vasoactive drugs 
(OR 7.377, 95% CI 1.775-30.651, p = 0.006) was a risk factor. Besides, pulmonary 
disease (OR 2.348, 95% CI 1.126-4.897, p = 0.023), bleeding and coagulation 
disorders (OR 3.626, 95% CI 1.783-7.372, p < 0.001), respiratory failure (OR 
2.823, 95% CI 0.178-6.767, p = 0.020) and kidney dysfunction (OR 2.450, 95% CI 
1.189-5.047, p = 0.015) were independent risk factors for patients suffered from 
septic shock while hypertension was a protective one. The receiver operating 
characteristic (ROC) curves could well predict the risk of death within 28-day 
(area under ROC = 0.855, 95% CI = 0.796-0.914, p < 0.001) and septic shock 
(AUROC = 0.815, 95% CI = 0.755-0.874, p < 0.001) in patients with BSI-KP.
CONCLUSION: The use of statins could decrease the risk of 28-day mortality in 
patients of BSI-KP. The risk factor-based prediction model provided evidence for 
drug treatment in BSI-KP patients. Paying more attention to the strategy of drug 
treatment will be an optimal way to improve patient's outcome in clinical 
practice.

OBJECTIVES: This study aimed to develop a prediction model for the detection of 
early sepsis-associated acute kidney injury (SA-AKI), which is defined as AKI 
diagnosed within 48 hours of a sepsis diagnosis.
DESIGN: A retrospective study design was employed. It is not linked to a 
clinical trial. Data for patients with sepsis included in the development cohort 
were extracted from the Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care IV 
(MIMIC-IV) database. The least absolute shrinkage and selection operator 
regression method was used to screen the risk factors, and the final screened 
risk factors were constructed into four machine learning models to determine an 
optimal model. External validation was performed using another single-centre 
intensive care unit (ICU) database.
SETTING: Data for the development cohort were obtained from the MIMIC-IV 2.0 
database, which is a large publicly available database that contains information 
on patients admitted to the ICUs of Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center in 
Boston, Massachusetts, USA, from 2008 to 2019. The external validation cohort 
was generated from a single-centre ICU database from China.
PARTICIPANTS: A total of 7179 critically ill patients with sepsis were included 
in the development cohort and 269 patients with sepsis were included in the 
external validation cohort.
RESULTS: A total of 12 risk factors (age, weight, atrial fibrillation, chronic 
coronary syndrome, central venous pressure, urine output, temperature, lactate, 
pH, difference in alveolar-arterial oxygen pressure, prothrombin time and 
mechanical ventilation) were included in the final prediction model. The 
gradient boosting machine model showed the best performance, and the areas under 
the receiver operating characteristic curve of the model in the development 
cohort, internal validation cohort and external validation cohort were 0.794, 
0.725 and 0.707, respectively. Additionally, to aid interpretation and clinical 
application, SHapley Additive exPlanations techniques and a web version 
calculation were applied.
CONCLUSIONS: This web-based clinical prediction model represents a reliable tool 
for predicting early SA-AKI in critically ill patients with sepsis. The model 
was externally validated using another ICU cohort and exhibited good predictive 
ability. Additional validation is needed to support the utility and 
implementation of this model.

Several commonly used scoring systems (SOFA, SAPS II, LODS, and SIRS) are 
currently lacking large sample data to confirm the predictive value of 30-day 
mortality from sepsis, and their clinical net benefits of predicting mortality 
are still inconclusive. The baseline data, LODS score, SAPS II score, SIRS 
score, SOFA score, and 30-day prognosis of patients who met the diagnostic 
criteria of sepsis were retrieved from the Medical Information Mart for 
Intensive Care III (MIMIC-III) intensive care unit (ICU) database. Receiver 
operating characteristic (ROC) curves and comparisons between the areas under 
the ROC curves (AUC) were conducted. Decision curve analysis (DCA) was performed 
to determine the net benefits between the four scoring systems and 30-day 
mortality of sepsis. For all cases in the cohort study, the AUC of LODS, SAPS 
II, SIRS, SOFA were 0.733, 0.787, 0.597, and 0.688, respectively. The 
differences between the scoring systems were statistically significant (all 
P-values < 0.0001), and stratified analyses (the elderly and non-elderly) also 
showed the superiority of SAPS II among the four systems. According to the DCA, 
the net benefit ranges in descending order were SAPS II, LODS, SOFA, and SIRS. 
For stratified analyses of the elderly or non-elderly groups, the results also 
showed that SAPS II had the most net benefit. Among the four commonly used 
scoring systems, the SAPS II score has the highest predictive value for 30-day 
mortality from sepsis, which is better than LODS, SIRS, and SOFA. The results of 
the DCA curves show that using the SAPS II score to predict the 30-day mortality 
of intensive care patients with sepsis to guide clinical applications may obtain 
the highest net benefit.

BACKGROUND: Critically ill patients have a variety of unique risk factors for 
pressure injury. Identification of these risk factors is essential to prevent 
pressure injury in this population.
OBJECTIVE: To identify factors predicting the development of pressure injury in 
critical care patients using a large data set from the PhysioNet MIMIC-III 
(Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care) clinical database.
METHODS: Data for 1460 patients were extracted from the database. Variables that 
were significant in bivariate analyses were used in a final logistic regression 
model. A final set of significant variables from the logistic regression was 
used to develop a decision tree model.
RESULTS: In regression analysis, cardiovascular disease, peripheral vascular 
disease, pneumonia or influenza, cardiovascular surgery, hemodialysis, 
norepinephrine administration, hypotension, septic shock, moderate to severe 
malnutrition, sex, age, and Braden Scale score on admission to the intensive 
care unit were all predictive of pressure injury. Decision tree analysis 
revealed that patients who received norepinephrine, were older than 65 years, 
had a length of stay of 10 days or less, and had a Braden Scale score of 15 or 
less had a 63.6% risk of pressure injury.
CONCLUSION: Determining pressure injury risk in critically ill patients is 
complex and challenging. One common pathophysiological factor is impaired tissue 
oxygenation and perfusion, which may be nonmodifiable. Improved risk 
quantification is needed and may be realized in the near future by leveraging 
the clinical information available in the electronic medical record through the 
power of predictive analytics.

Diseases, Beijing, China.

INTRODUCTION: Acute respiratory failure (ARF) has a high mortality rate, and 
currently, there is no convenient risk predictor. The coagulation disorder score 
was proven to be a promising metric for predicting in-hospital mortality, but 
its role in ARF patients remains unknown.
METHODS: In this retrospective study, data were extracted from the Medical 
Information Mart for Intensive Care IV (MIMIC-IV) database. Patients diagnosed 
with ARF and hospitalized for more than 2 days at their first admission were 
included. The coagulation disorder score was defined based on the sepsis-induced 
coagulopathy score and was calculated by parameters, namely, additive platelet 
count (PLT), international normalized ratio (INR), and activated partial 
thromboplastin time (APTT), based on which the participants were divided into 
six groups.
RESULTS: Overall, 5,284 ARF patients were enrolled. The in-hospital mortality 
rate was 27.9%. High levels of additive platelet score, INR score, and APTT 
score were significantly associated with increased mortality in ARF patients (P 
< 0.001). Binary logistic regression analysis showed that a higher coagulation 
disorder score was significantly related to the increased risk of in-hospital 
mortality in ARF patients (Model 2: coagulation disorder score = 6 vs. 
coagulation disorder score = 0: OR, 95% CI: 7.09, 4.07-12.34, P < 0.001). The 
AUC of the coagulation disorder score was 0.611 (P < 0.001), which was smaller 
than that of sequential organ failure assessment (SOFA) (De-long test P = 0.014) 
and simplified acute physiology score II (SAPS II) (De-long test P < 0.001) but 
larger than that of additive platelet count (De-long test P < 0.001), INR 
(De-long test P < 0.001), and APTT (De-long test P < 0.001), respectively. In 
subgroup analysis, we found that in-hospital mortality was markedly elevated 
with an increased coagulation disorder score in ARF patients. No significant 
interactions were observed in most subgroups. Of note, patients who did not 
administrate oral anticoagulant had a higher risk of in-hospital mortality than 
those who administrated oral anticoagulant (P for interaction = 0.024).
CONCLUSION: This study found a significant positive association between 
coagulation disorder scores and in-hospital mortality. The coagulation disorder 
score was superior to the single indicators (additive platelet count, INR, or 
APTT) and inferior to SAPS II and SOFA for predicting in-hospital mortality in 
ARF patients.

BACKGROUND: Sepsis-associated encephalopathy (SAE) is a critical and common 
problem in elderly patients with sepsis, which is still short of efficient 
predictive tools. Therefore, this study aims to screen the risk factors and 
establish a useful predictive nomogram for SAE in elderly patients with sepsis 
in the intensive care unit (ICU).
PATIENTS AND METHODS: Elderly patients (age ≥ 65 years) with sepsis were 
selected from the Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care (MIMIC)-IV 
database. Data from demographics and laboratory examinations were collected on 
the first day of admission to the ICU. SAE was defined by two criteria in the 
presence of sepsis: ① a Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) score of < 15 or ② delirium. 
Differences in demographics and laboratory tests were calculated between SAE and 
non-SAE groups. Participants were randomly divided into a training set and a 
validation set without replacement at a ratio of 6:4. A predictive nomogram was 
constructed in the training set by logistic regression analysis and then 
validated. The predictive capability of the nomogram was demonstrated by 
receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis and calibration curve analysis.
RESULTS: A total of 22,361 patients were selected, of which 2,809 patients 
(12.7%) died in the hospital and 8,290 patients (37.1%) had SAE. In-hospital 
mortality in the SAE group was higher than that in the non-SAE group (18.8 vs. 
8.9%, p < 0.001). Based on the results of logistic regression analysis, a 
nomogram integrating age, Na+, Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (SOFA) score, 
heart rate, and body temperature were constructed. The area under the curve 
(AUC) of the nomogram was 80.2% in the training set and 80.9% in the validation 
set. Calibration curve analysis showed a good predictive capacity of the 
nomogram.
CONCLUSION: SAE is an independent risk of in-hospital mortality in elderly 
patients in the intensive care unit. The nomogram has an excellent predictive 
capability of SAE and helps in clinical practice.

BACKGROUND: Sepsis is marked by elevated histamine, which is a vasodilator that 
increases vascular permeability. Although human studies are lacking, murine 
models of sepsis have indicated potential protective effects of histamine 2 
receptor antagonist administration (H2RAs).
OBJECTIVE: To assess any association between H2RA use in sepsis-3 patients 
admitted to the ICU and mortality, mechanical ventilation, length of stay, and 
markers of renal, liver, and lung dysfunction.
DESIGN: Retrospective cohort study.
SETTING: Intensive care units of the Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center 
(BIDMC) accessed via the MIMIC-IV database spanning an 11-year period from 2008 
to 2019.
PATIENTS (OR PARTICIPANTS): A total of 30,591 patients met the inclusion 
criteria for sepsis-3 on admission (mean age 66.49, standard deviation 15.92).
MAIN MEASURES: We collected patient age, gender, ethnicity, comorbidities 
(contained within the Charlson comorbidity index), SOFA score, OASIS score, APS 
III score, SAPS II score, H2RA use, creatinine, BUN, ALT, AST, and P/F ratios. 
Primary outcomes were mortality, mechanical ventilation, and ICU length of stay.
KEY RESULTS: A total of 30,591 patients met inclusion criteria over the 11-year 
sample period. The 28-day in hospital mortality rate was significantly lower 
among patients who received an H2RA (12.6% vs 15.1%, p < 0.001) as compared to 
those who did not receive an H2RA. Patients receiving an H2RA had significantly 
lower adjusted odds of mortality (0.802, 95% CI 0.741-0.869, p < 0.001), but 
significantly higher adjusted odds of invasive mechanical ventilation (4.426, 
95% CI 4.132-4.741, p < 0.001) and significantly higher ICU LOS (3.2 days vs. 
2.4 days, p < 0.001) as compared to the non-H2RA group. H2RA use was also 
associated with decreased severity of acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) 
and lower serum creatinine.
CONCLUSION: Among patients hospitalized in the ICU for sepsis, the use of an 
H2RA was associated with significantly lower odds of mortality, decreased 
severity of ARDS, and a lower incidence of renal insufficiency.

BACKGROUND: In updated international guidelines, combined albumin resuscitation 
is recommended for septic shock patients who receive large volumes of 
crystalloids, but minimal data exist on albumin use and the optimal timing in 
those with cardiogenic shock (CS). The objective of this study was to evaluate 
the relationship between resuscitation with a combination of albumin within 24 h 
and 30-day mortality in CS patients.
METHODS: We screened patients with CS from the Medical Information Mart for 
Intensive Care IV (MIMIC-IV) database. Multivariable Cox proportional hazards 
models and propensity score matching (PSM) were employed to explore associations 
between combined albumin resuscitation within 24 h and 30-day mortality in CS. 
Models adjusted for CS considered potential confounders. E-value analysis 
suggested for unmeasured confounding.
RESULTS: We categorized 1,332 and 254 patients into crystalloid-only and early 
albumin combination groups, respectively. Patients who received the albumin 
combination had decreased 30-day and 60-day mortality (21.7 vs. 32.4% and 25.2 
vs. 34.2%, respectively, P < 0.001), and the results were robust after PSM (21.3 
vs. 44.7% and 24.9 vs. 47.0%, respectively, P < 0.001) and following E-value. 
Stratified analysis showed that only ≥ 60 years old patients benefited from 
administration early albumin. In the early albumin combination group, the hazard 
ratios (HRs) of different adjusted covariates remained significant (HRs of 
0.45-0.64, P < 0.05). Subgroup analysis showed that resuscitation with 
combination albumin was significantly associated with reduced 30-day mortality 
in patients with maximum sequential organ failure assessment score≥10, with 
acute myocardial infarction, without an Impella or intra-aortic balloon pump, 
and with or without furosemide and mechanical ventilation (HRs of 0.49, 0.58, 
0.65, 0.40, 0.65 and 0.48, respectively; P < 0.001).
CONCLUSION: This study found, compared with those given crystalloid-only, 
resuscitation with combination albumin within 24 h is associated with lower 
30-day mortality of CS patients aged≥60. The results should be conducted to 
further assess in randomized controlled trials.

BACKGROUND: The kidney is one of the most vulnerable organs in sepsis patients, 
which mainly manifests as sepsis-associated acute kidney injury (SA-AKI). The 
case fatality rate of SA-AKI is high, and thus, predicting the risk of 
SA-AKI-related death is hugely significant. Anion gap (AG) is an important 
indicator in critical illness patients. The present study aimed to analyze the 
predictive value of the AG for the short-term prognosis of SA-AKI patients.
METHODS: SA-AKI patient data from the Medical Information Mart for Intensive 
Care (MIMIC-IV) database were collected retrospectively. Hospitalized septic 
patients who meet the inclusion criteria were included in the final analysis. 
All laboratory test parameters only included the data generated within the first 
24 hours after the patient entered the intensive care unit (ICU) and the extreme 
value. Univariate and multivariate logistic regression analyses were performed 
to analyze the risk factors related to the death of SA-AKI patients within 28 
days during hospitalization in the ICU.
RESULTS: A total of 3,684 SA-AKI patients were included, including 3,305 
patients with low AG (<18 mmol/L) and 379 patients with high AG (≥18 mmol/L). 
Among these patients, 497 cases (13.5%) died during hospitalization, including 
376 cases (11.4%) in the low AG group and 121 cases (31.9%) in the high AG 
group. Multivariate logistic regression analysis showed that elevated AG 
increased the risk of death in SA-AKI patients within 28 days during 
hospitalization in the ICU (odds ratio =1.2, 95% confidence interval: 1.2-1.3). 
Further analysis showed that the risk of death of SA-AKI patients within 28 days 
during hospitalization in the ICU was increased when AG ≥14 mmol/L. The 
relationship between AG level and the risk of death of SA-AKI patients during 
hospitalization was S-shaped.
CONCLUSIONS: In clinical practice, AG levels can serve as a valuable predictor 
of the death risk of SA-AKI patients during hospitalization.

Sepsis, a syndrome with disturbed host response to severe infection, is a 
critical health problem worldwide. It is urged to develop and update novel 
therapeutic strategies for improving the outcome of sepsis. In this study, we 
demonstrated that different bacteria clustering in sepsis patients may generate 
differences of prognosis results. We extracted all the sepsis patients from 
Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care IV 2.0 (MIMIC-IV 2.0) critical care 
data set according to certain standards and clinical score, a total of 2,339 
patients were included in our study. Then we used multiple data analytics and 
machine learning methods to make all data deeply analyzed and elucidated. The 
results showed that the types of bacteria infected by patients with different 
ages, sex and race are different, the types of bacteria infected by patients 
with different SIRS values and GCS scores of the first day are different, and 
the severity of patients with different clusters is different, and most 
importantly, the survival rate of patients with different clusters also has this 
significant difference. We concluded prognostic assessment predicated by 
bacteria clustering might be a relatively potentially novel strategies and 
perspectives on prevention and management for sepsis in the future.

OBJECTIVE: Lack of reproducibility in medical studies is a barrier to the 
generation of a robust knowledge base to support clinical decision-making. In 
this paper we outline the Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care (MIMIC) 
Code Repository, a centralized code base for generating reproducible studies on 
an openly available critical care dataset.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: Code is provided to load the data into a relational 
structure, create extractions of the data, and reproduce entire analysis plans 
including research studies.
RESULTS: Concepts extracted include severity of illness scores, comorbid status, 
administrative definitions of sepsis, physiologic criteria for sepsis, organ 
failure scores, treatment administration, and more. Executable documents are 
used for tutorials and reproduce published studies end-to-end, providing a 
template for future researchers to replicate. The repository's issue tracker 
enables community discussion about the data and concepts, allowing users to 
collaboratively improve the resource.
DISCUSSION: The centralized repository provides a platform for users of the data 
to interact directly with the data generators, facilitating greater 
understanding of the data. It also provides a location for the community to 
collaborate on necessary concepts for research progress and share them with a 
larger audience. Consistent application of the same code for underlying concepts 
is a key step in ensuring that research studies on the MIMIC database are 
comparable and reproducible.
CONCLUSION: By providing open source code alongside the freely accessible 
MIMIC-III database, we enable end-to-end reproducible analysis of electronic 
health records.

BACKGROUND: Mortality and other clinical outcomes of culture-negative and 
culture-positive among patients with fungal sepsis have not been documented, and 
whether antifungal therapy prior to fungal culture reports is related to 
decreased mortality among patients remains largely controversial. This study 
aimed to determine the mortality and other clinical outcomes of patients with 
positive yeast cultures and further investigate the effects of initial empiric 
antifungal therapy.
METHODS: A retrospective study was conducted among septic patients using the 
Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care (MIMIC)-IV database. Patients with 
sepsis were divided into two groups based on first fungal culture status during 
intensive care unit (ICU) stay, and initial empirical antifungal therapy was 
prescribed based on physician's experience prior to fungal culture reports 
within 48 h. The primary outcome was in-hospital all-cause mortality. The 
secondary outcomes were 30-day all-cause mortality, 60-day all-cause mortality, 
length of ICU stay and length of hospital stay. Multivariate logistic 
regression, propensity score matching (PSM), subgroup analyses and survival 
curve analyses were performed.
RESULTS: This study included 18,496 sepsis patients, of whom 3,477 (18.8%) had 
positive yeast cultures. Patients with positive yeast cultures had higher 
in-hospital all-cause mortality, 60-day all-cause mortality, and longer lengths 
of ICU stay and hospital stay than those with negative yeast cultures after PSM 
(all p < 0.01). Multivariate logistic regression analysis revealed that positive 
yeast culture was a risk factor for in-hospital mortality in the extended model. 
Subgroup analyses showed that the results were robust among the respiratory 
infection, urinary tract infection, gram-positive bacterial infection and 
bacteria-free culture subgroups. Interestingly, empiric antifungal therapy was 
not associated with lower in-hospital mortality among patients with positive 
yeast cultures, mainly manifested in stratification analysis, which showed that 
antifungal treatment did not improve outcomes in the bloodstream infection (odds 
ratio, OR 2.12, 95% CI: 1.16-3.91, p = 0.015) or urinary tract infection groups 
(OR 3.24, 95% CI: 1.48-7.11, p = 0.003).
CONCLUSION: Culture positivity for yeast among sepsis patients was associated 
with worse clinical outcomes, and empiric antifungal therapy did not lower 
in-hospital all-cause mortality in the bloodstream infection or urinary tract 
infection groups in the ICU.

Objective: The aim of the study is to explore the impact of early serum 
phosphate levels on the prognosis of critically ill patients with sepsis. 
Methods: In this retrospective large cohort study, data of patients with sepsis 
were obtained from the Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care IV database. 
Patients were retrospectively divided into a control group and three study 
groups according to their daily serum phosphate levels within 2 days of 
intensive care unit (ICU) admission. A Cox regression model was used to evaluate 
the association between serum phosphate levels and 28-day morbidity. Results: 
This study included 9,691 patients diagnosed with sepsis. During the first 2 
days of ICU admission, patients with hyperphosphatemia in either of the 2 days 
had higher 28-day mortality, while patients in the hypophosphatemia group had 
lower 28-day mortality (first day, 32.9% vs. 16.3%; second day, 36.3% vs. 
14.7%). After adjusting for potential confounders, hyperphosphatemia was 
significantly associated with 28-day mortality; however, only hypophosphatemia 
on the second day was independently associated with reduced 28-day mortality. 
After stratification in the hypophosphatemia group, subgroup analysis showed 
that only the association between the mild hypophosphatemia group and 28-day 
mortality reached statistical significance (hazard ratio = 0.76, 95% CI = 
0.65-0.89, P = 0.001). Conclusions: Mild hypophosphatemia might improve the 
short-term prognosis of patients with sepsis, and hyperphosphatemia is an 
independent risk factor for the outcomes of septic patients. After ICU 
admission, the serum phosphate levels on the second day had a better independent 
correlation with 28-day mortality, which prompted us to reconsider the optimal 
timing of phosphate evaluation.

BACKGROUND: Serum lactate dehydrogenase to albumin ratio (LAR) is associated 
with poor outcomes in malignancy and pneumonia. However, there are few studies 
suggesting that LAR is associated with the occurrence of acute kidney injury 
(AKI) in patients with sepsis, which was investigated in this study.
METHODS: We conducted a retrospective cohort study based on the Medical 
Information Mart for Intensive Care (MIMIC)-IV database. The primary outcome was 
the occurrence of AKI within 2 days and 7 days. Multivariable logistic 
regression models were used to calculate odds ratios to validate the association 
between LAR and AKI, in-hospital mortality, RRT use, and recovery of renal 
function, respectively.
RESULTS: A total of 4010 participants were included in this study. The median 
age of the participants was 63.5 years and the median LAR was 10.5. After 
adjusting for confounding variables, patients in the highest LAR quartile had a 
higher risk of AKI than those in the lowest LAR quartile within 2 days and 
7 days, with odds ratios of 1.37 (95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.23-1.52) and 
1.95 (95% CI: 1.72-2.22), respectively. The adjusted odds of AKI within 2 and 
7 days were 1.16 (95% CI: 1.12-1.20) and 1.29 (95% CI: 1.24-1.35) for each 
1 unit increase in LAR(log2), respectively.
CONCLUSION: This study demonstrated that elevated LAR was associated with poor 
prognosis in patients with sepsis. The risk of AKI and in-hospital mortality 
increased, the need for RRT increased, and the chance of recovery of renal 
function decreased with the increase of LAR.

BACKGROUND: The use of vasopressors is vital in septic shock. However, the 
optimal timing of treatment remains unclear. Therefore, we aimed to explore the 
impact of early norepinephrine initiation on the survival of patients with 
septic shock.
METHODS: We selected 4253 patients from the Medical Information Mart for 
Intensive Care IV database between 2008 and 2019. The primary outcome was 28-day 
mortality. Propensity score matching (PSM) was applied to minimize between-group 
imbalances, and a restricted mean survival time was used to quantify the 
beneficial impact of early norepinephrine treatment on survival. Sensitivity 
analyses were conducted to test the robustness of the study results in multiple 
cohorts.
RESULTS: In the PSM cohort, 2862 patients were equally assigned to early 
(receiving norepinephrine within the first 3 h) and delayed (> 3 h) 
norepinephrine initiation groups. Patients in the early norepinephrine 
initiation group received significantly less fluid therapy (0 vs. 79 mL/kg), had 
lower 28-day mortality (30.0% vs. 37.8%), longer survival days (21.89 vs. 20.37 
days), shorter duration of intensive care unit (4.9 vs. 7.2 days) and hospital 
stays (12.4 vs. 13.6 days), shorter duration of supportive norepinephrine and 
invasive mechanical ventilation, lower incidence of organ failure progression 
(64.4% vs. 79.2%) within 24 h after shock onset, and higher mean arterial 
pressure within 6 and 24 h after shock onset than patients in the delayed 
norepinephrine initiation group (p < 0.05).
CONCLUSIONS: Norepinephrine initiation within the first 3 h, regardless of 
preload dependency, was associated with longer survival time and shorter 
duration of supportive norepinephrine and invasive mechanical ventilation and 
may delay or partially reverse rapid onset organ failure.

OBJECTIVE: Although sodium bicarbonate (SB) solution has been widely used in 
clinical practice, its effect on mortality when administered to a large 
population of patients with acidosis is not known. The study aimed to 
investigate the effectiveness of SB infusion in septic patients with metabolic 
acidosis.
METHODS: Septic patients with metabolic acidosis were identified from the 
Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care (MIMIC)-III database. Propensity 
score (PS) was used to account for the baseline differences in the probability 
to receive SB or not. The marginal structural Cox model (MSCM) was employed to 
adjust for both baseline and time-varying confounding factors.
MAIN RESULTS: A total of 1718 septic patients with metabolic acidosis were 
enrolled in the study, including 500 in the SB group and 1218 in the non-SB 
group. Both pH [7.16 (standard deviation (SD): 0.10) vs. 7.22 (SD: 0.07); 
p < 0.001] and bicarbonate concentration (BC) [11.84 (SD: 3.63) vs. 14.88 (SD: 
3.36) mmol/l; p < 0.001] were significantly lower in the SB than that in the 
non-SB group. While there was no significant mortality effect in the overall 
population [hazard ratio (HR): 1.04; 95% CI 0.86-1.26; p = 0.67], SB was 
observed to be beneficial in patients with acute kidney injury (AKI) stage 2 or 
3 and pH < 7.2 (HR 0.74; 95% CI 0.51-0.86; p = 0.021). Similar results were 
replicated with the MSCM.
CONCLUSION: Our study observed that SB infusion was not associated with improved 
outcome in septic patients with metabolic acidosis, but it was associated with 
improved survival in septic patients with AKI stage 2 or 3 and severe acidosis. 
The results need to be verified in randomized controlled trials.

Background: A previous study has linked an increase in platelet-to-lymphocyte 
ratio (PLR) to a poor prognosis; however, the relationship between early change 
in PLR and outcomes in sepsis patients is unclear. Methods : The Medical 
Information Mart for Intensive Care IV database was for this retrospective 
cohort analysis on patients meeting the Sepsis-3 criteria. All the patients meet 
the Sepsis-3 criteria. The platelet-to-lymphocyte ratio (PLR) was calculated by 
dividing the platelet count by the lymphocyte count. We collected all PLR 
measurements that were available within 3 days of admission for analysis of 
longitudinal changes over time. Multivariable logistic regression analysis was 
used to determine the relationship between the baseline PLR and in-hospital 
mortality. After correcting for possible confounders, the generalized additive 
mixed model was used to examine the trends in PLR over time among survivors and 
nonsurvivors. Results: Finally, 3,303 patients were enrolled, and both low and 
high PLR levels were significantly associated with higher in-hospital mortality 
in the multiple logistic regression analysis (tertile 1: odds ratio, 1.240; 95% 
confidence interval, 0.981-1.568 and tertile 3: odds ratio, 1.410; 95% 
confidence interval, 1.120-1.776, respectively). The generalized additive mixed 
model results revealed that the PLR of the nonsurvival group declined faster 
than that of the survival group within 3 days after intensive care unit 
admission. After controlling for confounders, the difference between the two 
groups steadily decreased and increased by an average of 37.38 daily. 
Conclusions : There was a U-shaped relationship between the baseline PLR and 
in-hospital mortality of sepsis patients, and there was a significant difference 
between the nonsurvival and survival groups in the change in PLR over time. The 
early decrease in PLR was related to an increase in in-hospital mortality.

OBJECTIVE: To explore the association between dynamic changes in red blood cell 
distribution width to platelet count ratio (RPR) during hospitalisation and 
short-term mortality in patients with sepsis.
DESIGN: A retrospective cohort study using propensity score matching.
SETTING: Intensive care units (ICUs) of Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center.
PARTICIPANTS: A total of 8731 adult patients with sepsis were included in the 
study. The patients were identified from the ICU of the Medical Information Mart 
for Intensive Care database. The observed group included patients who 
experienced an increase in RPR of more than 30% during the first week of ICU 
admission, whereas the control group included the rest.
MAIN OUTCOME AND MEASURE: Using propensity score matching, a matched control 
group was created. The primary outcome was 28-day mortality, and the length of 
hospital stay and in-hospital mortality were the secondary outcomes.
RESULTS: The difference was evident in 28-day mortality between the two groups 
(85.8% vs 74.5%, p<0.001, Kaplan-Meier analysis, and HR=1.896, 95% CI=1.659 to 
2.168, p<0.001, Cox regression). In the secondary outcomes, there was a 
significant difference in in-hospital mortality (p<0.001). In addition, the 
study discovered that the observed groups had a significantly longer hospital 
stay (p<0.001). Meanwhile, the results of subgroup analyses were consistent with 
those of the primary analyses.
CONCLUSIONS: In patients with sepsis, a significantly increased RPR is 
positively associated with the short-term death rate. Continuous RPR monitoring 
could be a valuable measure for predicting short-term mortality in patients with 
sepsis.

BACKGROUND: Bacterial bloodstream infection is responsible for the majority of 
cases of sepsis and septic shock. Early recognition of the causative pathogen is 
pivotal for administration of adequate empiric antibiotic therapy and for the 
survival of the patients. In this study, we developed a feasible machine 
learning (ML) model to predict gram-positive and gram-negative bacteremia based 
on routine laboratory parameters.
METHODS: Data for 2118 patients with bacteremia were obtained from the Medical 
Information Mart for Intensive Care dataset. Patients were randomly split into 
the training set and test set by stratified sampling, and 374 routine laboratory 
blood test variables were retrieved. Variables with missing values in more than 
40% of the patients were excluded. Pearson correlation test was employed to 
eliminate redundant features. Five ML algorithms were used to build the model 
based on the selected features. Additionally, 132 patients with bacteremia who 
were treated at Qilu Hospital of Shandong University were included in an 
independent test cohort to evaluate the model.
RESULTS: After feature selection, 32 variables remained. All the five ML 
algorithms performed well in terms of discriminating between gram-positive and 
gram-negative bacteremia, but the performance of convolutional neural network 
(CNN) and random forest (RF) were better than other three algorithms. Consider 
of the interpretability of models, RF was chosen for further test 
(ROC-AUC = 0.768; 95%CI = 0.715-0.798, with a sensitivity of 75.20% and a 
specificity of 63.79%). To expand the application of the model, a decision tree 
(DT) was built utilizing the major variables, and it achieved an AUC of 0.679 
(95%CI = 0.632-0.723), a sensitivity of 66%, and a specificity of 67.82% in the 
test cohort. When tested in the Qilu Hospital cohort, the ROC-AUC of the RF and 
DT models were 0.666 (95%CI = 0.579-0.746) and 0.615 (95%CI = 0.526-0.698), 
respectively. Finally, a software was developed to make the RF- and DT-based 
prediction models easily accessible.
CONCLUSION: The present ML-based models could effectively discriminate between 
gram-positive and gram-negative bacteremia based on routine laboratory blood 
test results. This simple model would be beneficial in terms of guiding timely 
antibiotic selection and administration in critically ill patients with 
bacteremia before their pathogen test results are available.

OBJECTIVE: Our study aimed to identify predictors as well as develop machine 
learning (ML) models to predict the risk of 30-day mortality in patients with 
sepsis-associated encephalopathy (SAE).
MATERIALS AND METHODS: ML models were developed and validated based on a public 
database named Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care (MIMIC)-IV. Models 
were compared by the area under the curve (AUC), accuracy, sensitivity, 
specificity, positive and negative predictive values, and Hosmer-Lemeshow good 
of fit test.
RESULTS: Of 6994 patients in MIMIC-IV included in the final cohort, a total of 
1232 (17.62%) patients died following SAE. Recursive feature elimination (RFE) 
selected 15 variables, including acute physiology score III (APSIII), Glasgow 
coma score (GCS), sepsis related organ failure assessment (SOFA), Charlson 
comorbidity index (CCI), red blood cell volume distribution width (RDW), blood 
urea nitrogen (BUN), age, respiratory rate, PaO2, temperature, lactate, 
creatinine (CRE), malignant cancer, metastatic solid tumor, and platelet (PLT). 
The validation cohort demonstrated all ML approaches had higher discriminative 
ability compared with the bagged trees (BT) model, although the difference was 
not statistically significant. Furthermore, in terms of the calibration 
performance, the artificial neural network (NNET), logistic regression (LR), and 
adapting boosting (Ada) models had a good calibration-namely, a high accuracy of 
prediction, with P-values of 0.831, 0.119, and 0.129, respectively.
CONCLUSIONS: The ML models, as demonstrated by our study, can be used to 
evaluate the prognosis of SAE patients in the intensive care unit (ICU). Online 
calculator could facilitate the sharing of predictive models.

BACKGROUND: Sepsis is a common and severe disease with a high mortality rate in 
intensive care unit (ICU). The hemoglobin (HGB) level is a key parameter for 
oxygen supply in sepsis. Although HGB is associated with the progression of 
inflammation in sepsis patients, its role as a marker following sepsis treatment 
remains unclear. Here, we studied the correlation between early temporal changes 
in HGB levels and long-term mortality rates in septic patients.
METHOD: In this retrospective study of data on patients with sepsis from the 
Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care (MIMIC) IV database, the outcome was 
long-term mortality. Patients were divided based on the cut-off of the HGB 
percentage for receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve calculation. 
Kaplan-Meier (KM) survival curves and Cox proportional hazards regression models 
were used to analyse the associations between groups and outcomes. Propensity 
score matching (PSM) was used to verify the results.
RESULTS: In this study, 2042 patients with sepsis and changes in HGB levels at 
day 4 after admission compared to day 1 were enrolled and divided into two 
groups: group 1 (n = 1147) for those with reduction of HGB < 7% and group 2 
(n = 895) for those with dropping ≥ 7%. The long-term survival chances of sepsis 
with less than a 7% reduction in the proportion of HGB at day four were 
significantly higher than those of patients in the group with a reduction of 7% 
or more. After adjusting for covariates in the Cox model, the hazard ratios 
(HRs) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) for long-term all-cause mortality in 
the group with a reduction of 7% or more were as follows: 180 days [HR = 1.41, 
95% CI (1.22 to 1.63), P < 0.001]; 360 days [HR = 1.37, 95% CI (1.21 to 1.56), 
P < 0.001]; 540 days [HR = 1.35, 95% CI (1.20 to 1.53), P < 0.001]; 720 days 
[HR = 1.45, 95% CI (1.29 to 1.64), P < 0.001]. Additionally, the long-term 
survival rates, using Kaplan-Meier analysis, for the group with a reduction of 
7% or more were lower compared to the group with less than 7% reduction at 
180 days (54.3% vs. 65.3%, P < 0.001), 360 days (42.3% vs. 50.9%, P < 0.001), 
540 days (40.2% vs. 48.6%, P < 0.001), and 720 days (35.5% vs. 46.1%, 
P < 0.001). The same trend was obtained after using PSM.
CONCLUSION: A ≥ 7% decrease in HGB levels on Day 4 after admission was 
associated with worse long-term prognosis in sepsis patients admitted to the 
ICU.

PURPOSE: Sepsis is a significant threat in the intensive care unit (ICU) 
worldwide because it has high morbidity and mortality rates. Early recognition 
and diagnosis of sepsis are essential for the prevention of adverse outcomes. 
The present study aimed to quantitatively assess the association between serum 
anion gap (AG) levels and 30- and 90-day all-cause mortality among sepsis 
patients.
METHODS: Clinical data of patients diagnosed with sepsis were extracted from the 
Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care III (MIMIC III) database. 
Kaplan-Meier curves and Cox proportional hazards models were used to evaluate 
the association between serum AG levels and all-cause mortality. A receiver 
operating characteristic (ROC) curve was drawn to quantify the efficacy of using 
the serum AG level to predict all-cause mortality.
RESULTS: A total of 3811 patients were included in the study. The Kaplan-Meier 
curves showed that patients with higher serum AG levels had a shorter survival 
time than those with lower levels. Serum AG levels were found to be highly 
effective in predicting all-cause mortality secondary to sepsis (30-day: 
AUROC = 0.703; 90-day: AUROC = 0.696). The Cox regression model further 
indicated that the serum AG level was an independent risk factor for 30- and 
90-day mortality in sepsis (HR 3.44, 95% CI 2.97-3.99 for 30-day; HR 3.17, 95% 
CI 2.76-3.65 for 90-day, P < 0.001 for both).
CONCLUSIONS: High serum AG may be considered as an alternative parameter for 
predicting the death risk in sepsis when other variables are not immediately 
available. Prospective large-scale studies are needed to support its predictive 
value in the clinic.

PURPOSE: To investigate the association between red cell distribution width 
(RDW) to albumin (ALB) ratio and acute kidney injury (AKI) in sepsis.
METHODS: This was a retrospective cohort study. Data were collected from the 
Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care Database IV (MIMIC-IV) from 2008 to 
2019. The incidence of AKI was the primary outcome, which was defined based on 
the improving Global Outcomes (KDIGO). The association of RDW/ALB ratio with AKI 
in sepsis was assessed by multivariate logistic regression analysis using 
relative risk (RR) and a 95% confidence interval (CI). Subgroup group analyses 
were applied according to age, use of ventilation, and use of vasopressor, SAPS 
II, and SOFA.
RESULTS: Of 1810 sepsis patients involved in this study, 563 (31.10%) sepsis 
patients developed AKI after ICU admission. The results suggested an increase in 
RDW/ALB was associated with a rise in the risk of AKI in sepsis (RR 1.09, 95% CI 
1.02 to 1.16, P = 0.013).Based on the subgroup analysis, RDW/ALB ratio was 
significantly associated with the risk of AKI in sepsis patients using the 
treatment of ventilation (RR: 1.07, 95% CI 1.01 to 1.14, P = 0.041)) and in 
patients with SAPS II < 43 (RR: 1.16, 95% CI 1.04 to 1.29, P = 0.007).
CONCLUSION: RDW/ALB ratio was independently associated with the risk of AKI in 
sepsis patients.

BACKGROUND: Acute kidney injury is common in patients with sepsis and 
contributes to poor prognosis and mortality. Early identification of high-risk 
patients can provide evidence for clinical decision-making.
METHODS: We developed a prediction model based on a cohort of 15,726 patients 
with sepsis from the Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care III critical 
care database. Logistic regression analysis was applied to develop a prediction 
model incorporating the selected risk factors. Discrimination and calibration of 
the prediction model were assessed using the C-index and calibration plot.
RESULTS: Risk factors in the prediction model included diabetes mellitus, 
chronic kidney disease, congestive heart failure, chronic liver disease, 
hyperbicarbonemia, hyperglycemia, low blood pH, prolonged clotting time, 
hypotension, and hyperlactatemia. The model showed great discrimination with a 
C-index of 0.711 (95% CI, 0.702-0.721) and appropriate calibration. A medium 
C-index value of 0.712 (95% CI, 0.697-0.727) could still be reached in the 
validation cohort. Negative and positive predictive values for the optimal 
cutoff value of ≥6 points were 56.8% and 72.3% in the training cohort and 57.3% 
and 72.6% in the validation cohort, respectively.
CONCLUSIONS: This prediction model allows clinicians to quickly assess the risk 
of sepsis-associated acute kidney injury (SA-AKI) at an early stage. 
Accordingly, clinicians can implement more medical measures that are considered 
beneficial to patients with sepsis.

Objective: Our study aims to evaluate the association between heart rate 
variability (HRV) and short- and long-term prognosis in patients admitted to 
intensive care unit (ICU). Methods and Results: Adult patients continuously 
monitored for over 24 h in ICUs from the the American Medical Information Mart 
for Intensive Care (MIMIC)-IV Waveform Database were recruited in our study. 
Twenty HRV-related variables (8 time domain, 6 frequency domain, and 6 nonlinear 
variables) were calculated based on RR intervals. The association between HRV 
and all-cause mortality was assessed. Ninety-three patients met the inclusion 
criteria and were classified into atrial fibrillation (AF) and sinus rhythm (SR) 
groups, which were further divided into 30-day survivor group and 
nonsurvivor\groups based on their survival status. The 30-day all-cause 
mortality rates in AF and SR groups were 36.3% and 14.6%, respectively. All the 
time domain, frequency domain, and nonlinear HRV parameters did not differ 
significantly between survivors and nonsurvivors with or without AF (all P > 
0.05). Presence of renal failure, malignancy, and elevated blood urea nitrogen 
level were associated with increased 30-day all-cause mortality in SR patients, 
while presence of sepsis, infection, higher platelet count, and magnesium level 
were associated with increased 30-day all-cause mortality in AF patients. 
Conclusions: Heart rate variability variables were not associated with increased 
30-day all-cause mortality in ICU patients with or without AF.

OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the impact of pre-intensive care unit admission (pre-ICU) 
statin use on all-cause in-hospital mortality and ICU length of stay (LOS).
DESIGN: Retrospective cohort study.
SETTING: Adult ICUs at tertiary hospitals.
PATIENTS: Adult critically ill patients diagnosed with sepsis admitted to the 
ICUs.
INTERVENTION: The exposure was pre-ICU statin prescription (statin users); 
unexposed represented absence of pre-ICU prescription (non-users).
MEASUREMENT AND MAIN RESULTS: We used the 2001-2012 Medical Information Mart for 
Intensive Care-III (MIMIC-III) database to determine average treatment effect 
(ATE) of pre-ICU statin use on 30-day ICU mortality, ICU LOS, and 30-day 
in-hospital mortality using the Augmented Inverse Propensity Weighted technique 
(AIPW), after adjusting for confounding factors (age, race, health insurance, 
corticosteroids use, vital signs, laboratory tests, and Sequential Organ Failure 
Assessment score (SOFA). We measured 30-day ICU mortality as deaths within 
30 days of admission to the ICU, and ICU LOS was measured in fractional days. A 
30-day in-hospital mortality was measured as death within 30 days of hospital 
admission. A total of 8200 patients with sepsis were identified; 19.8% (1623) 
were statin users, and 80.2% (6577) were non-users. Most were Caucasian, aged 
80 years and above, and male. After adjusting for confounding factors, pre-ICU 
statin use decreased 30-day ICU mortality (ATE, -0.026; 95% confidence interval 
[CI], -0.048 to -0.009); ICU LOS (ATE, -0.369; 95% Cl, -0.849 to -0.096); and 
30-day in-hospital mortality (ATE, -0.039; 95% CI, -0.084 to -0.026) on average 
compared with non-statin use, respectively. In a stratified analysis, the result 
for ICU LOS (ATE, -0.526; 95% CI, -0.879 to -0.241) and 30-day in-hospital 
mortality (ATE, -0.023; 95% CI, -0.048 to -0.002) was consistent among patients 
admitted to the medical ICU.
CONCLUSIONS: Among patients with sepsis admitted to the medical ICU, pre-ICU 
statin use is causally associated with a decrease in 30-day ICU mortality, ICU 
LOS, and 30-day in-hospital mortality compared to non-use. This study adds to 
the totality of evidence on the pleiotropic effect of statin use in patients 
with sepsis.

University, Chongqing, China.

BACKGROUND: Subarachnoid hemorrhage has a high rate of disability and mortality, 
and the ability to use existing disease severity scores to estimate the risk of 
adverse outcomes is limited. Collect relevant information of patients during 
hospitalization to develop more accurate risk prediction models, using logistic 
regression (LR) and machine learning (ML) technologies, combined with 
biochemical information.
METHODS: Patient-level data were extracted from MIMIC-IV data. The primary 
outcome was in-hospital mortality. The models were trained and tested on a data 
set (ratio 70:30) including age and key past medical history. The recursive 
feature elimination (RFE) algorithm was used to screen the characteristic 
variables; then, the ML algorithm was used to analyze and establish the 
prediction model, and the validation set was used to further verify the 
effectiveness of the model.
RESULT: Of the 1,787 patients included in the mimic database, a total of 379 
died during hospitalization. Recursive feature abstraction (RFE) selected 20 
variables. After simplification, we determined 10 features, including the 
Glasgow coma score (GCS), glucose, sodium, chloride, SPO2, bicarbonate, 
temperature, white blood cell (WBC), heparin use, and sepsis-related organ 
failure assessment (SOFA) score. The validation set and Delong test showed that 
the simplified RF model has a high AUC of 0.949, which is not significantly 
different from the best model. Furthermore, in the DCA curve, the simplified GBM 
model has relatively higher net benefits. In the subgroup analysis of 
non-traumatic subarachnoid hemorrhage, the simplified GBM model has a high AUC 
of 0.955 and relatively higher net benefits.
CONCLUSIONS: ML approaches significantly enhance predictive discrimination for 
mortality following subarachnoid hemorrhage compared to existing illness 
severity scores and LR. The discriminative ability of these ML models requires 
validation in external cohorts to establish generalizability.

Sepsis, septic shock, and cardiogenic shock are life-threatening conditions 
associated with high mortality rates, but differentiating them is complex 
because they share certain symptoms. Using the Medical Information Mart for 
Intensive Care (MIMIC)-III database and artificial intelligence (AI), we aimed 
to increase diagnostic precision, focusing on Bayesian network classifiers 
(BNCs) and comparing them with other AI methods. Data from 5970 adults, 
including 950 patients with cardiogenic shock, 1946 patients with septic shock, 
and 3074 patients with sepsis, were extracted for this study. Of the original 51 
variables included in the data records, 12 were selected for constructing the 
predictive model. The data were divided into training and validation sets at an 
80:20 ratio, and the performance of the BNCs was evaluated and compared with 
that of other AI models, such as the one rule classifier (OneR), classification 
and regression tree (CART), and an artificial neural network (ANN), in terms of 
accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, precision, and F1-score. The BNCs exhibited 
an accuracy of 87.6% to 91.5%. The CART model demonstrated a notable 91.6% 
accuracy when only three decision levels were used, whereas the intricate ANN 
model reached 90.5% accuracy. Both the BNCs and the CART model allowed clear 
interpretation of the predictions. BNCs have the potential to be valuable tools 
in diagnostic tasks, with an accuracy, sensitivity, and precision comparable, in 
some cases, to those of ANNs while demonstrating superior interpretability.

OBJECTIVES: Given the high incidence and mortality rate of sepsis, early 
identification of high-risk patients and timely intervention are crucial. 
However, existing mortality risk prediction models still have shortcomings in 
terms of operation, applicability, and evaluation on long-term prognosis. This 
study aims to investigate the risk factors for death in patients with sepsis, 
and to construct the prediction model of short-term and long-term mortality 
risk.
METHODS: Patients meeting sepsis 3.0 diagnostic criteria were selected from the 
Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care-IV (MIMIC-IV) database and randomly 
divided into a modeling group and a validation group at a ratio of 7꞉3. Baseline 
data of patients were analyzed. Univariate Cox regression analysis and full 
subset regression were used to determine the risk factors of death in patients 
with sepsis and to screen out the variables to construct the prediction model. 
The time-dependent area under the curve (AUC), calibration curve, and decision 
curve were used to evaluate the differentiation, calibration, and clinical 
practicability of the model.
RESULTS: A total of 14 240 patients with sepsis were included in our study. The 
28-day and 1-year mortality were 21.45% (3 054 cases) and 36.50% (5 198 cases), 
respectively. Advanced age, female, high sepsis-related organ failure assessment 
(SOFA) score, high simplified acute physiology score II (SAPS II), rapid heart 
rate, rapid respiratory rate, septic shock, congestive heart failure, chronic 
obstructive pulmonary disease, liver disease, kidney disease, diabetes, 
malignant tumor, high white blood cell count (WBC), long prothrombin time (PT), 
and high serum creatinine (SCr) levels were all risk factors for sepsis death 
(all P<0.05). Eight variables, including PT, respiratory rate, body temperature, 
malignant tumor, liver disease, septic shock, SAPS II, and age were used to 
construct the model. The AUCs for 28-day and 1-year survival were 0.717 (95% CI 
0.710 to 0.724) and 0.716 (95% CI 0.707 to 0.725), respectively. The calibration 
curve and decision curve showed that the model had good calibration degree and 
clinical application value.
CONCLUSIONS: The short-term and long-term mortality risk prediction models of 
patients with sepsis based on the MIMIC-IV database have good recognition 
ability and certain clinical reference significance for prognostic risk 
assessment and intervention treatment of patients.

BACKGROUND: Sepsis is a complex condition with high morbidity and mortality. 
Prompt treatment can improve survival, but for survivors the risk of 
deterioration and readmission remains high. Little is known about the 
association between discharge setting and readmission among sepsis survivors.
OBJECTIVE: To examine 30-day hospital readmission rates in adult sepsis 
survivors by the type of setting to which patients were discharged.
METHODS: The Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care database was used to 
identify adult sepsis survivors and evaluate 30-day readmission by discharge 
setting. A χ2 contingency analysis was used with each factor and 
presence/absence of readmission. The Kruskal-Wallis test was used to compare 
readmissions across discharge settings.
RESULTS: From our sample (N = 7107; mean age 66.5 years; 46.2% women), 23.6% (n 
= 1674) were readmitted within 30 days and of those readmitted, 30% were 
readmitted between 1 and 3 times. Discharge setting (P < .001) and age (P = .02) 
were significantly associated with readmission, but sex, ethnicity, and 
insurance type were not. High numbers of readmissions were seen in patients 
discharged to skilled nursing facilities (29.6%), home health care (26.9%), and 
home (15.0%). Similar high comorbidity burden and acuteness of illness were seen 
in patients discharged to these settings.
CONCLUSIONS: Sepsis survivors discharged to skilled nursing facilities, home 
health care, and home are at high risk for 30-day readmission. The rates of 
readmission from home health care and home settings were alarming. Often 
patients are discharged to inappropriate settings, placing them at risk for 
residual sepsis and readmission. Future research should focus on appropriate 
timing of hospital discharge and transition to the most appropriate discharge 
setting.

Background: Despite advancements in sepsis treatment, mortality remains high. 
Plasmapheresis (PE) targeting multiple pathways simultaneously seems to be a 
potential treatment option, but evidence is insufficient. We aimed to 
investigate the efficacy of PE for sepsis with multiple organ failure (MOF). 
Method: Septic patients with MOF were identified from the Medical Information 
Mart for Intensive Care IV database. Patients who received PE were matched with 
those receiving conventional therapy via propensity score matching. Regression 
analyses evaluated the association between PE and outcomes. The Kaplan-Meier 
(KM) method was used to analyze the survival probability. The generalized 
additive mixed model investigated early indexes changes' association with 
treatment modalities and 28-day mortality. Results: Nine hundred six septic 
patients with MOF were enrolled. After propensity score matching, PE and 
conventional groups consisted of 60 cases each. Plasmapheresis was associated 
with a reduced risk of 28-day mortality (hazard ratio [HR], 0.50; 95% confidence 
interval [CI], 0.27-0.94), 1-year mortality (HR, 0.44; 95% CI, 0.26-0.74), and 
in-hospital mortality (HR, 0.38; 95% CI, 0.20-0.71). The KM curves demonstrated 
significant differences in survival probability between groups. Compared with 
the conventional group, the sequential organ failure assessment, norepinephrine 
dosage, prothrombin time, actate dehydrogenase, total bilirubin, white blood 
cells, and immature granulocytes in the PE group significantly decreased over 
time, while platelets, red blood cells, and hemoglobin significantly increased 
over time. Conclusions: Plasmapheresis demonstrated an association with reduced 
risks of 28-day, in-hospital and 1-year mortality in septic patients with MOF. 
Moreover, plasmapheresis might exhibit the potential to improve outcomes by 
improving organ function, hemodynamics, and restoring several indicators, such 
as coagulation, anemia, and inflammation.

The purpose of this project was to characterize the longitudinal dynamic serum 
sodium trajectory of sepsis patients with lactic acidosis (LA) admitted to the 
intensive care unit (ICU), and to explore the association between these 
trajectories and the 30-day mortality rate of patients. Data on patients 
admitted to the ICU with a diagnosis of LA combined with sepsis from 2008-2019 
were collected from the Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care-IV 
(MIMIC-IV) database. Patients admitted to the ICU for > 24 hours and for the 
first time were sorted into 3 groups based on their serum sodium levels at 
admission. The Group-based Trajectory Modeling (GBTM) method was applied to 
analyze the trajectory changes of serum sodium in each group of patients over 72 
hours. Patients' survival differences between different trajectory groups were 
compared using Kaplan-Meier (K-M) survival curves. Subgroup analysis was carried 
out to determine the influencing factors of the relationship between dynamic 
changes in serum sodium and patient survival. This study included 514 patients 
with LA complicated by sepsis, who were clustered into three groups based on 
their admission serum sodium levels, with 378 patients in the normal blood 
sodium (135-145 mEq/L) group, 116 patients in the hyponatremia (< 135 mEq/L) 
group, and 20 patients in the hypernatremia (> 145 mEq/L) group. GBTM analysis 
generated three different serum sodium trajectories. The K-M curve results 
demonstrated that patients with relatively stable serum sodium levels within the 
normal range (Class 2) had lower 30-day mortality compared to groups with larger 
fluctuations in sodium levels (Class 1, Class 3). Subgroup analysis uncovered 
notable interactions (P < 0.05) between different trajectories of serum sodium 
and covariates such as race, marital status, Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS), 
Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (SOFA), renal replacement therapy (RRT), 
congestive heart failure, kidney disease, liver disease, and diabetes. Among 
patients with LA complicated by sepsis, those with stable and normal 
fluctuations in serum sodium levels had better 30-day survival rates. GBTM is a 
refined method to describe the evolution of serum sodium and its association 
with clinical outcomes, which may enhance the current understanding of blood 
sodium level regulation.

OBJECTIVE: Lung is often implicated in sepsis, resulting in acute respiratory 
distress syndrome (ARDS). The alveolar-arterial oxygen gradient [D(A-a)O2 ] 
reflects lung diffusing capacity, which is usually compromised in ARDS. But 
whether D(A-a)O2 impacts the prognosis of patients with sepsis remains to be 
explored. Our study aims to investigate the association between D(A-a)O2 and 
28-day mortality in patients with sepsis using a large sample, multicenter 
Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care (MIMIC)-IV database.
METHODS: We extracted a data of 35 010 patients with sepsis from the 
retrospective cohort MIMIC-IV database, by which the independent effects of 
D(A-a)O2 on 28-day death risk was investigated, with D(A-a)O2 as being the 
exposure variable and 28-day fatality being the outcome variable. Binary 
logistic regression and a two-piecewise linear model were employed to explore 
the relationship between D(A-a)O2 and the 28-day death risk after confounding 
factors were optimized including demographic indicators, Charlson comorbidity 
index (CCI), Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (SOFA) score, drug 
administration, and vital signs.
RESULTS: A total of 18 933 patients were finally included in our analysis. The 
patients' average age was 66.67 ± 16.01 years, and the mortality at 28 days was 
19.23% (3640/18933). Multivariate analysis demonstrated that each 10-mmHg rise 
of D(A-a)O2 was linked with a 3% increase in the probability of death at 28 days 
either in the unadjusted model or in adjustment for demographic variables (Odds 
ratio [OR]: 1.03, 95% CI: 1.02 to 1.03). But, each 10 mmHg increase in D(A-a)O2 
was associated with a 3% increase of death (OR: 1.03, 95% CI: 1.023 to 1.033) in 
the case of adjustment for all covariants. Through smoothed curve fitting and 
generalized summation models, we found that non-linear relationship existed 
between D(A-a)O2 and the death at 28-day, which demonstrated that D(A-a)O2 had 
no any impacts on the prognosis of patients with sepsis when D(A-a)O2 was less 
than or equal to 300 mmHg, but once D(A-a)O2 exceeded 300 mmHg, however, every 
10 mmHg elevation of D(A-a)O2 is accompanied by a 5% increase of the 28-day 
death (OR: 1.05; 95% CI:1.04 to 1.05, p < 0.0001).
CONCLUSION: Our findings suggests that D(A-a)O2 is a valuable indicator for the 
management of sepsis patient, and it is recommended that D(A-a)O2 be maintained 
less than 300 mmHg as far as possible during sepsis process.

Background: The relationship between urine output (UO) and in-hospital mortality 
in intensive care patients with septic shock is currently inconclusive. Methods: 
The baseline data, UO, and in-hospital prognosis of intensive care patients with 
septic shock were retrieved from the Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care 
IV (MIMIC-IV) database. By drawing receiver operating characteristic (ROC) 
curves and comparing the areas under the ROC curves (AUC) to determine the 
predictive value of UO for in-hospital mortality, and by drawing the 
Kaplan-Meier curves to compare the difference in in-hospital mortality between 
different groups of UO. Results: Before and after the propensity score matching 
(PSM) analysis, UO was always a risk factor for in-hospital mortality in 
patients with septic shock. The AUC of UO was comparable to the Sequential Organ 
Failure Assessment (SOFA) scoring system, while the AUC of combining UO and SOFA 
was greater than that of SOFA. The median survival time of the high-UO group (UO 
> 0.39 ml/kg/h, before PSM; UO > 0.38 ml/kg/h, after PSM) was longer than that 
of the low-UO group. Compared with the high-UO group, the hazard ratios (HR) of 
the low-UO group were 2.6857 (before PSM) and 1.7879 (after PSM). Conclusions: 
UO is an independent risk factor for septic shock. Low levels of UO 
significantly increase the in-hospital mortality of intensive care patients with 
septic shock. The predictive value of UO is comparable to the SOFA scoring 
system, and the combined predictive value of the two surpasses SOFA alone.

BACKGROUND: Sepsis-induced myocardial injury (SIMI) is a critical complication 
of sepsis, marked by high mortality rates, and lacks effective treatments. The 
impact of statin therapy on mortality in SIMI patients remains unclear. This 
study aims to explore the association between statin use and mortality in SIMI 
patients, focusing on both short-term and long-term outcomes.
METHODS: A retrospective cohort study was conducted by extracting SIMI patient 
information from the Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care IV (MIMIC-IV) 
database. Patients were categorized into statin and non-statin groups. A 1:1 
nearest propensity-score matching (PSM) was used to balance baseline 
characteristics. Survival outcomes were assessed using Kaplan-Meier analysis and 
robust Cox proportional hazards models to understand the effects of statin use, 
type and dosage on mortality at 28 days, 90 days, and 1 year. E-Value analysis 
was used for unmeasured confounding.
RESULTS: A total of 2,246 patients meeting SIMI criteria were enrolled in the 
final cohort, with 17.9% receiving statins during their ICU stay. Statin use was 
associated with significantly lower mortality at all time points, as shown by 
Kaplan-Meier analysis. In multivariable robust Cox regression models, statin 
therapy correlated with a 32% reduction in 28-day mortality (HR = 0.68, 95% CI: 
0.49-0.94), a 29% reduction at 90 days (HR = 0.71, 95% CI: 0.54-0.93), and a 28% 
reduction at 1 year (HR = 0.72, 95% CI: 0.58-0.90), maintaining significance 
after adjustment for confounders. Simvastatin was particularly effective, and 
low-dose statins were linked to reduced mortality risk. Subgroup analyses 
suggested consistent statin benefits. E-Value analysis suggested robustness to 
unmeasured confounding.
CONCLUSION: Our study demonstrates that statin use is significantly associated 
with reduced mortality in SIMI patients across 28 days, 90 days, and 1 year. 
Simvastatin provides substantial benefits, with low-dose statins providing 
greater advantages compared to high-dose formulations.

This paper targets a major challenge of how to effectively allocate medical 
resources in intensive care units (ICUs). We trained multiple regression models 
using the Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care III (MIMIC III) database 
recorded in the period between 2001 and 2012. The training and validation 
dataset included pneumonia, sepsis, congestive heart failure, hypotension, chest 
pain, coronary artery disease, fever, respiratory failure, acute coronary 
syndrome, shortness of breath, seizure and transient ischemic attack, and aortic 
stenosis patients' recorded data. Then we tested the models on the unseen data 
of patients diagnosed with coronary artery disease, congestive heart failure or 
acute coronary syndrome. We included the admission characteristics, clinical 
prescriptions, physiological measurements, and discharge characteristics of 
those patients. We assessed the models' performance using mean residuals and 
running times as metrics. We ran multiple experiments to study the data 
partition's impact on the learning phase. The total running time of our 
best-evaluated model is 123,450.9 mS. The best model gives an average accuracy 
of 98%, highlighting the location of discharge, initial diagnosis, location of 
admission, drug therapy, length of stay and internal transfers as the most 
influencing patterns to decide a patient's readiness for discharge.

BACKGROUND: Previous models on prediction of shock mostly focused on septic 
shock and often required laboratory results in their models. The purpose of this 
study was to use deep learning approaches to predict vasopressor requirement for 
critically ill patients within 24 h of intensive care unit (ICU) admission using 
only vital signs.
METHODS: We used data from the Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care III 
database and the eICU Collaborative Research Database to develop a vasopressor 
prediction model. We performed systematic data preprocessing using matching of 
cohorts, oversampling, and imputation to control for bias, class imbalance, and 
missing data. Bidirectional long short-term memory (Bi-LSTM), a multivariate 
time series model, was used to predict the need for vasopressor therapy using 
serial physiological data collected 21 h prior to prediction time.
RESULTS: Using data from 10,941 critically ill patients from 209 ICUs, our model 
achieved an initial area under the curve of 0.96 (95% CI 0.96-0.96) to predict 
the need for vasopressor therapy in 2 h within the first day of ICU admission. 
After matching to control class imbalance, the Bi-LSTM model had area under the 
curve of 0.83 (95% CI 0.82-0.83). Heart rate, respiratory rate, and mean 
arterial pressure contributed most to the model.
CONCLUSIONS: We used Bi-LSTM to develop a model to predict the need for 
vasopressor for critically ill patients for the first 24 h of ICU admission. 
With attention mechanism, respiratory rate, mean arterial pressure, and heart 
rate were identified as key sequential determinants of vasopressor requirements.

BACKGROUND AND IMPORTANCE: Hyperoxemia may be associated with increased 
mortality in emergency room or ICU patients. However, its effect during septic 
shock is still debated.
OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the effect of hyperoxemia on ICU mortality, during the 
first 24 h of ICU stay, in mechanically ventilated patients with septic shock 
according to SEPSIS-3 criteria.
DESIGN, SETTINGS AND PARTICIPANTS: A retrospective cohort study of ICU 
admissions recorded in the Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care-III, a 
retrospective ICU database, was performed.
INTERVENTION: Two oxygen exposures during the first 24 h were compared: average 
PaO2 (TWA-PaO2) between 70 and 120 mmHg in the normoxemia group and above 120 
mmHg in the hyperoxemia group.
OUTCOME MEASURES AND ANALYSIS: The primary outcome was mortality during ICU 
stay.
MAIN RESULTS: Four hundred eighty-eight ICU admissions met the inclusion 
criteria: 214 in the normoxemia group and 274 in the hyperoxemia group. The 
median TWA-PaO2 was 99.1 (88.9-107.6) mmHg in the normoxemia group and 151.5 
(133.6-180.2) mmHg in the hyperoxemia group. ICU mortality was lower in the 
hyperoxemia group than in the normoxemia group in univariate analysis [29.6 vs. 
39.7%, respectively; OR 0.64 (0.44-0.93); P = 0.024], but not in multivariate 
analysis [OR 0.98 (0.62-1.56); P = 0.93]. There was no difference between the 
two groups in ICU length of stay [8.0 (4.3-15.0) vs. 8.4 (4.7-15.0) days; P = 
0.82].
CONCLUSION: We did not find any impact of early hyperoxemia on mortality in this 
population of mechanically ventilated patients with SEPSIS-3 septic shock 
criteria.

BACKGROUND: Red blood cell distribution width (RDW) to albumin ratio (RAR) is 
associated with poor prognosis in diabetic comorbidities and cancer. However, 
the association between RAR and prognosis in patients with sepsis remains 
unclear, which was investigated in this study.
METHODS: We conducted a retrospective cohort study based on the Medical 
Information Mart for Intensive Care (MIMIC) IV version 2.0 database. The primary 
outcome of this study was 28-day mortality. Secondary outcomes included 90-day 
mortality, in-hospital mortality, length of hospital stay, and length of 
intensive care unit (ICU) stay. Multivariate regression analysis and subgroup 
analysis were performed to investigate the association between RAR and prognosis 
in patients with sepsis.
RESULTS: A total of 14,639 participants were included in this study. The mean 
age of the participants was 65.2 ± 16.3 years and the mean RAR was 5.5 ± 1.9 % 
/g/dl. For 28-day mortality, after adjusting for covariates, HRs [95% confidence 
intervals (CIs)] for tertiles 2 (4.4-5.8) and 3 (RAR > 5.8) were 1.33 (1.20, 
1.46) and 1.98 (1.79, 2.19), respectively. Similar results were observed for 
90-day mortality and in-hospital mortality. According to Kaplan-Meier curve 
analysis, the higher RAR group had higher 28-day mortality and 90-day mortality.
CONCLUSION: Our study shows that RAR is significantly associated with poor 
clinical prognosis in sepsis. The higher the RAR, the higher the 28-day, 90-day, 
and in-hospital mortality.

BACKGROUND: Sepsis, a grave systemic infection, presents substantial health 
challenges. While insulin resistance frequently occurs in sepsis conditions, its 
relationship with sepsis-associated delirium remains insufficiently explored.
AIM: This study aimed to explore the causal effect between the triglyceride 
glucose (TyG) index and its risk of delirium in patients with sepsis through the 
use of causal inference.
STUDY DESIGN: A cohort of 5461 sepsis patients admitted to the intensive care 
unit (ICU) was selected from the Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care IV 
database. Patients were grouped into high TyG (≥9.48) and low TyG (<9.48) 
categories. Propensity score matching was applied to control for confounders, 
and the average treatment effect on the treated was calculated.
RESULTS: Of the 5461 patients, 59.6% experienced delirium. The incidence of 
delirium was higher in the high TyG group (1751 patients; 66.6%) than in the low 
TyG group (56.3%) (p < .001). The results of the logistic regression analysis 
indicated that the risk of delirium was significantly higher in the high TyG 
group (adjusted odds ratio 1.34, 95% confidence interval: 1.16-1.53). Following 
matching, the delirium risk increased by 6.9% in the high TyG group (T = 3.29), 
a finding that was confirmed by a Rosenbaum sensitivity analysis.
CONCLUSIONS: The TyG index represents a straightforward and efficacious 
instrument for nursing staff to ascertain the likelihood of delirium in patients 
with sepsis during the routine monitoring of their condition. The ability to 
make causal inferences in observational studies provides a novel approach to 
research.
RELEVANCE TO CLINICAL PRACTICE: The TyG index represents a readily applicable 
instrument for ICU nurses to identify the risk of delirium in sepsis patients. 
This enables the possibility of early intervention in high-risk individuals and 
the optimization of care outcomes.

Objective To analyze the risk factors of septic cardiomyopathy (SC),and to 
construct and evaluate the risk prediction model of SC. Methods The clinical 
data of patients with sepsis were extracted from MIMIC-Ⅳ database and randomized 
into a training set and a validation set at a ratio of 7 to 3.According to the 
presence or absence of SC,the patients were assigned into SC and non-SC 
groups.The independent risk factors of SC were determined by univariate and 
multivariate Logistic regression analysis,and a risk prediction model and a 
nomogram were established.The area under the receiver operating characteristic 
curve (AUC),calibration curve,and decision curve analysis (DCA) were employed to 
evaluate the distinguishing degree,calibration,and clinical applicability of the 
model,respectively. Results A total of 2628 sepsis patients were enrolled in 
this study,including 1865 patients in the training set and 763 patients in the 
validation set.There was no significant difference in the incidence of SC 
between the training set and the validation set (58.98% vs. 
62.25%,P=0.120).Except chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (P=0.015) and 
length of stay in intensive care unit (P=0.016),there was no significant 
difference in other clinical indicators between the two groups (all 
P>0.05).Logistic regression analysis showed that coronary heart disease 
(P=0.028),heart failure (P<0.001),increased neutrophil count (P=0.001),decreased 
lymphocyte count (P=0.036),increased creatine kinase isoenzyme (P<0.001),and 
increased blood urea nitrogen (P=0.042) were independent risk factors for SC.The 
AUC of the nomogram prediction model in the training set and validation set was 
0.759 (95% CI=0.732-0.785) and 0.765 (95% CI=0.723-0.807),respectively.The 
established model showcased good fitting degrees in both data sets (training 
set:P=0.075;validation set:P=0.067).The DCA results showed that the nomogram 
prediction model had good clinical applicability. Conclusion The nomogram 
prediction model based on basic diseases and clinical biochemical indicators can 
effectively predict the risk of SC occurrence.

BACKGROUND: In recent years, septic shock remains a common fatal disease in the 
intensive care unit (ICU). After sufficient fluid resuscitation, some patients 
still experience tachycardia, which may lead to adverse effects on cardiac 
function. However, the use of β-blockers in the treatment of septic shock 
remains controversial. Thus, the purpose of this study is to evaluate the 
efficacy of β-blockers in the treatment of patients with septic shock and 
explore the most appropriate patient subgroups for this treatment.
METHODS: This retrospective observational study enrolled septic shock patients 
from the Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care (MIMIC)-IV and used 
propensity score matching (PSM) to balance some baseline differences between 
patients with and without β-blockers treatment. The primary outcome was the 
28-day mortality. Length of stay (LOS) in the ICU and hospital, and the degree 
of support for organs such as circulatory, respiratory and renal systems were 
also assessed. Subgroup analysis and multivariate logistic regression were 
performed to determine the relationship between β-blockers therapy and 28-day 
mortality in different patient groups.
RESULTS: A total of 4,860 septic shock patients were enrolled in this study and 
619 pairs were finally matched after PSM. Our analysis revealed that β-blocker 
therapy was associated with a significant improvement in 28-day mortality (21.5% 
vs. 27.1%; P = 0.020) and led to a prolonged LOS in both the ICU and hospital. 
Subgroup analysis indicated that there was an interaction between cardiovascular 
diseases and β-blocker therapy in patients with septic shock. Patients with 
pre-existing heart disease or atrial arrhythmias were more likely to derive 
benefits from β-blocker treatment.
CONCLUSION: We found β-blockers therapy was effective to improve 28-day 
mortality in patients with septic shock. Patients in the subgroup with 
cardiovascular diseases were more likely to benefit from β-blockers in 
mortality.

BACKGROUND: Invasive mechanical ventilation plays an important role in the 
prognosis of patients with sepsis. However, there are, currently, no tools 
specifically designed to assess weaning from invasive mechanical ventilation in 
patients with sepsis. The aim of our study was to develop a practical model to 
predict weaning in patients with sepsis.
METHODS: We extracted patient information from the Medical Information Mart for 
Intensive Care Database-IV (MIMIC-IV) and the eICU Collaborative Research 
Database (eICU-CRD). Kaplan-Meier curves were plotted to compare the 28-day 
mortality between patients who successfully weaned and those who failed to wean. 
Subsequently, MIMIC-IV was divided into a training set and an internal 
verification set, and the eICU-CRD was designated as the external verification 
set. We selected the best model to simplify the internal and external validation 
sets based on the performance of the model.
RESULTS: A total of 5020 and 7081 sepsis patients with invasive mechanical 
ventilation in MIMIC-IV and eICU-CRD were included, respectively. After 
matching, weaning was independently associated with 28-day mortality and length 
of ICU stay (p < 0.001 and p = 0.002, respectively). After comparison, 35 
clinical variables were extracted to build weaning models. XGBoost performed the 
best discrimination among the models in the internal and external validation 
sets (AUROC: 0.80 and 0.86, respectively). Finally, a simplified model was 
developed based on XGBoost, which included only four variables. The simplified 
model also had good predictive performance (AUROC:0.75 and 0.78 in internal and 
external validation sets, respectively) and was developed into a web-based tool 
for further review.
CONCLUSIONS: Weaning success is independently related to short-term mortality in 
patients with sepsis. The simplified model based on the XGBoost algorithm 
provides good predictive performance and great clinical applicablity for 
weaning, and a web-based tool was developed for better clinical application.

PURPOSE: Aspirin is widely used in patients in the intensive care unit (ICU); 
nonetheless, its effects on these patients remain controversial. This 
retrospective analysis of data from clinical practice investigated the effects 
of aspirin on 28-day mortality in ICU patients.
METHODS: This retrospective study included data from patients in the Medical 
Information Mart for Intensive Care (MIMIC)-III database and the 
eICU-Collaborative Research Database (CRD). Patients aged 18 to 90 years and 
admitted to the ICU were eligible and were assigned to one of two groups 
according to whether they were given aspirin during their ICU stay. Multiple 
imputation was used for patients with >10% missing data. Multivariate Cox models 
and propensity score analysis were used to estimate the association of aspirin 
treatment with 28-day mortality among patients admitted to the ICU.
FINDINGS: In total, 146,191 patients were enrolled in this study, and 27,424 
(18.8%) used aspirin. Aspirin treatment in ICU patients, especially in nonseptic 
patients, was associated with a lower 28-day all-cause mortality on multivariate 
Cox analysis (eICU-CRD, hazard ratio [HR] = 0.81, [95% CI, 0.75-0.87]; 
MIMIC-III, HR = 0.72 [95% CI, 0.68-0.76]). Aspirin treatment was associated with 
lower 28-day all-cause mortality after propensity score matching (eICU-CRD, 
HR = 0.80 [95% CI, 0.72-0.88]; MIMIC-III, HR = 0.80 [95% CI, 0.76-0.85]). 
However, on subgroup analysis, aspirin therapy was not associated with a lower 
28-day mortality in patients without systemic inflammatory response syndrome 
(SIRS) symptoms or with sepsis in either database.
IMPLICATIONS: Aspirin treatment during the ICU stay was associated with a 
significantly reduced 28-day all-cause mortality, particularly in patients with 
SIRS symptoms but without sepsis. In patients with sepsis and with/without SIRS 
symptoms, beneficial effects were not clear, or more careful patient selection 
is required.

PURPOSE: To develop and validate a user-friendly model to predict the risk of 
in-hospital mortality in solid cancer patients admitted to the ICU with sepsis.
METHODS: Clinical data of critically ill patients with solid cancer and sepsis 
were obtained from Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care-IV database and 
randomly assigned to the training cohort and validation cohort. The primary 
outcome was in-hospital mortality. The least absolute shrinkage and selection 
operator (LASSO) regression and logistic regression analysis were used to 
feature selection and model development. The performance of the model was 
validated and a dynamic nomogram was developed to visualize the model.
RESULTS: A total of 1584 patients were included in this study, of whom 1108 were 
assigned to the training cohort and 476 to the validation cohort. The LASSO 
regression and logistic multivariable analysis showed that nine clinical 
features were associated with in-hospital mortality and enrolled in the model. 
The area under the curve of the model was 0.809 (95% CI 0.782-0.837) in the 
training cohort and 0.770 (95% CI 0.722-0.819) in the validation cohort. The 
model exhibited satisfactory calibration curves and Brier scores in the training 
set and validation set were 0.149 and 0.152, respectively. The decision curve 
analysis and clinical impact curve of the model presented good clinical 
practicability in both the two cohorts.
CONCLUSION: This predictive model could be used to assess the in-hospital 
mortality of solid cancer patients with sepsis in the ICU, and a dynamic online 
nomogram could facilitate the sharing of the model.

Association between Lactate Dehydrogenase and 30-Day Mortality in Patients with 
Sepsis: a Retrospective Cohort Study.

Liu Z, Liu F, Liu C, Chen X.

BACKGROUND: Sepsis is one of the major causes of death in intensive care unit 
patients, so it is urgent to explore indicators for rapid and effective 
screening of sepsis mortality risk. The purpose of this study is to explore the 
association of LDH level with 30-day mortality in sepsis patients to improve 
patient survival outcomes.
METHODS: In this retrospective cohort study, a total of 5,275 patients with 
sepsis from the Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care IV (MIMIC-IV). LDH 
level at admission was obtained, and the outcome indicator was the 30-day 
mortality. Multivariate Cox regression and Kaplan-Meier survival curve analysis 
were used to assess the relationship between LDH level and 30-day mortality in 
patients with sepsis.
RESULTS: A total of 5,275 patients with sepsis were screened, the 30-day 
mortality was 51.5%. In multivariate regression models, hazard ratio [HR] and 
95% confidence interval [CI] for Log2 and LDH ≥ 250 UI/L were 1.33 (1.29 - 1.37) 
and 1.69 (1.54 - 1.85), respectively. Kaplan-Meier survival curve analysis 
suggested that LDH level is associated with prognosis in patients with sepsis.
CONCLUSIONS: LDH level was associated with 30-day mortality, which can be used 
as an important predictor of clinical outcomes for patients.

OBJECTIVE: The objective of this study was to investigate the association 
between total bilirubin and acute kidney injury (AKI) in neonates admitted to 
neonatal intensive care units (NICU).
METHODS: All data utilized were extracted from Medical Information Mart for 
Intensive Care-III (MIMIC-III) in this retrospective cohort study. The primary 
outcome was the occurrence of AKI during hospitalization in the NICU, and the 
exposure was the initial measurement of total bilirubin levels within 24 h of 
neonatal admission to the NICU. The relationship between serum total bilirubin 
and AKI was evaluated by employing univariate and multivariate logistic 
regression models. Additionally, subgroup analyses were conducted based on birth 
weight, sepsis, and mechanical ventilation.
RESULTS: This retrospective cohort study included a population of 1,726 
neonates, and 95 neonates developed AKI. Total bilirubin, as a continuous 
variable, was linked with decreased AKI risk among neonates admitted to the NICU 
[odds ratio (OR) = 0.77, 95% confidence interval (CI): 0.64-0.92]. Similarly, 
when total bilirubin levels were categorized by tertiles, tertiles 3 showed a 
significant association with decreased AKI risk (OR = 0.39, 95%CI: 0.19-0.83). 
The relationship of total bilirubin level and AKI was also existent among 
neonates admitted to the NICU who were underweight, had not sepsis, and received 
mechanical ventilation.
CONCLUSION: Total bilirubin level may be a protective factor for the risk of 
developing AKI.

BACKGROUND: Sepsis-associated acute kidney injury (SA-AKI) is common in 
critically ill patients, which is associated with significantly increased 
mortality. Existing mortality prediction tools showed insufficient predictive 
power or failed to reflect patients' dynamic clinical evolution. Therefore, the 
study aimed to develop and validate machine learning-based models for real-time 
mortality prediction in critically ill patients with SA-AKI.
METHODS: The multi-center retrospective study included patients from two 
distinct databases. A total of 12,132 SA-AKI patients from the Medical 
Information Mart for Intensive Care IV (MIMIC-IV) were randomly allocated to the 
training, validation, and internal test sets. An additional 3,741 patients from 
the eICU Collaborative Research Database (eICU-CRD) served as an external test 
set. For every 12 h during the ICU stays, the state-of-the-art eXtreme Gradient 
Boosting (XGBoost) algorithm was used to predict the risk of in-hospital death 
in the following 48, 72, and 120 h and in the first 28 days after ICU admission. 
Area under the receiver operating characteristic curves (AUCs) were calculated 
to evaluate the models' performance.
RESULTS: The XGBoost models, based on routine clinical variables updated every 
12 h, showed better performance in mortality prediction than the SOFA score and 
SAPS-II. The AUCs of the XGBoost models for mortality over different time 
periods ranged from 0.848 to 0.804 in the internal test set and from 0.818 to 
0.748 in the external test set. The shapley additive explanation method provided 
interpretability for the XGBoost models, which improved the understanding of the 
association between the predictor variables and future mortality.
CONCLUSIONS: The interpretable machine learning XGBoost models showed promising 
performance in real-time mortality prediction in critically ill patients with 
SA-AKI, which are useful tools for early identification of high-risk patients 
and timely clinical interventions.

BACKGROUND: As a novel inflammatory index, the ratio of red cell distribution 
width (RDW) to platelet count (RPR) may have prognostic value in some critical 
illnesses. However, studies on the prognostic influence of RPR in patients with 
sepsis are few. This study is aimed at investigating the association between RPR 
levels and 28-day mortality in patients with sepsis.
METHODS: Data of patients with sepsis were obtained from the Medical Information 
Mart for Intensive Care III database. The best cut-off value was calculated by 
establishing the receiver operating characteristic curve (ROC), and the 
predictive ability of different indicators was compared through the area under 
the curve (AUC). The association between RPR levels and 28-day mortality was 
assessed using the Cox proportional hazards model. Restrictive cubic spline 
analysis was applied to the multivariable Cox model to investigate the nonlinear 
relationship between RPR and 28-day mortality.
RESULTS: A total of 3367 patients with sepsis were included in the study. A 
nonlinear relationship was observed between RPR and 28-day mortality, showing a 
trend of a first rapid increase and a gradual increase. For the prediction of 
mortality, the best cut-off value for RPR was 0.109, with an AUC of 0.728 (95% 
confidence interval [CI]: 0.709-0.747). The predictive capability of RPR was 
superior to those of RDW, platelet, SOFA score, and SAPS II score. After 
adjusting for various confounding factors, high RPR was significantly associated 
with increased mortality with adjusted hazard ratios of 1.210 (95% CI: 
1.045-1.400) for categorical variables and 2.826 (95% CI: 2.025-3.944) for 
continuous variables.
CONCLUSION: Elevated RPR level is significantly correlated with a high risk of 
28-day mortality in patients with sepsis and can be a new predictor of patient 
prognosis.

Background: Sepsis is a deadly disease worldwide. Effective treatment strategy 
of sepsis remains limited. There still was a controversial about association 
between preadmission metformin use and mortality in sepsis patients with 
diabetes. We aimed to assess sepsis-related mortality in patients with type 2 
diabetes (T2DM) who were preadmission metformin and non-metformin users. 
Methods: The patients with sepsis and T2DM were included from Medical 
Information Mart for Intensive Care -III database. Outcome was 30-day mortality. 
We used multivariable Cox regression analyses to calculate adjusted hazard ratio 
(HR) with 95% CI. Results: We included 2,383 sepsis patients with T2DM (476 and 
1,907 patients were preadmission metformin and non-metformin uses) between 2001 
and 2012. The overall 30-day mortality was 20.1% (480/2,383); it was 21.9% 
(418/1,907), and 13.0% (62/476) for non-metformin and metformin users, 
respectively. After adjusted for potential confounders, we found that 
preadmission metformin use was associated with 39% lower of 30-day mortality (HR 
= 0.61, 95% CI: 0.46-0.81, p = 0.007). In sensitivity analyses, subgroups 
analyses, and propensity score matching, the results remain stable. Conclusions: 
Preadmission metformin use may be associated with reduced risk-adjusted 
mortality in patients with sepsis and T2DM. It is worthy to further investigate 
this association.

BACKGROUND: Red blood cell (RBC) distribution width (RDW) to albumin ratio is a 
novel biomarker and its prognostic effect on critically ill patients with sepsis 
has not been extensively investigated. The objective of this study was to 
identify the prognostic value of the RDW to albumin ratio in these patients.
METHODS: Data were extracted from the Medical Information Mart for Intensive 
Care III (MIMIC-III) database. A Cox proportional hazards model and restricted 
cubic spline model were used to determine the association of RDW to albumin 
ratio with mortality. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves and 
Kaplan-Meier survival curves were applied, and the area under the curve (AUC) 
was used to compare the predictive value.
RESULTS: A total of 3,969 eligible patients were enrolled. The median RDW to 
albumin ratio was significantly higher in non-survivors than in survivors at 30 
and 90 days. Patients were divided into groups according to the RDW to albumin 
ratio, and the risk of 30- and 90-day mortality markedly increased in the group 
with a higher ratio. The relationship between the RDW to albumin ratio as a 
continuous variable and 30-day mortality also showed an upward trend in the 
restricted cubic spline. The AUC of the RDW to albumin ratio was 0.633 in 
discriminating 30-day mortality which was similar to that of the lactate to 
albumin ratio (AUC =0.617; P=0.133) and higher than that of the neutrophil 
percentage to albumin ratio (AUC =0.559; P<0.001).
CONCLUSIONS: The RDW to albumin ratio is a promising biomarker for assessing the 
prognosis of critically ill patients with sepsis. Its predictive value in 
determining mortality was found to be similar to that of the lactate to albumin 
ratio and superior to that of the neutrophil percentage to albumin ratio.

INTRODUCTION: Limited data are available on the use, duration, and dosage of 
anticoagulant therapy in patients with pneumonia-induced sepsis, and the 
survival benefits of heparin remain uncertain. This study aimed to assess 
whether heparin administration improves near-term survival in critically ill 
patients with pneumonia-induced sepsis and identify the optimal dosage and 
treatment duration.
METHODS: This study utilized the Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care-IV 
(MIMIC-IV) database. The variance inflation factor was employed to exclude 
highly collinear variables. Propensity score matching (PSM), the Cox 
proportional hazards model, and Cox regression subgroup analysis were used to 
evaluate the outcomes of subcutaneous heparin prophylactic anticoagulation after 
intensive care unit (ICU) admission. The primary outcomes were 30-, 45-, and 
60-d mortality rates. Secondary outcomes included ICU length of stay (LOS_ICU), 
hospital length of stay (LOS_Hospital), in-hospital mortality, and the incidence 
of gastrointestinal bleeding.
RESULTS: We enrolled 1,586 adult patients with pneumonia-induced sepsis. After 
PSM, 1,176 patients remained (588 in the heparin group and 588 in the 
non-heparin group). The 45-d survival rate was significantly higher in the 
heparin-treated group than that in the non-heparin group (84.4% vs. 79.4%; HR: 
0.75; 95% CI: 0.572-0.83; adjusted HR: 0.73, 95% CI: 0.563-0.964; P < 0.05). 
LOS_ICU and LOS_Hospital were significantly shorter in the heparin group (P < 
0.001), with no significant difference in gastrointestinal bleeding incidence 
between the two groups. Cox proportional hazards models demonstrated that 
heparin dose and duration were strongly associated with 45-d survival. Subgroup 
analysis indicated a significant survival advantage in patients aged 
18-60 years, without diabetes, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, or stage 1 
acute kidney injury, who received a daily heparin dose of 3 mL for more than 
7 d.
CONCLUSION: Our study found that early administration of heparin, particularly 
in sufficient doses (Heparin Sodium 5,000 units/mL, 1 mL per dose, three times 
daily (TID)) for more than 7 d, was associated with reduced near-term mortality 
in critically ill patients with pneumonia-induced sepsis. These findings 
underscore the potential benefits of anticoagulant therapy in this high-risk 
patient population.

BACKGROUND: Sepsis is a critical condition with a significant risk of mortality. 
Advanced age is one factor in increasing mortality in intensive care.
OBJECTIVES: The aim of this study is to investigate the association between mean 
heart rate (MHR) and 30-day mortality among older patients with sepsis in the 
intensive care unit (ICU).
METHODS: All older patients (age 65 or older) with sepsis for first time in ICU 
admission in Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care-IV (MIMIC-IV) were 
included in this retrospective study. The effect of MHR within 24 h of ICU 
admission on 30-day mortality was assessed according to multivariable Cox 
regression models, restricted cubic splines and two-piecewise Cox regression 
models.
RESULTS: The total number of participants was 6598 (mean heart rate, 83.8 ± 14.3 
bpm). A total of 1295 (19.6%) patients died within 30 days after ICU admission. 
MHR within 24 h of admission was associated with 30-day mortality (J-shaped 
association) in older patients with sepsis in the ICU, with an inflection point 
at about 74 bpm and a minimal risk observed at 73 to 82 bpm of MHR.
CONCLUSIONS: In this retrospective cohort study, there was a J-shaped 
association between MHR and 30-day mortality in older patients with sepsis 
admitted to the ICU and a minimal risk observed at 73 to 82 bpm of MHR. If 
further confirmed, this association may provide a theoretical basis for 
formulating the target strategy of heart rate therapy for these patients.

This study was conducted to investigate the relationship between atrial 
fibrillation and the clinical prognosis of patients with sepsis in intensive 
care unit. A total of 21,538 sepsis patients were enrolled in the study based on 
the Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care IV database, of whom 6,759 had 
AF. Propensity score matching was used to compare the clinical characteristics 
and outcomes of patients with and without AF. Besides, the inverse probability 
of treatment weighting, univariate and multivariate Cox regression analyzes were 
performed. Of the 21,538 patients, 31.4% had AF. The prevalence of AF increased 
in a step-by-step manner with growing age. Patients with AF were older than 
those without AF. After PSM, 11,180 patients remained, comprising 5,790 matched 
pairs in both groups. In IPTW, AF was not associated with 28-day mortality 
[hazard ratio (HR), 1.07; 95% confidence interval (CI), 0.99-1.15]. In 
Kaplan-Meier analysis, it was not observed difference of 28-day mortality 
between patients with and without AF. AF could be associated with increased ICU 
LOS, hospital LOS and need for mechanical ventilation; however, it does not 
remain an independent short-term predictor of 28-day mortality among patients 
with sepsis after PSM with IPTW and multivariate analysis.

BACKGROUND: The relationship between albumin corrected anion gap (ACAG) and 
in-hospital mortality of intensive care sepsis patients is currently 
inconclusive.
METHODS: The baseline data, concentration of albumin, anion gap (AG), ACAG and 
in-hospital prognosis of intensive care patients with sepsis were retrieved from 
the Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care IV database. Propensity score 
matching (PSM) analysis was performed to reduce bias. Receiver operating 
characteristic curves were drawn for albumin, AG, and ACAG, and comparisons 
between the areas under the ROC curves were conducted. Decision curve analysis 
(DCA) was performed to determine the net benefit of ACAG.
RESULTS: ACAG was related to in-hospital mortality in intensive care patients 
with sepsis. The AUCs of ACAG were 0.689 (before PSM) and 0.644 (after PSM), 
which were significantly higher than that of albumin or AG. The Youden's index 
of ACAG was the highest, and the net benefit range of ACAG was also the largest 
according to the DCA.
CONCLUSIONS: ACAG has the highest predictive value for in-hospital mortality of 
intensive care patients with sepsis, which is better than albumin and AG. Using 
ACAG to predict the in-hospital mortality to guide clinical applications may 
obtain the highest net benefit.

OBJECTIVE: To investigate the relationship between the changes of immune indexes 
and prognosis in patients with sepsis.
METHODS: Based on the hospitalization information from 2008 to 2019 in the 
American Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care-IV v2.0 (MIMIC-IV v2.0), 
the hospitalized data including CD3 count, CD4 count, CD8 count, CD4/CD8 ratio, 
immunoglobulins (IgA, IgG, IgM) levels and lymphocyte counts, gender, age, body 
mass index (BMI), sequential organ failure assessment (SOFA), and prognosis of 
patients with coronary heart disease, hypertension, diabetes mellitus, 
underlying diseases, and 28-day prognosis were collected. The immunological 
indexes affecting the prognosis of patients with sepsis were compared and 
analyzed. The receiver operator characteristic curve (ROC curve) was drawn to 
analyze the value of immunological indexes in predicting the 28-day prognosis of 
patients with sepsis.
RESULTS: A total of 33 745 patients were enrolled in the study, including 1 509 
cases of sepsis and 32 236 cases without sepsis. Among the patients with sepsis, 
there were 1 084 cases alive and 425 cases died within 28 days. BMI (kg/m2: 
33.25±28.71 vs. 28.90±15.28) and IgA levels within 3 days and 7 days after 
admission in sepsis group were significantly higher than those in the non-sepsis 
group [within 3 days after admission: (275.01±216.96) mg/L vs. (85.99±75.76) 
mg/L; within 7 days after admission: (275.01±216.96) mg/L vs. (85.99±75.76) 
mg/L, all P < 0.05]. CD3 count, CD8 count within 3 days and 7 days after 
admission in sepsis group were significantly lower than that in the non-sepsis 
group [within 3 days after admission: CD3 counts were (1 080.74±849.23)/μL vs. 
(1 242.91±889.24)/μL, CD8 counts were (558.07±368.77)/μL vs. (625.07±529.66)/μL; 
within 7 days after admission: CD3 counts were (1 079.69±850.61)/μL vs. (1 
242.48±889.23)/μL, CD8 counts were (556.70±467.23)/μL vs. (624.93±429.78)/μL, 
all P < 0.05]. The proportion of patients with hypertension, diabetes and 
coronary heart disease were significantly higher than those in the non-sepsis 
group [hypertension: 10.07% (152/1 509) vs. 2.47% (796/32 236), diabetes: 50.10% 
(756/1 509) vs.15.18% (4 895/32 236), coronary heart disease: 31.21% (471/1 509) 
vs. 19.19% (6 186/32 236), all P < 0.05]. In the sepsis group, the CD3 count, 
CD4 count and CD4/CD8 ratio in the survival group were significantly higher than 
those in the death group within 3 days and 7 days after admission [within 3 days 
after admission: CD3 counts were (1 127.20±857.14)/μL vs. (938.26±810.50)/μL, 
CD4 counts were (559.76±507.18)/μL vs. (338.75±267.11)/μL, CD4/CD8 ratios were 
1.87±0.80 vs. 1.02±0.12; within 7 days after admission: CD3 count were (1 
124.01±810.53)/μL vs. (943.78±808.21)/μL, CD4 count were (559.56±507.36)/μL vs. 
(341.95±266.56)/μL, CD4/CD8 ratios were 1.88±0.79 vs. 1.03±0.13, all P < 0.05]. 
The area under the ROC curve (AUC) of CD4/CD8 ratio within 3 days after 
admission in predicting the prognosis of septic patients at 28 days was 0.615 
[95% confidence interval (95%CI) was 0.555-0.671], the sensitivity was 70.83%, 
and the specificity was 52.49%.
CONCLUSIONS: Hypertension, coronary heart disease and diabetes are more likely 
to induce sepsis. The changes of immune indexes in patients with sepsis will 
occur in the early stage. Early CD4/CD8 index can predict the prognosis of 
patients with sepsis to a certain extent.

BACKGROUND: Cardiac dysfunction, commonly observed in sepsis patients, is 
associated with higher mortality rates. The left ventricular stroke work index 
(LVSWI), an integrated parameter reflecting overall left ventricular function, 
may serve as a reliable and practical prognosticator for sepsis.
METHODS: Using the Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care (MIMIC III) 
database, we carried out a retrospective observational study that included adult 
patients who met the Sepsis-3 criteria. Kaplan-Meier survival curves and Cox 
proportional hazard models were applied to examine the association between LVSWI 
and 30-day all-cause mortality. Restricted cubic spline plots were used to 
assess the non-linear relationship between LVSWI and mortality, and subgroup 
analyses were conducted across various variables.
RESULTS: A total of 1,348 septic patients were included, with 300 (22.3%) 
fatalities. In multivariate Cox proportional hazard models, a significant 
negative relationship between LVSWI and mortality was observed, with a 31% 
reduction in mortality risk associated with an increase of one standard 
deviation in LVSWI (hazard ratio [HR]: 0.69, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 
0.51-0.93, p = 0.016), following adjustment for confounders. Restricted cubic 
spline plots unveiled a non-linear, L-shaped relationship between LVSWI and 
mortality. Furthermore, a two-piecewise regression model identified the critical 
inflection point at 27.83 g·m/m², with HR (95% CI) values of 0.93 (0.90-0.96; 
p < 0.001) on the left and 1.00 (0.99-1.01; p = 0.913) on the right.
CONCLUSIONS: The LVSWI exhibited an L-shaped relationship with 30-day mortality 
in patients with sepsis, underscoring the potential of LVSWI as a dependable 
prognostic indicator for sepsis. Further studies are needed to confirm these 
findings and to investigate whether early interventions to optimize LVSWI could 
improve outcomes in this patient population.

BACKGROUND: This study was to examine the association between treatment with 
angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEIs) or angiotensin receptor 
blockers (ARBs) and the risk of developing ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) 
among patients receiving mechanical ventilation (MV) in the intensive care unit 
(ICU).
METHODS: Utilizing a retrospective cohort approach, the data were extracted from 
the Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care IV database. VAP diagnoses were 
ascertained through the international classification of disease codes recorded 
in the database. Both univariate and multivariable logistic regression analyses 
were conducted to assess the association between ACEI or ARB use and VAP. 
Subgroup analyses were performed to evaluate the impact of comorbidities (AKI, 
renal failure, diabetes, hypertension, and sepsis), simplified acute physiology 
score II (SAPS II), as well as the use of vasopressors and antibiotics on this 
association. Odds ratios (ORs) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were used as 
the evaluation metrics.
RESULTS: The study comprised 8,888 patients, with 897 (10.09%) experiencing VAP. 
The analysis revealed that patients on ACEI or ARB therapy had a lower risk of 
developing VAP (OR: 0.79, 95% CI: 0.62-0.99, P = 0.047). Subgroup analyses 
revealed that the protective effect was observed in patients with AKI (OR: 0.70, 
95% CI: 0.52-0.94, P = 0.020), renal failure (OR: 0.14, 95% CI: 0.02-0.84, 
P = 0.032), and diabetes (OR: 0.64, 95% CI: 0.43-0.94, P = 0.024), as well as in 
those receiving vasopressors (OR: 0.67, 95% CI: 0.49-0.92, P = 0.012), and 
antibiotics (OR: 0.74, 95% CI: 0.57-0.96, P = 0.021). No significant difference 
in VAP development was observed between patients treated with ACEI versus ARB 
(OR: 0.84, 95% CI: 0.49-1.47, P = 0.547).
CONCLUSION: This study's findings suggest a substantial association between the 
use of ACEIs or ARBs and reduced development of VAP, particularly among patients 
with specific comorbidities and those on vasopressor and antibiotic therapy. 
This study may educate the ICU team on the potential benefits of ACEIs and ARBs 
in preventing VAP, emphasizing the importance of considering these medications 
in the overall treatment plan.

INTRODUCTION: Sepsis associated thrombocytopenia (SAT) is a common complication 
of sepsis. We designed this study to investigate factors influencing SAT.
METHODS: Patients with sepsis (2984 in Peking union medical college hospital 
[PUMCH] database, 13165 in eICU Collaborative Research [eICU] database, 11101 in 
Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care IV [MIMIC-IV] database) were 
enrolled. Variables included basic information, comorbidities, and organ 
functions. Multi-variable logistic regression models and artificial neural 
network model were applied to determine the factors related to SAT.
MAIN RESULTS: Age and body mass index (BMI) were inversely correlated with the 
incidence of SAT (p-value 0.175 and 0.049 [PUMCH], p-value 0.000 and 0.000 
[eICU], p-value 0.000 and 0.000 [MIMIC-IV]). Hematologic malignancies and other 
malignancies were positively correlated with the incidence of SAT (p-value 0.000 
and 0.000 [PUMCH], p-value 0.000 and 0.000 [eICU], p-value 0.000 and 0.020 
[MIMIC-IV]) except other malignancies was inversely correlated with the 
incidence of SAT in PUMCH database. Norepinephrine (NE) equivalents, total 
bilirubin (TBIL) and creatinine were positively correlated with the incidence of 
SAT (p-value 0.000, 0.000 and 0.011 [PUMCH], p-value 0.028, 0.000 and 0.013 
[eICU], p-value 0.028, 0.000 and 0.027 [MIMIC-IV]). PaO2 / FiO2 was inversely 
correlated with the incidence of SAT in PUMCH database (p-value 0.021 [PUMCH]), 
while it was positively correlated with the incidence of SAT (p-value 0.000 
[MIMIC-IV]). PaO2 / FiO2 and SAT was not related (p-value 0.111 [eICU]). TBIL, 
hematologic malignancies, PaO2 / FiO2 and NE equivalents ranked in the top five 
significant variables in all three datasets.
CONCLUSIONS: Hematologic malignancies and other malignancies were positively 
correlated with the incidence of SAT. NE equivalents, TBIL and creatinine were 
positively correlated with the incidence of SAT. TBIL, hematologic malignancies, 
PaO2 / FiO2 and NE equivalents ranked in the top significant variables in 
factors influencing SAT.

BACKGROUND: Sepsis is one of the main causes of mortality in intensive care 
units (ICUs). Early prediction is critical for reducing injury. As approximately 
36% of sepsis occur within 24 h after emergency department (ED) admission in 
Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care (MIMIC-IV), a prediction system for 
the ED triage stage would be helpful. Previous methods such as the quick 
Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (qSOFA) are more suitable for screening than 
for prediction in the ED, and we aimed to find a light-weight, convenient 
prediction method through machine learning.
METHODS: We accessed the MIMIC-IV for sepsis patient data in the EDs. Our 
dataset comprised demographic information, vital signs, and synthetic features. 
Extreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost) was used to predict the risk of developing 
sepsis within 24 h after ED admission. Additionally, SHapley Additive 
exPlanations (SHAP) was employed to provide a comprehensive interpretation of 
the model's results. Ten percent of the patients were randomly selected as the 
testing set, while the remaining patients were used for training with 10-fold 
cross-validation.
RESULTS: For 10-fold cross-validation on 14,957 samples, we reached an accuracy 
of 84.1%±0.3% and an area under the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) 
curve of 0.92±0.02. The model achieved similar performance on the testing set of 
1,662 patients. SHAP values showed that the five most important features were 
acuity, arrival transportation, age, shock index, and respiratory rate.
CONCLUSION: Machine learning models such as XGBoost may be used for sepsis 
prediction using only a small amount of data conveniently collected in the ED 
triage stage. This may help reduce workload in the ED and warn medical workers 
against the risk of sepsis in advance.

BACKGROUND: Neutrophil-to-lymphocyte count ratio (NLCR) has been shown as a 
feasible parameter associated with outcomes of tumor patients and an accessible 
predictor of bacteremia. However, only a handful of research shed the light on 
the association between NLCR and outcomes of septic patients. This study is 
aimed to evaluate the association between NLCR and all-cause mortality in a 
population of adult septic patients.
METHODS: We extracted clinical data from Medical Information Mart for Intensive 
Care (MIMIC)-III V1.4, a free, large-scale, single-center database. NLCR was 
computed individually. Patients were categorized by quartiles of NLCR. The 
associations between NLCR quartiles and 28-day all-cause mortality in septic 
patients were assessed using Cox proportional hazards models and subgroup 
analyzes. To evaluate the accuracy of NLCR in predicting 28-day mortality of 
sepsis, receiver operator characteristic curves (ROC), areas under the curve 
(AUC), and the Youden's J Index were calculated. Other outcomes included 7-day 
all-cause mortality, mortality in the intensive care units (ICU), in-hospital 
mortality and length of ICU stay.
RESULTS: A total of 3,043 eligible patients were included in the study, of 
which, 760, 759, 766 and 758 patients were fallen in the first quartile (≤5.89), 
the second quartile (>5.89, ≤10.69), the third quartile (>10.69, ≤20.25) and the 
fourth quartile (>20.25) of NLCR, respectively. The 7-day mortality (13.4%, 
9.9%, 13.6% and 14.2%; P=0.064) showed no difference in the four quartiles. In 
multivariate analysis, after adjusting for confounding factors, the highest NLCR 
quartile (>20.25) was associated with increased 28-day all-cause mortality 
[hazard ratio (HR) 1.22, 95% Cl: 1.01-1.49; P=0.046]. The areas under the 
receiver operating characteristic curves (AUROCs) for NLCR was 0.553 (95% CI: 
0.529-0.576) for 28-day mortality.
CONCLUSIONS: High NLCR (>20.25) is independently related to increased 28-day 
all-cause mortality in adult septic patients of a limited sensibility and 
specificity. Further large multi-center prospective studies are needed to 
confirm such relationship and to validate whose clinical significance.

Background: Plasma is commonly used in patients with coagulopathy; however, its 
role in patients with sepsis-induced coagulopathy (SIC) is unclear. This study 
aimed to evaluate the effect of plasma transfusion on the prognosis of patients 
with SIC. Methods: Data were collected from the Medical Information Mart for 
Intensive Care IV database. Multivariable logistic regression analysis was used 
to determine the association between plasma transfusion and the incidence of 
in-hospital mortality, pulmonary embolism, and lower extremity deep vein 
thrombosis in critically ill patients with SIC. Propensity score matching (PSM) 
and propensity score-based inverse probability of treatment weighting (IPTW) 
models were used to ensure the robustness of our findings. Furthermore, the 
nonparametric relationship between in-hospital mortality and plasma transfusion 
volume was analyzed using restricted cubic spline. Subgroups analyses were 
performed for age, sex, Charlson score, Sequential Organ Failure Assessment 
score, SIC score, and with hemorrhage. Results: A total of 8,747 patients with 
SIC were enrolled: of them, 1874 were in the plasma infusion group, and 6,873 
were in the no plasma infusion group. Compared with the no plasma infusion 
group, the plasma infusion group had higher in-hospital mortality (odds ratio 
[OR], 1.4411; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.2280-1.6897, P < 0.05), and the 
results were robust after PSM (OR, 1.3227; 95% CI, 1.1152-1.5697; P < 0.05) and 
IPTW (OR, 1.1541; 95% CI, 1.0738-1.2404; P < 0.05). Similar results were also 
observed in different subgroups. However, because of conflicting results after 
PSM and IPTW, we were unable to definitively link plasma transfusion with 
pulmonary embolism and deep vein thrombosis. Compared with the no early plasma 
transfusion group (≥12 h), the in-hospital mortality rate was lower in the early 
plasma transfusion group (<12 h) (OR, 0.5426; 95% CI, 0.4398-0.6844; P < 0.05). 
The restricted cubic spline analysis indicated that increased plasma transfusion 
was associated with increased in-hospital mortality in patients with SIC. 
Conclusion: Plasma transfusion increases in-hospital mortality in patients with 
SIC, and the mortality rate increases with the amount of plasma transfusion. 
Patients with SIC who received early plasma infusion had lower in-hospital 
mortality than those who received no early plasma transfusion.

BACKGROUND: Sepsis has the characteristics of high morbidity and high mortality 
in intensive care unit (ICU) patients. Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease 
(COPD) is an important cause of death. Studies have shown the value of aspirin 
on COPD and sepsis, separately, but its role in the combined COPD and sepsis 
patients is unclear. This study aimed to analyze the association of aspirin use 
after ICU admission with the mortality risk in COPD patients with sepsis.
METHODS: We conducted a retrospective study using the Medical Information Mart 
for Intensive Care (MIMIC)-IV database, enrolling 2,964 COPD patients with 
sepsis admitted to ICU. They were divided into aspirin users (n=1,642) and 
non-users (n=1,322). We evaluated the association of aspirin use with 
in-hospital and 28-day mortality using logistic regression, Kaplan-Meier 
survival analysis, and Cox proportional-hazards models. The role of aspirin dose 
and the association of aspirin use with 90-day and 1-year mortality were also 
assessed.
RESULTS: Aspirin use was associated with lower in-hospital death (13.642% vs. 
23.676%) and 28-day mortality (17.296% vs. 30.257%) (P<0.001). Adjusted models 
confirmed reduced mortality odds ratio (OR) with aspirin use: OR for in-hospital 
mortality was 0.574 [95% confidence interval (CI): 0.456, 0.721] and 28-day 
mortality was 0.539 (95% CI: 0.437, 0.665) in model 3. Survival analyses showed 
higher survival probabilities for aspirin users. Subgroup analyses supported 
consistent aspirin benefits across various clinical parameters. Additionally, 
aspirin users had lower 90-day (21.498% vs. 34.191%) and 1-year mortality 
(27.649% vs. 41.982%) (P<0.001).
CONCLUSIONS: Aspirin use is significantly related to in-hospital and 28-day 
mortality risk in COPD patients with sepsis. This highlighted the clinical 
relevance of aspirin in COPD patients with sepsis.

Acute kidney injury (AKI) is commonly present in critically ill patients with 
sepsis. Early prediction of short-term reversibility of AKI is beneficial to 
risk stratification and clinical treatment decision. The study sought to use 
machine learning methods to discriminate between transient and persistent 
sepsis-associated AKI. Septic patients who developed AKI within the first 48 h 
after ICU admission were identified from the Medical Information Mart for 
Intensive Care III database. AKI was classified as transient or persistent 
according to the Acute Disease Quality Initiative workgroup consensus. Five 
prediction models using logistic regression, random forest, support vector 
machine, artificial neural network and extreme gradient boosting were 
constructed, and their performance was evaluated by out-of-sample testing. A 
simplified risk prediction model was also derived based on logistic regression 
and features selected by machine learning algorithms. A total of 5984 septic 
patients with AKI were included, 3805 (63.6%) of whom developed persistent AKI. 
The artificial neural network and logistic regression models achieved the 
highest area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) among the 
five machine learning models (0.76, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.74-0.78). The 
simplified 14-variable model showed adequate discrimination, with the AUC being 
0.76 (95% CI 0.73-0.78). At the optimal cutoff of 0.63, the sensitivity and 
specificity of the simplified model were 63% and 76% respectively. In 
conclusion, a machine learning-based simplified prediction model including 
routine clinical variables could be used to differentiate between transient and 
persistent AKI in critically ill septic patients. An easy-to-use risk calculator 
can promote its widespread application in daily clinical practice.

Heart failure is a common complication in patients with sepsis, and individuals 
who experience both sepsis and heart failure are at a heightened risk for 
adverse outcomes. This study aims to develop an effective nomogram model to 
predict the 7-day, 15-day, and 30-day survival probabilities of septic patients 
with heart failure in the intensive care unit (ICU). This study extracted the 
pertinent clinical data of septic patients with heart failure from the Critical 
Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care (MIMIC-IV) database. Patients were 
then randomly allocated into a training set and a test set at a ratio of 7:3. 
Cox proportional hazards regression analysis was used to determine independent 
risk factors influencing patient prognosis and to develop a nomogram model. The 
model's efficacy and clinical significance were assessed through metrics such as 
the concordance index (C-index), time-dependent receiver operating 
characteristic (ROC), calibration curve, and decision curve analysis (DCA). A 
total of 5,490 septic patients with heart failure were included in the study. A 
nomogram model was developed to predict short-term survival probabilities, using 
13 variables: age, pneumonia, endotracheal intubation, mechanical ventilation, 
potassium (K), anion gap (AG), lactate (Lac), activated partial thromboplastin 
time (APTT), white blood cell count (WBC), red cell distribution width (RDW), 
hemoglobin-to-red cell distribution width ratio (HRR), Sequential Organ Failure 
Assessment (SOFA) score, and Charlson Comorbidity Index (CCI). The C-index was 
0.730 (95% CI 0.719-0.742) for the training set and 0.761 (95% CI 0.745-0.776) 
for the test set, indicating strong model accuracy, indicating good model 
accuracy. Evaluations via the ROC curve, calibration curve, and decision curve 
analyses further confirmed the model's reliability and utility. This study 
effectively developed a straightforward and efficient nomogram model to predict 
the 7-day, 15-day, and 30-day survival probabilities of septic patients with 
heart failure in the ICU. The implementation of treatment strategies that 
address the risk factors identified in the model can enhance patient outcomes 
and increase survival rates.

BACKGROUND: Renal replacement therapy (RRT) is an important treatment option for 
sepsis-associated acute kidney injury (AKI); however, the optimal timing for its 
initiation remains controversial. Herein, we investigated the clinical outcomes 
of early continuous kidney replacement therapy (CKRT), defined as CKRT 
initiation within 6 hours of sepsis-associated AKI onset, which was earlier than 
the initiation time defined in previous studies.
METHODS: We used clinical data sourced from the Medical Information Mart for 
Intensive Care IV (MIMIC-IV) database. This study included patients aged ≥ 18 
years who met the sepsis diagnostic criteria and received CKRT because of stage 
2 or 3 AKI. Early and late CKRTs were defined as CKRT initiation within 6 hours 
and after 6 hours of the development of sepsis-associated AKI, respectively.
RESULTS: Of the 33,236 patients diagnosed with sepsis, 553 underwent CKRT for 
sepsis-associated AKI. After excluding cases of early mortality and patients 
with a dialysis history, 45 and 334 patients were included in the early and late 
CKRT groups, respectively. After propensity score matching, the 28-day mortality 
rate was significantly lower in the early CKRT group than in the late CKRT group 
(26.7% vs. 43.9%, P = 0.035). The early CKRT group also had a significantly 
greater number of days free of mechanical ventilation (median, 19; interquartile 
range [IQR], 3-25) and vasopressor administration (median, 21; IQR, 5-26) than 
the late CKRT group did (median, 10.5; IQR, 0-23; P = 0.037 and median, 13.5; 
IQR, 0-25; P = 0.028, respectively). The Kaplan-Meier curve also showed that 
early CKRT initiation was associated with an improved 28-day mortality rate 
(log-rank test, P = 0.040). In contrast, there was no significant difference in 
the 28-day mortality between patients who started CKRT within 12 hours and those 
who did not (log-rank test, P = 0.237).
CONCLUSION: Early CKRT initiation improved the survival of patients with 
sepsis-associated AKI. Initiation of CKRT should be considered as early as 
possible after sepsis-associated AKI onset, preferably within 6 hours.

OBJECTIVES: Diagnosis and management of intensive care unit (ICU)-acquired 
bloodstream infections are often based on positive blood culture results. This 
retrospective cohort study aimed to develop a classification model using 
data-driven characterisation to optimise the management of intensive care 
patients with blood cultures.
SETTING, METHODOLOGY/DESIGN: An unsupervised clustering model was developed 
based on the clinical characteristics of patients with blood cultures in the 
Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care (MIMIC)-IV database (n = 2451). It 
was tested using the data from the MIMIC-III database (n = 2047).
MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: The prognosis, blood culture outcomes, antimicrobial 
interventions, and trajectories of infection indicators were compared between 
clusters.
RESULTS: Four clusters were identified using machine learning-based k-means 
clustering based on data obtained 48 h before the first blood culture sampling. 
Cluster γ was associated with the highest 28-day mortality rate, followed by 
clusters α, δ, and β. Cluster γ had a higher fungal isolation rate than cluster 
β (P < 0.05). Cluster δ was associated with a higher isolation rate of 
Gram-negative organisms and fungi (P < 0.05). Patients in clusters γ and δ 
underwent more femoral site vein catheter placements than those in cluster β 
(P < 0.001, all). Patients with a duration of antibiotics treatment of 4, 6, and 
7 days in clusters α, δ, and γ, respectively, had the lowest 28-day mortality 
rate.
CONCLUSIONS: Machine learning identified four clusters of intensive care 
patients with blood cultures, which yielded different prognoses, blood culture 
outcomes, and optimal duration of antibiotic treatment. Such data-driven blood 
culture classifications suggest further investigation should be undertaken to 
optimise treatment and improve care.
IMPLICATIONS FOR CLINICAL PRACTICE: Intensive care unit-acquired bloodstream 
infections are heterogeneous. Meaningful classifications associated with 
outcomes should be described. Using machine learning and cluster analysis could 
help in understanding heterogeneity. Data-driven blood culture classification 
could identify distinct physiological states and prognoses before deciding on 
blood culture sampling, optimise treatment, and improve care.

OBJECTIVE: To compare the predictive value of Oxford acute severity of illness 
score (OASIS) and simplified acute physiology score II (SAPS II) for in-hospital 
mortality in intensive care unit (ICU) patients with sepsis.
METHODS: A retrospective cohort study was conducted using the data in the 
Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care-IV 0.4 (MIMIC-IV 0.4). Based on 
Sepsis-3 diagnostic criteria, the basic information of ICU adult sepsis patients 
with infection and sequential organ failure assessment (SOFA) score ≥ 2 within 
24 hours of ICU admission admitted for the first time in the database was 
extracted, including gender, age, vasopressor drugs, sedative drugs, mechanical 
ventilation, renal replacement therapy, length of ICU stay, OASIS, SAPS II 
scores, etc. The primary outcome was in-hospital mortality. A receiver operator 
characteristic curve (ROC curve) was drawn, and the area under the ROC curve 
(AUC) was calculated to compare the prognostic value of OASIS score and SAPS II 
score.
RESULTS: A total of 11 098 adult ICU sepsis patients were enrolled in the final 
analysis, of which 2 320 died and 8 778 survived in hospital, with a mortality 
of 20.90%. Compared with the survivors, the non-survivors were older [years old: 
71 (60, 81) vs. 67 (56, 78)], had longer length of ICU stay [days: 6.95 (3.39, 
13.07) vs. 4.23 (2.19, 9.73)] and higher proportions of using vasopressor drugs, 
sedative drugs, mechanical ventilation and renal replacement therapy 
[vasopressor drugs: 50.65% (1 175/2 320) vs. 33.05% (2 901/8 778), sedative 
drugs: 58.53% (1 358/2 320) vs. 48.41% (4 249/8 778), mechanical ventilation: 
89.57% (2 078/2 320) vs. 81.66% (7 168/8 778), renal replacement therapy: 11.98% 
(278/2 320) vs. 6.57% (577/8 778), all P < 0.01]. Moreover, the non-survivors 
had higher OASIS score [43 (36, 49) vs. 35 (29, 41), P < 0.01] and SAPS II score 
[49 (40, 60) vs. 38 (31, 47), P < 0.01] as compared with the survivors. ROC 
curve analysis showed that the AUC of OASIS score and SAPS II score for 
predicting in-hospital death of ICU patients with sepsis was 0.713 [95% 
confidence interval (95%CI) was 0.701-0.725] and 0.716 (95%CI was 0.704-0.728), 
respectively, and the Delong test showed no significant difference in AUC 
between the two scoring systems (P > 0.05).
CONCLUSIONS: OASIS score has a good predictive value for in-hospital mortality 
in sepsis patients, which is similar to SAPS II score. OASIS score is simpler 
and has a broader clinical application prospect than SAPS II score.

BACKGROUND: This study aims to assess the influence of early serum phosphate 
fluctuation on the short-term prognosis of sepsis patients.
METHODS: This retrospective study used the Medical Information Mart for 
Intensive Care IV database to analyze serum phosphate levels in sepsis patients 
within 3 days of ICU admission. According to the absolute value of delta serum 
phosphate (the maximum value minus the minimum value of serum phosphorus 
measured within three days), the patients were divided into four groups, 0-1.3, 
1.4-2.0, 2.1-3.1, and ≥ 3.2 mg/dl. Meanwhile, the direction of delta serum 
phosphate was compared. With the serum phosphate change group of 0-1.3 mg/dl as 
the reference group, the relationship between delta serum phosphate and 
in-hospital mortality and 28-day mortality was analyzed by multivariate 
Logistics regression analysis.
RESULTS: The study involved 1375 sepsis patients. Serum phosphate changes 
(0-1.3, 1.4-2.0, 2.1-3.1, and ≥ 3.2 mg/dl) correlated with in-hospital and 
28-day mortality variations (p = 0.005, p = 0.008). Much higher serum phosphate 
fluctuation elevated in-hospital and 28-day mortality. Compared to the 
0-1.3 mg/dl change group, adjusted odds ratios (OR) in other groups for 
in-hospital mortality were 1.25 (0.86-1.81), 1.28 (0.88-1.86), and 1.63 
(1.10-2.43), and for 28-day mortality were 1.21 (0.86-1.72), 1.10 (0.77-1.57), 
and 1.49 (1.03-2.19). Under the trend of increasing serum phosphate, the ORs of 
in-hospital mortality and 28-day mortality in ≥ 3.2 mg/dl group were 2.52 and 
2.01, respectively.
CONCLUSION: In conclude, the delta serum phosphate ≥ 3.2 mg/dl was associated 
with in-hospital mortality and 28-day mortality in patients with sepsis.

BACKGROUND: The estimated pulse wave velocity (ePWV) is a recently developed, 
simple and useful tool to measure arterial stiffness and to predict long-term 
cardiovascular mortality. However, the association of ePWV with mortality risk 
in patients with subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH) is unclear. Herein, this study 
aims to assess the potential prediction value of ePWV on short- and long-term 
mortality of SAH patients.
METHODS: Data of adult patients with no traumatic SAH were extracted from the 
Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care (MIMIC) III and IV database in this 
retrospective cohort study. Weighted univariate and multivariable Cox regression 
analyses were used to explore the associations of ePWV levels with 30-day 
mortality and 1-year mortality in SAH patients. The evaluation indexes were 
hazard ratios (HRs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs). In addition, subgroup 
analyses of age, the sequential organ failure assessment (SOFA) score, surgery, 
atrial fibrillation (AF), renal failure (RF), hepatic diseases, chronic 
obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), sepsis, hypertension, and diabetes 
mellitus (DM) were also performed.
RESULTS: Among 1,481 eligible patients, 339 died within 30 days and 435 died 
within 1 year. After adjusting for covariates, ePWV ≥ 12.10 was associated with 
higher risk of both 30-day mortality (HR = 1.77, 95%CI: 1.17-2.67) and 1-year 
mortality (HR = 1.97, 95%CI: 1.36-2.85), compared to ePWV < 10.12. The receiver 
operator characteristic (ROC) curves showed that compared to single SOFA score, 
ePWV combined with SOFA score had a relative superior predictive performance on 
both 30-day mortality and 1-year mortality, with the area under the curves 
(AUCs) of 0.740 vs. 0.664 and 0.754 vs. 0.658. This positive relationship 
between ePWV and mortality risk was also found in age ≥ 65 years old, SOFA 
score < 2, non-surgery, non-hepatic diseases, non-COPD, non-hypertension, 
non-DM, and sepsis subgroups.
CONCLUSION: Baseline ePWV level may have potential prediction value on short- 
and long-term mortality in SAH patients. However, the application of ePWV in SAH 
prognosis needs further clarification.

AIM: Septic older adults represent a vulnerable population with high mortality 
rates. Base excess (BE), an indicator of acid-base status, may serve as a 
prognostic marker in sepsis. This study aimed to investigate the association 
between BE and mortality in septic older adults.
METHODS: A retrospective analysis included septic older adults (age ≥ 65 years) 
from the Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care (MIMIC)-IV database. The 
primary outcome was 30-day mortality. Multivariate Cox regression models and 
Kaplan-Meier analysis were used to assess the association between BE and 30-day 
mortality. A two-segment linear regression model with smooth curve fitting was 
employed to examine threshold effects of BE on clinical outcomes.
RESULTS: The study comprised 7379 participants, with a 21.8% 30-day mortality 
rate and an 18.6% in-hospital mortality rate. A nonlinear, U-shaped relationship 
(P < 0.001) was observed between BE and 30-day mortality in septic older adults, 
indicating increased risk with higher or lower BE levels. Various BE groups 
showed different hazard ratios for mortality: 2.7 (2.26-3.22), 1.86 (1.65-2.09), 
1.41 (1.19-1.67), and 1.9 (1.4-2.58), respectively, compared with the reference 
group (-3 mEq/L ≤ BE < 3 mEq/L). The inflection point was calculated as 
0.5 mEq/L.
CONCLUSIONS: Our findings suggest a U-shaped relationship between BE and 
mortality in septic older adults, emphasizing the importance of monitoring 
acid-base status in sepsis management for this population. Geriatr Gerontol Int

BACKGROUND: Sepsis has long been a life-threatening organ dysfunction. Sepsis 
associated acute kidney injury (SA-AKI) is an important complication of sepsis, 
as an important hemodynamic index, the impact of central venous pressure (CVP) 
on sepsis patients needs to be explored. Thus this study aimed to investigate 
the relationship between CVP and the mortality of SA-AKI.
METHODS: Clinical data of adult patients with sepsis-related acute kidney 
injury, defined as met both the Sepsis 3.0 criteria and the Kidney Disease 
Improving Global Outcomes Clinical Practice Guideline (KDIGO) criteria, were 
obtained from the Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care-IV (MIMIC-IV) 
database. The included cohort was divided into a high CVP and a low CVP group 
were determined based on the cuf-off value from receiver operating 
characteristic curve, with propensity score-matched analysis of the 28-day 
mortality for both groups and sensitivity analysis using inverse the 
probability-weighting model, multifactorial regression, and doubly robust 
estimation, patients acquired chronic coronary syndrome (CCS) and diabetes were 
also taken into consideration.
RESULTS: Of 1,377 patients with sepsis-related acute kidney injury, low CVP 
group (<13 mmHg) was 67.4% (n=928) and high CVP group (≥13 mmHg) was 32.6% 
(n=449). The two groups were matched 1:1 by propensity score to obtain a matched 
cohort (n=288). The mortality rates in the low versus high CVP group (19.4% vs. 
34.7%) were statistically difference (odds ratio OR: 0.454; 95% confidence 
interval 0.263, 0.771). Moreover, the bistable analysis of logistic regression 
of the matched cohort (OR: 0.434; 95% CI: 0.244, 0.757), propensity score 
inverse probability weighting (IPW) (OR: 0.547; 95% CI: 0.454, 0.658), and 
multifactorial logistic regression (OR: 0.352; 95% CI: 0.127, 0.932) all yielded 
the same results.
CONCLUSIONS: In patients with sepsis-related acute kidney injury, a lower CVP 
level (<13 mmHg) is an independent variable associated with decreased mortality. 
The threshold of CVP needs to be controlled in clinical work to improve the 
prognosis of patients with SA-AKI.

Many studies have provided significant evidence to suggest that early aggressive 
fluid resuscitation strategies are acutely beneficial in patients with sepsis. 
However, most of these studies did not follow up to determine the long-term 
impacts on patients' fluid and electrolyte balance after high-volume 
resuscitation strategies. This study sought to investigate the results of the 
aggressive fluid resuscitation measures used on patients with sepsis over the 
course of 7 days following resuscitation. An initial 3528 adult patients with 
sepsis who met inclusion criteria from the Medical Information Mart for 
Intensive Care IV database were collected. The total 7-day fluid balance of each 
patient was calculated and categorized into quartiles. Univariate Cox 
regression, lasso regression, backward stepwise elimination, and multivariate 
Cox regression were performed to search for variables related to survival during 
hospitalization. To determine the critical point of patients' fluid balance over 
7 days, a restricted cubic spline regression model with 4 knots was performed. 
In addition, an inverse probability of treatment weighting analysis was 
conducted to confirm our findings. The median 7-day fluid balance is 5321.4 
(interquartile range, 848.5-10,404.0) mL. The observed 28-day mortality in this 
cohort was 21.6%. Both before and after the inverse probability of treatment 
weighting analysis, the first 7-day fluid balance in the intensive care unit was 
significantly related to mortality during hospitalization (P < .001). A 
restricted cubic spline regression analysis indicated when the 7-day fluid 
balance was equal to 5243.3ml, the heart rate value was ≈1. A 7-day fluid 
balance < 5243.3 mL was considered a protective factor, while a 
balance > 5243.3 mL was considered a risk factor for patient mortality. To be 
clear, this study does not advocate against aggressive fluid resuscitation in 
patients with sepsis. However, clinicians walk a fine line with the extent of 
the resuscitation volume given to patients with sepsis. As a result of this 
study, it is highly advised that fluid resuscitation in patients with sepsis be 
limited to ≈5200-mL 7-day fluid balance for optimal clinical benefit.

BACKGROUND: Early prediction of hospital mortality is crucial for ICU patients 
with sepsis. This study aimed to develop a novel blending machine learning (ML) 
model for hospital mortality prediction in ICU patients with sepsis.
METHODS: Two ICU databases were employed: eICU Collaborative Research Database 
(eICU-CRD) and Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care III (MIMIC-III). All 
adult patients who fulfilled Sepsis-3 criteria were identified. Samples from 
eICU-CRD constituted training set and samples from MIMIC-III constituted test 
set. Stepwise logistic regression model was used for predictor selection. 
Blending ML model which integrated nine sorts of basic ML models was developed 
for hospital mortality prediction in ICU patients with sepsis. Model performance 
was evaluated by various measures related to discrimination or calibration.
RESULTS: Twelve thousand five hundred fifty-eight patients from eICU-CRD were 
included as the training set, and 12,095 patients from MIMIC-III were included 
as the test set. Both the training set and the test set showed a hospital 
mortality of 17.9%. Maximum and minimum lactate, maximum and minimum albumin, 
minimum PaO2/FiO2 and age were important predictors identified by both random 
forest and extreme gradient boosting algorithm. Blending ML models based on 
corresponding set of predictors presented better discrimination than SAPS II 
(AUROC, 0.806 vs. 0.771; AUPRC 0.515 vs. 0.429) and SOFA (AUROC, 0.742 vs. 
0.706; AUPRC 0.428 vs. 0.381) on the test set. In addition, calibration curves 
showed that blending ML models had better calibration than SAPS II.
CONCLUSIONS: The blending ML model is capable of integrating different sorts of 
basic ML models efficiently, and outperforms conventional severity scores in 
predicting hospital mortality among septic patients in ICU.

Background: Human serum albumin (HSA) is a commonly used medication for the 
treatment of sepsis. However, there is no conclusive evidence as to whether 
different concentrations of HSA are associated with patient prognosis. This 
study aimed to evaluate the association between different concentrations of HSA 
and 28-day mortality in patients with sepsis. Methods: The data for this 
retrospective study were collected from the Medical Information Mart for 
Intensive Care IV database. Patients with sepsis were divided into two groups 
according to the concentration of HSA received: 25% and 5% HSA. The primary 
outcome of this study was the 28-day mortality in patients with sepsis. To 
ensure the robustness of our findings, we used multivariate Cox regression, 
propensity score matching, double-robust estimation, and inverse probability 
weighting models. Results: A total of 76,943 patients were screened, of whom 
5,009 were enrolled. 1,258 and 3,751 patients received 25% and 5% HSA, 
respectively. The 28-day mortality rate was 38.2% (481/1,258) for patients in 
the 25% HSA group and 8.7% (325/3,751) for patients in the 5% HSA group. After 
propensity score matching, 1,648 patients were identified. The inverse 
probability weighting model suggested that 5% HSA received was associated with 
lower 28-day mortality (hazard ratio [HR]: 0.63, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 
0.54-0.73, p < 0.001). Subgroup and sensitivity analysis confirmed the 
robustness of the results. Conclusion: In patients with sepsis, 5% HSA received 
may be associated with a lower risk of 28-day mortality than 25% HSA. Further 
randomized controlled trials are required to confirm this association.

BACKGROUND: This study investigated the association between vasoactive 
medication exposure and mortality risk in patients with sepsis using the 
norepinephrine equivalent (NEE) score and vasoactive-inotropic score (VIS).
METHODS: This retrospective cohort study included adult patients with sepsis 
requiring vasoactive agents. The data were extracted from the Medical 
Information Mart for Intensive Care IV database. The primary outcome was 28-day 
mortality. Multivariate Cox regression was used to elucidate the relationship 
between vasoactive medication exposure and 28-day mortality, as quantified by 
the VIS and NEE score. Hazard ratios with 95% confidence intervals (CI) for 
28-day mortality were generated, and forest plots were constructed to present 
the results of univariate and multivariate analyses. The Kaplan-Meier method was 
used to analyze the cumulative incidence of 28-day mortality. A nomogram was 
constructed to predict the prognosis of patients with sepsis.
RESULTS: The present study encompassed 9,032 patients diagnosed with sepsis who 
received vasoactive therapy, of which 4,229 patients were further analyzed at 
the second hour after the onset of sepsis. Distinct variations in demographic 
data were observed between survivors (n = 3,265, 77.21%) and non-survivors 
(n = 964, 22.79%). Multivariate analysis indicated that several factors, 
including VIS >15.04 (p = 0.001), NEE >0.10 (p < 0.001), heart rate (p = 0.045), 
mean arterial pressure (p = 0.009), respiratory rate (p < 0.001), oxygen 
saturation (p < 0.001), blood urea nitrogen (BUN) (p = 0.001), and the Acute 
Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation II (p < 0.001), were significantly 
associated with 28-day mortality in the patients with sepsis. The NEE score, 
respiratory rate, oxygen saturation, and BUN were incorporated into the nomogram 
model with a concordance index of 0.779 and an area under the curve of 0.802 
(95% CI 0.787-0.818).
CONCLUSION: We found that the VIS and NEE score had favorable values for 
predicting mortality risk in patients with sepsis in the intensive care units. 
The VIS and NEE score in the second hour after sepsis onset were independently 
associated with 28-day mortality in patients with sepsis.

OBJECTIVE: This study developed and validated a stacked ensemble machine 
learning model to predict the risk of acute kidney injury in patients with acute 
pancreatitis complicated by sepsis.
DESIGN: A retrospective study based on patient data from public databases.
PARTICIPANTS: This study analysed 1295 patients with acute pancreatitis 
complicated by septicaemia from the US Intensive Care Database.
METHODS: From the MIMIC database, data of patients with acute pancreatitis and 
sepsis were obtained to construct machine learning models, which were internally 
and externally validated. The Boruta algorithm was used to select variables. 
Then, eight machine learning algorithms were used to construct prediction models 
for acute kidney injury (AKI) occurrence in intensive care unit (ICU) patients. 
A new stacked ensemble model was developed using the Stacking ensemble method. 
Model evaluation was performed using area under the receiver operating 
characteristic curve (AUC), precision-recall (PR) curve, accuracy, recall and F1 
score. The Shapley additive explanation (SHAP) method was used to explain the 
models.
MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: AKI in patients with acute pancreatitis complicated by 
sepsis.
RESULTS: The final study included 1295 patients with acute pancreatitis 
complicated by sepsis, among whom 893 cases (68.9%) developed acute kidney 
injury. We established eight base models, including Logit, SVM, CatBoost, RF, 
XGBoost, LightGBM, AdaBoost and MLP, as well as a stacked ensemble model called 
Multimodel. Among all models, Multimodel had an AUC value of 0.853 (95% CI: 
0.792 to 0.896) in the internal validation dataset and 0.802 (95% CI: 0.732 to 
0.861) in the external validation dataset. This model demonstrated the best 
predictive performance in terms of discrimination and clinical application.
CONCLUSION: The stack ensemble model developed by us achieved AUC values of 
0.853 and 0.802 in internal and external validation cohorts respectively and 
also demonstrated excellent performance in other metrics. It serves as a 
reliable tool for predicting AKI in patients with acute pancreatitis complicated 
by sepsis.

This study aimed to investigate the time-related association between cumulative 
fluid balance (FB) and mortality. Data were extracted from the Medical 
Information Mart for Intensive Care (MIMIC) III. FB data on 8584 patients at the 
first (FB-fir24hr) and second (FB-sec24hr) 24 hours after intensive care unit 
admission were analysed. Compared to the combination of FB-fir24hr ≤ 0 and 
FB-sec24 hr ≤ 0, the combination of FB-fir24hr > 0 and FB-sec24hr ≤ 0 had 
significantly higher FB, with an insignificant odds ratio (OR) for mortality. 
However, the mortality ORs of two other combinations (FB-fir24hr ≤ 0 and 
FB-sec24hr > 0; FB-fir24hr > 0 and FB-sec24hr > 0) were significantly high. 
Furthermore, multivariable logistic analysis showed a significant stepwise 
increase ORs for mortality with increasing FB-sec24hr quartiles, with no 
significant increase in FB-fir24hr quartiles aside from quartile 4. In patients 
with negative FB, a stepwise decrease in mortality ORs with increasing 
FB-sec24hr quartiles was found with no significant difference in FB-fir24hr 
quartiles. In conclusion, the positive FB during the second but not the first 
24 hours was associated with increased mortality in sepsis. Achieving more 
negative FB was associated with decreased mortality only in the second 24 hours.

INTRODUCTION: Imbalances in blood potassium (K) homeostasis is a significant 
contributor to the emergence of severe complications, especially among 
critically ill patients. Hypokalemia and hyperkalemia are both associated with 
an increased risk of adverse events. However, it is not known about the impact 
of blood K levels on risk of intensive care units (ICU) mortality for Acute 
kidney injury (AKI) combined with sepsis patients. This study aimed to explore 
the relationship between admission blood K levels and ICU 30-day mortality in 
patients with AKI combined with sepsis.
METHODS: We selected patients diagnosed with AKI and sepsis on their first ICU 
admission from the Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care IV (MIMIC-IV) 
database. The first blood K levels within 24 hours of admission were categorized 
into three groups according to tertiles (T1 < 3.9 mmol/L, 3.9 ≤ T2 < 4.5 mmol/L, 
and T3 ≥ 4.5 mmol/L), with T2 serving as the reference. We examined the 
association between blood K levels and ICU 30-day mortality using accelerated 
failure time (AFT) models and survival analysis.
RESULTS: A total of 8,242 ICU patients with AKI combined with sepsis were 
included. In multivariate AFT models, each 1 mmol/L increase in blood K levels 
was associated with a 13% increase in the risk of ICU 30-day mortality (p < 
0.001, 95% confidence interval (CI): 1.06-1.20). Extended multivariable AFT 
models showed that, compared to the middle category, patients with high blood K 
levels (≥ 4.5 mmol/L) were associated with all-cause mortality (p = 0.002, 
adjusted hazard ratio (HR) = 1.22, 95% CI: 1.08-1.38), whereas those with low 
blood K levels (< 3.9 mmol/L) showed no significant difference (p = 0.385, 
adjusted HR = 1.06, 95% CI: 0.93-1.21). Kaplan-Meier curves indicated that 
patients with high blood K levels had higher mortality, and those with middle 
blood potassium levels (3.9 ≤ K < 4.5 mmol/L) had the lowest mortality.
CONCLUSION: The admission baseline blood K levels were significantly associated 
with ICU 30-day mortality in intensive care patients suffering from AKI in 
conjunction with sepsis. Therefore, immediate and careful correction of blood 
potassium imbalances may prove to be a crucial approach in improving outcomes 
for these patients.

BACKGROUND: This study aimed to explore the association between the stress 
hyperglycemia ratio (SHR) and short- and long-term outcomes in critically ill 
patients with sepsis.
METHODS: This retrospective observational cohort study was conducted using the 
Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care-IV (MIMIC-IV v2.2) database. 
Patients were categorized into 4 SHR quartiles. The main focus was on 
in-hospital mortality and 1-year all-cause mortality as primary endpoints, while 
intensive care unit and hospital stays were considered as secondary outcomes. 
Regression and subgroup analyses were used to assess the correlation between SHR 
and the primary and secondary outcomes. Restricted cubic spline analysis was 
utilized to explore the nonlinear relationships between SHR and in-hospital and 
1-year all-cause mortality.
RESULTS: This study included two groups of patients, comprising 7456 and 6564 
individuals. The in-hospital and 1-year mortality was 11.96% and 17.96% in 
Cohort 1 and 2, respectively. SHR was associated with an elevated risk of 
in-hospital mortality (OR: 2.08, 95%CI 1.66-2.61) and 1-year mortality (HR: 
1.70, 95% CI 1.42-2.04). Patients in SHR quartile 4 had a higher risk of 
in-hospital (OR: 1.86, 95% CI 1.51-2.30) and 1-year (HR: 1.44, 95% CI 1.23-1.69) 
mortality than those in quartile 2. Restricted cubic spline analysis showed a 
"J-shaped" relationship between SHR and all-cause mortality in both cohorts. The 
relationship between high SHR and mortality remained consistent across almost 
all predefined subgroups.
CONCLUSIONS: Our study suggests that high SHR is associated with increased 
in-hospital and 1-year mortality in critically ill sepsis patients. Further 
investigations are needed to validate these results.

BACKGROUND: Atrial fibrillation (AF) is the most common arrhythmia during 
critical illness, representing a sepsis-defining cardiac dysfunction associated 
with adverse outcomes. Large burdens of premature beats and noisy signal during 
sepsis may pose unique challenges to automated AF detection.
OBJECTIVE: The objective of this study is to develop and validate an automated 
algorithm to accurately identify AF within electronic health care data among 
critically ill patients with sepsis.
METHODS: This is a retrospective cohort study of patients hospitalized with 
sepsis identified from Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care (MIMIC III) 
electronic health data with linked electrocardiographic (ECG) telemetry 
waveforms. Within 3 separate cohorts of 50 patients, we iteratively developed 
and validated an automated algorithm that identifies ECG signals, removes noise, 
and identifies irregular rhythm and premature beats in order to identify AF. We 
compared the automated algorithm to current methods of AF identification in 
large databases, including ICD-9 (International Classification of Diseases, 9th 
edition) codes and hourly nurse annotation of heart rhythm. Methods of AF 
identification were tested against gold-standard manual ECG review.
RESULTS: AF detection algorithms that did not differentiate AF from premature 
atrial and ventricular beats performed modestly, with 76% (95% CI 61%-87%) 
accuracy. Performance improved (P=.02) with the addition of premature beat 
detection (validation set accuracy: 94% [95% CI 83%-99%]). Median time between 
automated and manual detection of AF onset was 30 minutes (25th-75th percentile 
0-208 minutes). The accuracy of ICD-9 codes (68%; P=.002 vs automated algorithm) 
and nurse charting (80%; P=.02 vs algorithm) was lower than that of the 
automated algorithm.
CONCLUSIONS: An automated algorithm using telemetry ECG data can feasibly and 
accurately detect AF among critically ill patients with sepsis, and represents 
an improvement in AF detection within large databases.

OBJECTIVE: To identify factors associated with outcome of septic shock patients 
receiving high dose noradrenaline according to three primary infection sites.
METHODS: This retrospective study was based on data from a publicly available 
ICU database (Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care [MIMIC] III. Septic 
shock patients receiving high dose (≥1 μg/kg per min) noradrenaline and ≥18 
years were identified and their characteristics and outcomes were compared 
according to three primary infection sites (abdominal, respiratory and urinary 
tract).
RESULTS: 154 septic shock patients who received high doses of noradrenaline were 
identified; (89 [58%] had a respiratory infection, 41 [27%] an abdominal 
infection and 24 [16%] a urinary infection). There were no differences among the 
three infection groups in duration/maximum dosage of noradrenaline, length of 
stay in the ICU/hospital, do not resuscitate (DNR) rates, hypertension and 
adequate antimicrobial therapy. Patients with urinary infections had a lower 
risk of death at 28-days compared with those with abdominal or respiratory 
infections.
CONCLUSIONS: The prognosis for septic shock patients receiving high dose 
noradrenaline is poor. Patients with abdominal or respiratory infections are at 
higher risk of death compared with those with urinary infections.

BACKGROUND: We determined utilizing a sepsis participant cohort whether there is 
a significant association between TyG-BMI (triglyceride glucose body mass index) 
and mortality rates at any stage.
METHODS: Herein, a historical cohort investigation approach was adopted, using 
information provided by the Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care-IV 
(MIMIC-IV). We categorized the included individuals in accordance with their 
TyG-BMI data quartiles, and the primary outcomes were mortality during the 
hospital stay and death rate due to any reason at postadmission day 28, 90, and 
365. To evaluate TyG-BMI mortality's relationship with sepsis-induced mortality 
risk, we employed restricted cubic spline regression (RCS) and Cox regression 
models. Additionally, we confirmed TyG-BMI's significant predictive value for 
mortality via machine learning methods. Furthermore, we performed subgroup 
analyses to investigate possible differences among various patient groups.
RESULTS: The cohort included 4759 individuals, aged 63.9 ± 15.0 years, involving 
2885 males (60.6%). The rates of death that took place during hospital stay and 
at 28, 90 and 365 days postadmission were respectively 19.60%, 24.70%, 28.80%, 
and 35.20%. As reflected by Cox models, TyG-BMI was negatively associated with 
mortality risk at various intervals: in-hospital [hazard ratio (HR) 0.47 
(0.39-0.56), P = 0.003], 28 days postadmission [HR 0.42 (0.35-0.49), P < 0.001], 
90 days postadmission [HR 0.41 (0.35-0.48), P < 0.001], and 365 days 
postadmission [HR 0.41 (0.35-0.47), P < 0.001]. Additionally, the relationship 
between TyG-BMI and death rates was L-shaped, as reflected by the RCS, with a 
TyG-BMI of 249 being the turning point.
CONCLUSIONS: Among sepsis patients in critical care, TyG-BMI is negatively 
correlated with mortality possibility at various intervals: during hospital stay 
and 28 days, 90 days, and one year postadmission. TyG-BMI is a beneficial 
parameter for categorizing risk levels among sepsis patients and for predicting 
their mortality risk within one year.

BACKGROUND: The incidence and mortality of severe Gram-positive cocci infections 
are particularly high in intensive care units (ICUs). Vancomycin remains the 
treatment of choice for severe infections caused by Gram-positive cocci, 
particularly methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA). Some guidelines 
recommend therapeutic drug monitoring (TDM) for critically ill patients treated 
with vancomycin; however, there is currently a lack of evidence to support that 
TDM improves the mortality rates of these patients. Therefore, we designed this 
cohort study to compare the impact of monitoring vancomycin blood concentrations 
on mortality rates in critically ill patients and to provide evidence to support 
this routine clinical practice.
METHODS: Data were extracted from the Medical Information Mart for Intensive 
Care (MIMIC)-IV database for a retrospective cohort analysis of critically ill 
patients receiving intravenous vancomycin treatment. The primary outcome was the 
28 day mortality rate. The propensity score matching (PSM) method was used to 
match the baseline characteristics between patients in the TDM group and the 
non-TDM group. The relationship between 28 day mortality and vancomycin TDM in 
the critically ill cohort was evaluated using Cox proportional hazards 
regression analysis and Kaplan-Meier survival curves. Validation of the primary 
outcomes was conducted by comparing the PSM model and the Cox proportional 
hazards regression model. The robustness of the conclusion was subsequently 
verified by subgroup and sensitivity analyses.
RESULTS: Data for 18,056 critically ill patients who met the study criteria were 
collected from the MIMIC-IV database. Of these, 7,451 patients had at least one 
record of vancomycin blood concentration monitoring, which we defined as the TDM 
group. The TDM group exhibited a 28 day mortality rate of 25.7% (1,912/7,451) 
compared to 16.2% in the non-TDM group (1,723/10,605). After PSM, 4,264 patients 
were included in each of the TDM and non-TDM groups, with a 28 day mortality 
rate of 20.0% (1,022/4,264) in the TDM group and 26.4% (1,126/4,264) in the 
non-TDM group. Multivariate Cox proportional hazards analysis revealed a 
significantly lower 28 day mortality risk in the TDM group when compared to the 
non-TDM group (adjusted hazard ratio [HR]: 0.86; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 
0.79, 0.93; p < 0.001). Further PSM analyses (adjusted HR: 0.91; 95% CI: 0.84, 
0.99; p = 0.033) confirmed the lower risk of mortality in the TDM group. 
Kaplan-Meier survival analysis revealed a significantly higher survival rate at 
28 days for the TDM group (log-rank test, p < 0.001). Subgroup analysis results 
indicated that patients with sepsis, septic shock, estimated glomerular 
filtration rate ≤ 60 mL/min/1.73 m2, undergoing renal replacement therapy, using 
vasoactive drugs, on mechanical ventilation, and those with higher severity 
scores (Acute Physiology Score III ≥40, Oxford Acute Severity of Illness Score 
≥30, Simplified Acute Physiology Score II ≥ 30) significantly benefited from 
monitoring vancomycin blood concentrations. The results remained unchanged 
excluding patients staying in ICU for less than 48 h or those infected with 
MRSA.
CONCLUSION: This cohort study showed that monitoring vancomycin blood 
concentrations is associated with a significantly lower 28 day mortality rate in 
critically ill patients, highlighting the importance of routinely performing 
vancomycin TDM in these patients.

OBJECTIVES: Our previous study shows that serum ammonia in sepsis patients 
without hepatic failure is associated with a poor prognosis. The relationship 
between serum ammonia level and the prognosis of sepsis-associated 
encephalopathy (SAE) patients without hepatic failure remains unclear. We aimed 
to explore the relationship between serum ammonia levels and the prognosis of 
patients with SAE.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: This study is a retrospective cohort study. We collected 
465 patients with SAE admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) from Medical 
Information Mart for Intensive Care IV (MIMIC IV) from 2008 to 2019. Patients 
with SAE were divided into a survival group (369 patients) and a non-survival 
group (96 patients). We used the Wilcoxon signed-rank test and the multivariate 
logistic regression analysis to analyze the relationship between serum ammonia 
levels and the prognosis of patients with SAE. R software was used to analyze 
the dataset.
RESULTS: The primary outcome was the relationship between serum ammonia level 
and hospital mortality of SAE. The secondary outcomes were the relationship 
between serum ammonia level and hospital stays, simplified acute physiology 
score (SAPS II), Charlson, Glasgow coma scale (GCS), sequential organ failure 
assessment (SOFA), and lactate level of SAE. The mortality of patients with SAE 
was 20.6%. The serum ammonia level was not significantly associated with 
hospital mortality, longer hospital stays, higher SAPS II and Charlson scores, 
and lower GCS of patients with SAE. The serum ammonia level was associated with 
higher SOFA scores and lactate levels in patients with SAE. The SAPS II and 
Charlson scores were independent risk factors for death in patients with SAE.
CONCLUSION: Serum ammonia level was associated with higher SOFA scores and 
lactate levels in patients with SAE. In addition, the SAPS II and Charlson 
scores can be used to assess the prognosis of patients with SAE. Therefore, we 
should closely monitor serum ammonia, SAPS II, and Charlson levels in patients 
with SAE.

BACKGROUND: Sepsis-associated liver injury (SALI) is associated with poor 
outcomes and increased mortality. However, effectively stratifying SALI patients 
according to prognosis remains challenging. This study evaluates 
laboratory-based clustering filters for stratifying SALI patients by 30-day 
mortality risk, utilizing data mining techniques for novel pattern discovery.
METHODS: This retrospective cohort study analyzed SALI patients from two ICU 
databases: Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care (MIMIC)-IV database 
(n = 73,181, study period: 2008 to 2019) and Amsterdam UMC (n = 16,194, study 
period: 2003 to 2016). Patients were identified using Sepsis-3 criteria and 
liver injury markers. Risk stratification employed three laboratory-based 
approaches: (I) De Ritis ratio (aspartate aminotransferase/alanine 
aminotransferase), (II) R-factor (alanine aminotransferase and alkaline 
phosphatase relative to their upper limits of normal), and (III) alanine 
aminotransferase elevation. Kaplan-Meier analysis and multivariable Cox 
regression assessed the association between stratification methods and 30-day 
mortality risk.
FINDINGS: SALI patients had almost a 2-fold higher risk of 30-day mortality than 
those without SALI (hazard ratio: 1.73; 95%-CI: 1.58-1.90, p < 0.0001). Each 
stratification method (I-III) successfully classified patients into 
statistically distinct risk strata. The De Ritis ratio emerged as the strongest 
prognostic differentiation method: a ratio ≤1 indicated no significant increase 
in mortality risk (hazard ratio: 0.86; 95%-CI: 0.68-1.09, p = 0.21), whereas 
ratios of 1-2 and ≥2 were significantly associated with higher mortality (hazard 
ratio: 1.56; 95%-CI: 1.37-1.78, p < 0.0001 and hazard ratio: 2.46; 95%-CI: 
2.18-2.77, p < 0.0001, respectively). All findings were confirmed in the 
validation cohort.
INTERPRETATION: The De Ritis ratio serves as a valuable prognostic tool for 
30-day mortality in SALI patients. Our findings indicate that patients with a 
ratio ≥1 face significantly worse outcomes, highlighting the need for targeted 
interventions. These results refine risk stratification in SALI subphenotypes, 
enhancing our understanding of its prognostic implications.
FUNDING: This study received no external funding and was solely financed through 
the departmental resources of the authors.

BACKGROUND: This study evaluates the impact of different initial ventilation 
strategies on in-hospital mortality among sepsis patients.
METHODS: We included hospitalized sepsis patients who underwent mechanical 
ventilation from the Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care IV (MIMIC-IV) 
database and categorized them into groups based on their initial ventilation 
strategy: non-invasive ventilation (NIV) and invasive mechanical ventilation 
(IMV). The main endpoint analyzed was in-hospital mortality. A propensity score 
matching model was employed to address confounding factors, and Cox survival 
analysis was performed in the matched cohort. Subgroup analyses were conducted 
to evaluate population heterogeneity.
RESULTS: Among 19,796 patients who received mechanical ventilation, 10,073 
(50.8%) initially received NIV. The analysis included 2935 matched pairs. 
Patients initially receiving NIV exhibited a higher survival rate (P = 0.009) 
and a 24% lower risk of in-hospital mortality compared to those initially 
receiving IMV (P < 0.001). Subgroup analysis indicated significant survival 
benefits with initial NIV for patients without malignant tumor (MT), or lower 
Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (SOFA) scores and higher PO2/FiO2.
CONCLUSION: Among sepsis patients, initial NIV is linked to increased 
in-hospital survival rates and reduced mortality risk, particularly in patients 
without concurrent MT, lower SOFA scores, and higher PO2/FiO2.

The Surviving Sepsis Campaign Guidelines 2021 recommends that adult patients 
with sepsis requiring intensive care should be admitted to the ICU within 6 
hours of their emergency department (ED) visits. However, there is limited 
evidence on whether 6 hours is the best target time for compliance with the 
sepsis bundle. We aimed to investigate the association between time from ED 
visits to ICU admission (i.e., ED length of stay [ED-LOS]) and mortality and 
identify the optimal ED-LOS for patients with sepsis.
DESIGN: Retrospective cohort study.
SETTING: The Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care Emergency Department 
and Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care IV databases.
PATIENTS: Adult patients (≥ 18 yr old) who were transferred from the ED to the 
ICU and subsequently diagnosed with sepsis based on the Sepsis-3 criteria within 
24 hours of ICU admission.
INTERVENTIONS: None.
MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Among 1,849 patients with sepsis, we found a 
disproportionally higher mortality rate in patients immediately admitted to the 
ICU (e.g., < 2 hr). When using ED-LOS as a continuous variable, ED-LOS was not 
significantly associated with 28-day mortality (adjusted odds ratio [OR] per 
hour increase, 1.04; 95% CI, 0.96-1.13; p = 0.3) after an adjustment for 
potential confounders (e.g., demographics, triage vital signs, and laboratory 
results) in the multivariable analysis. However, when we categorized all 
patients into time quartiles (ED-LOS: < 3.3 hr, 3.3-4.5 hr, 4.6-6.1 hr, and > 
6.1 hr), patients in the higher time quartiles (e.g., 3.3-4.5 hr) had higher 
28-day mortality compared with those in the lowest time quartile (< 3.3 hr) 
(e.g., adjusted OR for patients in the second time quartile [3.3-4.5 hr] 1.59; 
95% CI, 1.03-2.46; p = 0.04).
CONCLUSIONS: Earlier admission to the ICU (e.g., within 3.3 hr of ED visits) was 
associated with lower 28-day mortality in patients with sepsis. Our findings 
suggest patients with sepsis who require intensive care may benefit from a more 
immediate ICU admission than 6 hours.

BACKGROUND: People with traumatic brain injury (TBI) are at high risk for 
infection and sepsis. The aim of the study was to develop and validate an 
explainable machine learning(ML) model based on clinical features for early 
prediction of the risk of sepsis in TBI patients.
METHODS: We enrolled all patients with TBI in the Medical Information Mart for 
Intensive Care IV database from 2008 to 2019. All patients were randomly divided 
into a training set (70%) and a test set (30%). The univariate and multivariate 
regression analyses were used for feature selection. Six ML methods were applied 
to develop the model. The predictive performance of different models were 
determined based on the area under the curve (AUC) and calibration curves in the 
test cohort. In addition, we selected the eICU Collaborative Research Database 
version 1.2 as the external validation dataset. Finally, we used the Shapley 
additive interpretation to account for the effects of features attributed to the 
model.
RESULTS: Of the 1555 patients enrolled in the final cohort, 834 (53.6%) patients 
developed sepsis after TBI. Six variables were associated with concomitant 
sepsis and were used to develop ML models. Of the 6 models constructed, the 
Extreme Gradient Boosting (XGB) model achieved the best performance with an AUC 
of 0.807 and an accuracy of 74.5% in the internal validation cohort, and an AUC 
of 0.762 for the external validation. Feature importance analysis revealed that 
use mechanical ventilation, SAPSII score, use intravenous pressors, blood 
transfusion on admission, history of diabetes, and presence of post-stroke 
sequelae were the top six most influential features of the XGB model.
CONCLUSION: As shown in the study, the ML model could be used to predict the 
occurrence of sepsis in patients with TBI in the intensive care unit.

INTRODUCTION: Sepsis is associated to a high mortality rate, and its severity 
must be evaluated quickly. The severity of illness scores used are intended to 
be applicable to all patient populations, and generally evaluate in-hospital 
mortality. However, patients with sepsis continue to be at risk of death after 
hospital discharge.
OBJECTIVE: To develop a model for predicting 1-year mortality in critical 
patients diagnosed with sepsis.
PATIENTS: The data corresponding to 5650 admissions of patients with sepsis from 
the Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care (MIMIC-III) database were 
evaluated, randomly divided as follows: 70% for training and 30% for validation.
DESIGN: A retrospective register-based cohort study was carried out. The 
clinical information of the first 24h after admission was used to develop a 
1-year mortality prediction model based on Stochastic Gradient Boosting (SGB) 
methodology. Variable selection was addressed using Least Absolute Shrinkage and 
Selection Operator (LASSO) and SGB variable importance methodologies. The 
predictive power was evaluated using the area under the ROC curve (AUROC).
RESULTS: An AUROC of 0.8039 (95% confidence interval (CI): [0.8033 0.8045]) was 
obtained in the validation subset. The model exceeded the predictive 
performances obtained with traditional severity of disease scores in the same 
subset.
CONCLUSION: The use of assembly algorithms, such as SGB, for the generation of a 
customized model for sepsis yields more accurate 1-year mortality prediction 
than the traditional scoring systems such as SAPS II, SOFA or OASIS.

OBJECTIVE: To examine the characteristics and risk factors associated with 
30-day readmissions, including the impact of home health care (HHC), among older 
sepsis survivors transitioning from hospital to home.
RESEARCH DESIGN: Retrospective cohort study of the Medical Information Mart for 
Intensive Care (MIMIC)-IV data (2008-2019), using generalized estimating 
equations (GEE) models adjusting for patient sociodemographic and clinical 
characteristics.
SUBJECTS: Sepsis admission episodes with in-hospital stays, aged over 65, and 
discharged home with or without HHC were included.
MEASURES: The outcome was all-cause hospital readmission within 30 days 
following sepsis hospitalization. Covariates, including the primary predictor 
(HHC vs. Home discharges), were collected during hospital stays.
RESULTS: Among 9115 sepsis admissions involving 6822 patients discharged home 
(66.8% HHC, 33.2% Home), HHC patients, compared with those discharged without 
services, were older, had more comorbidities, longer hospital stays, more prior 
hospitalizations, more intensive care unit admissions, and higher rates of 
septic shock diagnoses. Despite higher illness severity in the HHC discharges, 
both groups had high 30-day readmission rates (30.2% HHC, 25.2% Home). GEE 
analyses revealed 14% higher odds of 30-day readmission for HHC discharges after 
adjusting for risk factors (aOR: 1.14; 95% CI: 1.02-1.27; P=0.02).
CONCLUSIONS: HHC discharges experienced higher 30-day readmission rates than 
those without, indicating the need for specialized care in HHC settings for 
sepsis survivors due to their complex health care needs. Attention to sepsis 
survivors, regardless of HHC receipt, is crucial given the high readmission 
rates in both groups. Further research is needed to optimize postacute 
care/interventions for older sepsis survivors.

BACKGROUND: The efficacy of dexmedetomidine (DEX) in treating sepsis-induced 
myocardial injury (SIMI) remains unclear. In this study, we explored the 
relationship between DEX use and clinical outcomes of patients with SIMI, 
focusing on the dosage and treatment duration.
METHODS: In this retrospective cohort analysis, we identified patients with SIMI 
from the Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care IV (MIMIC-IV) database and 
categorized them into the DEX and non-DEX groups based on intensive care unit 
treatment. The baseline bias was reduced through propensity score matching 
(PSM). The primary outcome was 28-day mortality, whereas the secondary outcomes 
were in-hospital mortality and mortality rates at 7 days, 90 days, and 1 year. 
The association between DEX use and in-hospital mortality was assessed using 
Kaplan-Meier analysis and Cox proportional hazards models.
RESULTS: After PSM, 373 patients in the DEX group were matched with 579 patients 
in the non-DEX group to achieve a balanced distribution of the covariates. The 
Cox regression model demonstrated a significant reduction in the 28-day 
mortality associated with DEX use, yielding a hazard ratio (HR) of 0.61 (95% 
confidence interval [CI]: 0.47-0.78, P < 0.001). In-hospital mortality also 
significantly decreased (HR = 0.43, 95% CI: 0.33-0.57, P < 0.001). Lower 
mortality rates were observed at 7 days, 90 days, and 1 year. DEX doses 
>0.4 μg/kg/h, particularly in the range of 0.400-0.612 μg/kg/h, total doses 
>3.113 mg during hospitalization, and treatment durations exceeding 72 h were 
associated with improved mortality risk at all intervals. Regarding DEX efficacy 
at 28 days, our subgroup analyses indicated a significant interaction between 
the Sequential Organ Failure Assessment score and invasive mechanical 
ventilation.
CONCLUSION: DEX administration was associated with improved in-hospital 
mortality and reduced mortality rates at 7 days, 28 days, 90 days, and 1 year in 
patients with SIMI. These findings require validation in future studies.

BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Sepsis-associated AKI is a heterogeneous clinical 
entity. We aimed to agnostically identify sepsis-associated AKI subphenotypes 
using deep learning on routinely collected data in electronic health records.
DESIGN, SETTING, PARTICIPANTS, & MEASUREMENTS: We used the Medical Information 
Mart for Intensive Care III database, which consists of electronic health record 
data from intensive care units in a tertiary care hospital in the United States. 
We included patients ≥18 years with sepsis who developed AKI within 48 hours of 
intensive care unit admission. We then used deep learning to utilize all 
available vital signs, laboratory measurements, and comorbidities to identify 
subphenotypes. Outcomes were mortality 28 days after AKI and dialysis 
requirement.
RESULTS: We identified 4001 patients with sepsis-associated AKI. We utilized 
2546 combined features for K-means clustering, identifying three subphenotypes. 
Subphenotype 1 had 1443 patients, and subphenotype 2 had 1898 patients, whereas 
subphenotype 3 had 660 patients. Subphenotype 1 had the lowest proportion of 
liver disease and lowest Simplified Acute Physiology Score II scores compared 
with subphenotypes 2 and 3. The proportions of patients with CKD were similar 
between subphenotypes 1 and 3 (15%) but highest in subphenotype 2 (21%). 
Subphenotype 1 had lower median bilirubin levels, aspartate aminotransferase, 
and alanine aminotransferase compared with subphenotypes 2 and 3. Patients in 
subphenotype 1 also had lower median lactate, lactate dehydrogenase, and white 
blood cell count than patients in subphenotypes 2 and 3. Subphenotype 1 also had 
lower creatinine and BUN than subphenotypes 2 and 3. Dialysis requirement was 
lowest in subphenotype 1 (4% versus 7% [subphenotype 2] versus 26% [subphenotype 
3]). The mortality 28 days after AKI was lowest in subphenotype 1 (23% versus 
35% [subphenotype 2] versus 49% [subphenotype 3]). After adjustment, the 
adjusted odds ratio for mortality for subphenotype 3, with subphenotype 1 as a 
reference, was 1.9 (95% confidence interval, 1.5 to 2.4).
CONCLUSIONS: Utilizing routinely collected laboratory variables, vital signs, 
and comorbidities, we were able to identify three distinct subphenotypes of 
sepsis-associated AKI with differing outcomes.

BACKGROUND: Sepsis is an important public health issue, and it is urgent to 
develop valuable indicators to predict the prognosis of sepsis. Our study aims 
to assess the predictive value of ICU admission (Neutrophil + 
Monocyte)/lymphocyte ratio (NMLR) on the 30-day mortality of sepsis patients.
METHODS: A retrospective analysis was conducted in septic patients, and the data 
were collected from Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care IV (MIMIC-IV). 
Univariate and multivariate Cox regression analyses were conducted to 
investigate the relation between ICU admission NMLR and 30-day mortality. 
Restricted cubic spline (RCS) was performed to determine the optimum cut-off 
value of ICU admission NMLR. Survival outcomes of the two groups with different 
ICU admission NMLR levels were estimated using the Kaplan-Meier method and 
compared by the log-rank test.
RESULTS: Finally, 7292 patients were recruited in the study, of which 1601 died 
within 30 days of discharge. The non-survival group had higher ICU admission 
NMLR values than patients in the survival group (12.24 [6.44-23.67] vs. 8.71 
[4.81-16.26], P < 0.001). Univariate and multivariate Cox regression analysis 
demonstrated that ICU admission NMLR was an independent prognostic predictor on 
30-day mortality (Univariate: P < 0.001; multivariate: P=0.011). The RCS model 
demonstrated the upturn and non-linear relationship between ICU admission NMLR 
and 30-day mortality (Nonlinearity: P=0.0124). According to the KM curve 
analysis,30-day survival was worse in the higher ICU admission NMLR group than 
that in the lower ICU admission NMLR group (Log rank test, P<0.0001).
CONCLUSION: The elevated ICU admission NMLR level is an independent risk factor 
for high 30-day mortality in patients with sepsis.

BACKGROUND: Although the measurement of central venous pressure (CVP) is a 
common clinical tool, the role of CVP monitoring in the outcome of sepsis is 
controversial because threshold values of CVP are uncertain, and there are only 
limited data on short-term survival of patients with septic acute kidney injury 
(AKI).
METHODS: This retrospective cohort study was based on the Medical Information 
Mart for Intensive Care IV (MIMIC-IV) database (source of the training dataset). 
Multivariate regression analysis was performed to clarify the relation between 
CVP measurement and clinical outcomes, and a univariate regression model after 
propensity score matching was utilized to validate our findings. A mortality 
prediction model for septic AKI and a risk stratification scoring approach were 
developed, and the emergency intensive care unit (eICU) database was used for 
external validation.
RESULTS: Of the 9170 patients in the training set, 2446 (26.7%) underwent CVP 
measurement. No significant association was found between CVP monitoring and 
28-day mortality among patients with septic AKI (odds ratio = 0.479; 95% 
confidence interval 0.213-1.076, P = 0.075), even after adjustments (propensity 
score matching; P = 0.178). Length of ICU stay and hospital stay was markedly 
reduced in patients undergoing CVP measurement within 3 hours (median 6.2 and 
10.9 days, respectively, P < 0.001). The addition of the mean perfusion pressure 
initial, CVP, and the magnitude of the CVP change within 48 hours to the model 
significantly increased model discrimination (area under the receiver operating 
characteristic curve: 0.867 and 0.780, respectively, P < 0.001).
CONCLUSIONS: These findings suggest that CVP measurement alone has little effect 
on the outcome of septic AKI. Nonetheless, initial CVP levels and the dynamic 
changes in CVP within the first 48 hours after ICU admission and the mean 
perfusion pressure initial can improve the accuracy of outcome prediction 
models.

Background: Previous studies documented that heparin can inhibit the invasion 
and metastasis of tumors, but its role on outcomes in patients with solid 
malignancy complicated sepsis remains unclear. Methods: A retrospective cohort 
study was conducted in critically ill patients with solid malignancy associated 
sepsis from the Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care (MIMIC)-IV database. 
The primary endpoint was intensive care unit (ICU) mortality, secondary outcomes 
were thrombosis and hospital mortality. Propensity score matching (PSM), 
marginal structural Cox model (MSCM), cox proportional hazards model, 
stratification analysis and E-value were used to account for baseline 
differences, time-varying confounding and unmeasured variables. Results: A total 
of 1,512 patients with solid malignancy complicated sepsis were enrolled, of 
which 683 in the heparin group with intensive care unit mortality, thrombosis 
rate and hospital mortality were 9.7%, 5.4%, 16.1%, and 829 in the non-heparin 
group with ICU mortality, thrombosis rate and hospital mortality were 14.6%, 
12.5%, 22.6%. Similar results were observed on outcomes for patients with PSM 
(ICU mortality hazard ratio [HR] 0.61, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.41-0.92), 
thrombosis rate (HR 0.42, 95% confidence interval 0.26-0.68); hospital mortality 
HR 0.70, 95% CI 0.50-0.99). marginal structural Cox model further reinforced the 
efficacy of heparin in reducing ICU mortality (HR 0.48, 95% CI 0.34-0.68). 
Logistic regression and Cox regression model showed heparin use also markedly 
reduced thrombosis (HR 0.42; 95% CI 0.26-0.68; p < 0.001) and hospital mortality 
(HR 0.70; 95% CI 0.50-0.99; p = 0.043). Stratification analysis with the MSCM 
showed an effect only those with digestive system cancer (HR 0.33, 95% CI 
0.16-0.69). Conclusion: Early heparin therapy improved outcomes in critically 
ill patients with solid malignancy complicated sepsis. These results are evident 
especially in those with digestive system cancer. A prospective randomized 
controlled study should be designed to further assess the relevant findings.

BACKGROUND: Early prognosis evaluation is crucial for decision-making in 
cardiogenic shock (CS) patients. Dynamic lactate assessment, for example, 
normalized lactate load, has been a better prognosis predictor than single 
lactate value in septic shock. Our objective was to investigate the correlation 
between normalized lactate load and in-hospital mortality in patients with CS.
METHODS: Data were extracted from the Medical Information Mart for Intensive 
Care (MIMIC)-IV database. The calculation of lactate load involved the 
determination of the cumulative area under the lactate curve, while normalized 
lactate load was computed by dividing the lactate load by the corresponding 
period. Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) curves were constructed, and the 
evaluation of areas under the curves (AUC) for various parameters was performed 
using the DeLong test.
RESULTS: Our study involved a cohort of 1932 CS patients, with 687 individuals 
(36.1%) experiencing mortality during their hospitalization. The AUC for 
normalized lactate load demonstrated significant superiority compared to the 
first lactate (0.675 vs. 0.646, P < 0.001), maximum lactate (0.675 vs. 0.651, 
P < 0.001), and mean lactate (0.675 vs. 0.669, P = 0.003). Notably, the AUC for 
normalized lactate load showed comparability to that of the Sequential Organ 
Failure Assessment (SOFA) score (0.675 vs. 0.695, P = 0.175).
CONCLUSION: The normalized lactate load was an independently associated with the 
in-hospital mortality among CS patients.

BACKGROUND: Severe acute pancreatitis (SAP) can cause various complications. 
Septic shock is a relatively common and serious complication that causes 
uncontrolled systemic inflammatory response syndrome, which is one of the main 
causes of death. This study aimed to develop a nomogram for predicting the 
overall survival of SAP patients during the initial 24 hours following 
admission.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: All the data utilized in this study were obtained from 
the MIMIC-III (Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care III) database. The 
data were analyzed using multivariate Cox regression, and the performance of the 
proposed nomogram was evaluated based on Harrell's concordance index (C-index) 
and the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC). The 
clinical value of the prediction model was tested using decision-curve analysis 
(DCA). The primary outcomes were 28-day, 60-day, and 90-day mortality rates.
RESULTS: The 850 patients included in the analysis comprised 595 in the training 
cohort and 255 in the validation cohort. The training cohort consisted of 353 
(59.3%) males and 242 (40.7%) females with SAP. Multivariate Cox regression 
showed that weight, sex, insurance status, explicit sepsis, SAPSII score, 
Elixhauser score, bilirubin, anion gap, creatinine, hematocrit, hemoglobin, RDW, 
SPO2, and respiratory rate were independent prognostic factors for the survival 
of SAP patients admitted to an intensive care unit. The predicted values were 
compared using C-indexes, calibration plots, integrated discrimination 
improvement, net reclassification improvement, and DCA.
CONCLUSIONS: We have identified some important demographic and laboratory 
parameters related to the prognosis of patients with SAP and have used them to 
establish a more accurate and convenient nomogram for evaluating their 28-day, 
60-day, and 90-day mortality rates.

BACKGROUND: Epidemiological studies have demonstrated an association between red 
blood cell distribution width (RDW) and the prognosis of pneumonia-associated 
diseases. However, prognostic value of RDW in patients with 
ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) has yet to be investigated. This study 
aimed to explore the association between RDW and in-hospital mortality in VAP 
patients and explore predictive value of RDW for VAP patients.
METHODS: This retrospective cohort study included 1,543 VAP patients from the 
Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care IV database 2008-2019. The primary 
outcome was considered to 30-day in-hospital mortality of VAP patients in this 
study. Non-high RDW level group was defined as <15 %, and high RDW level group 
as ≥15%. The possible confounding factors were screened by least absolute 
shrinkage and selection operator regression. Univariate and multivariate COX 
regression analyses were used for the assessment on the association of RDW and 
30-day in-hospital mortality in VAP patients. We also performed subgroup 
analyses. Furthermore, a comparative analysis of RDW and sequential organ 
failure assessment (SOFA) score and simplified acute physiology score II (SAPS 
II) were performed by receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves.
RESULTS: The 30-day in-hospital mortality of VAP patients was approximately 
19.05%. After adjusting all confounding factors, high RDW was associated with 
30-day in-hospital mortality among VAP patients by using non-high RDW as the 
reference [hazard ratio (HR) =1.29, 95% confidence interval (CI): 1.01-1.63]. 
Additionally, the relationship was also robust in several populations, such as 
patients were younger than 60 years, or had not a history of congestive heart 
failure, or had a history of sepsis, or had not received renal replacement 
therapy, or had a duration of mechanical ventilation for more than 7 days. The 
result of ROC indicated that RDW had a better prognostic value in predicting 
30-day in-hospital mortality for VAP patients than SOFA score and SAPS II score.
CONCLUSION: High RDW level is associated with an increased 30-day in-hospital 
mortality. The RDW is a promising biomarker in predicting 30-day in-hospital 
mortality for patients admitted to the ICU, regardless of VAP.

BACKGROUND: Alactic base excess (ABE) is a novel biomarker to evaluate the renal 
capability of handling acid-base disturbances, which has been found to be 
associated with adverse prognosis of sepsis and shock patients. This study aimed 
to evaluate the association between ABE and the risk of in-hospital mortality in 
patients with acute myocardial infarction (AMI).
METHODS: This retrospective cohort study collected AMI patients' clinical data 
from the Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care (MIMIC)-IV database. The 
outcome was in-hospital mortality after intensive care unit (ICU) admission. 
Univariate and multivariate Cox proportional hazards models were performed to 
assess the association of ABE with in-hospital mortality in AMI patients, with 
hazard ratios (HRs) and 95% confidence intervals (CI). To further explore the 
association, subgroup analyses were performed based on age, AKI, eGFR, sepsis, 
and AMI subtypes.
RESULTS: Of the total 2779 AMI patients, 502 died in hospital. Negative ABE 
(HR = 1.26, 95%CI: 1.02-1.56) (neutral ABE as reference) was associated with a 
higher risk of in-hospital mortality in AMI patients, but not in positive ABE 
(P = 0.378). Subgroup analyses showed that negative ABE was significantly 
associated with a higher risk of in-hospital mortality in AMI patients aged>65 
years (HR = 1.46, 95%CI: 1.13-1.89), with eGFR<60 (HR = 1.35, 95%CI: 1.05-1.74), 
with AKI (HR = 1.32, 95%CI: 1.06-1.64), with ST-segment elevation acute 
myocardial infarction (STEMI) subtype (HR = 1.79, 95%CI: 1.18-2.72), and without 
sepsis (HR = 1.29, 95%CI: 1.01-1.64).
CONCLUSION: Negative ABE was significantly associated with in-hospital mortality 
in patients with AMI.

BACKGROUND: Sepsis is a globally recognized health issue that continues to 
contribute significantly to mortality and morbidity in intensive care units 
(ICUs). The association between mean arterial pressure (MAP) and prognosis among 
patients with patients is yet to be demonstrated.
OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to explore the association between MAP and 
28-day mortality in ICU patients with sepsis using data from a large, 
multicenter database.
METHODS: This is a retrospective cohort study. We extracted data of 35,010 
patients with sepsis from the MIMIC-IV (Medical Information Mart for Intensive 
Care) database between 2008 and 2019, according to the Sepsis 3.0 diagnostic 
criteria. The MAP was calculated as the average of the highest and lowest 
readings within the first 24 hours of ICU admission, and patients were divided 
into 4 groups based on the mean MAP, using the quadruple classification 
approach. Other worst-case indications from the first 24 hours of ICU admission, 
such as vital signs, severity of illness scores, laboratory indicators, and 
therapies, were also gathered as baseline data. The independent effects of MAP 
on 28-day mortality were explored using binary logistic regression and a 
two-piecewise linear model, with MAP as the exposure and 28-day mortality as the 
outcome variables, respectively. To address the nonlinearity relationship, curve 
fitting and a threshold effect analysis were performed.
RESULTS: A total of 34,981 patients with sepsis were included in the final 
analysis, the mean age was 66.67 (SD 16.01) years, and the 28-day mortality rate 
was 16.27% (5691/34,981). The generalized additive model and smoothed curve 
fitting found a U-shaped relationship between MAP and 28-day mortality in these 
patients. The recursive algorithm determined the low and high inflection points 
as 70 mm and 82 mm Hg, respectively. Our data demonstrated that MAP was 
negatively associated with 28-day mortality in the range of 34.05 mm Hg-69.34 mm 
Hg (odds ratio [OR] 0.93, 95% CI 0.92-0.94; P<.001); however, once the MAP 
exceeded 82 mm Hg, a positive association existed between MAP and 28-day 
mortality of patients with sepsis (OR 1.01; 95% CI 1.01-1.02, P=.002).
CONCLUSIONS: There is a U-shaped association between MAP and the probability of 
28-day mortality in patients with sepsis. Both the lower and higher MAP were 
related with a higher risk of mortality in patients with sepsis. These patients 
have a decreased risk of mortality when their MAP remains between 70 and 82 mm 
Hg.

BACKGROUND: Serum ferritin (SF) is clinically found to be elevated in many 
disease conditions, and our research examines serum ferritin in patients with 
acute kidney injury (AKI) and its implication on the risk of short-term 
mortality in AKI.
METHODS: Data were extracted from the Medical Information Mart for Intensive 
Care IV 2.2 (MIMIC-IV 2.2) database. Adult patients with AKI who had serum 
ferritin tested on the first day of ICU admission were included. The primary 
outcome was 28-day mortality. Kaplan-Meier survival curves and Cox proportional 
hazards models were used to test the relationship between SF and clinical 
outcomes. Subgroup analyses based on the Cox model were further conducted.
RESULTS: Kaplan-Meier survival curves showed that a higher SF value was 
significantly associated with an enhanced risk of 28-day mortality, 90-day 
mortality, ICU mortality and hospital mortality (log-rank test: p < 0.001 for 
all clinical outcomes). In multivariate Cox regression analysis, high level of 
SF with mortality was significantly positive in all four outcome events (all 
p < 0.001). This result remains robust after adjusting for all variables. 
Subgroup analysis of SF with 28-day mortality based on Cox model-4 showed that 
high level of SF was associated with high risk of 28-day mortality in patients 
regardless of the presence or absence of sepsis (p for interaction = 0.730). 
Positive correlations of SF and 28-day mortality were confirmed in all other 
subgroups (p for interaction>0.05).
CONCLUSION: High level of SF is an independent prognostic predictor of 28-day 
mortality in patients with AKI.

Sepsis is a leading cause of mortality in the intensive care unit. Early 
prediction of sepsis can reduce the overall mortality rate and cost of sepsis 
treatment. Some studies have predicted mortality and development of sepsis using 
machine learning models. However, there is a gap between the creation of 
different machine learning algorithms and their implementation in clinical 
practice.This study utilized data from the Medical Information Mart for 
Intensive Care III. We established and compared the gradient boosting decision 
tree (GBDT), logistic regression (LR), k-nearest neighbor (KNN), random forest 
(RF), and support vector machine (SVM).A total of 3937 sepsis patients were 
included, with 34.3% mortality in the Medical Information Mart for Intensive 
Care III group. In our comparison of 5 machine learning models (GBDT, LR, KNN, 
RF, and SVM), the GBDT model showed the best performance with the highest area 
under the receiver operating characteristic curve (0.992), recall (94.8%), 
accuracy (95.4%), and F1 score (0.933). The RF, SVM, and KNN models showed 
better performance (area under the receiver operating characteristic curve: 
0.980, 0.898, and 0.877, respectively) than the LR (0.876).The GBDT model showed 
better performance than other machine learning models (LR, KNN, RF, and SVM) in 
predicting the mortality of patients with sepsis in the intensive care unit. 
This could be used to develop a clinical decision support system in the future.

OBJECTIVE: To investigate the risk factors affecting the prognosis of patients 
with acute kidney injury (AKI) in the intensive care unit (ICU) based on the 
Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care III (MIMIC-III) database, and to 
establish a prognostic model for AKI.
METHODS: Patients (aged ≥ 18 years) with acute renal failure, admitted to the 
ICU for the first time, and had complete hospital records (the RIFLE diagnostic 
criteria were used in the database, and the diagnosis was expressed as AKI in 
this article) were screened from MIMIC-III database according to diagnostic 
codes. Patients were divided into two groups based on survival state at 
discharge, and the general information, underlying diseases, injury factors, 
vital signs and laboratory indicators within 24 hours after AKI, related 
intervention and prognostic indicators were analyzed. Univariate and 
multivariate Logistic regression analysis were used to determine the risk 
factors affecting mortality in patients with AKI and established a prediction 
model. The receiver operator characteristic curve (ROC curve) was used to 
analyze the predictive value of the prediction model for the prognosis of AKI 
patients.
RESULTS: There were 4 554 patients with AKI included and 862 died, with 
mortality of 18.93%. Univariate Logistic regression analysis was performed for 
factors that might be associated with death in AKI patients, and the results 
showed that age, hypertension, lymphoma, metastatic carcinoma, vancomycin, 
aspirin, coagulation abnormalities, cardiac arrest, sepsis or septic shock, 
invasive mechanical ventilation, white blood cell count (WBC), platelet count 
(PLT), K+, blood urea nitrogen (BUN), total bilirubin (TBil), renal replacement 
therapy (RRT) and length of stay (LOS) were independent risk factors [odds ratio 
(OR) and 95% confidence interval (95%CI) were 1.002 (1.001-1.003), 0.764 
(0.618-0.819), 1.749 (1.112-2.752), 2.606 (1.968-3.451), 1.779 (1.529-2.071), 
0.689 (0.563-0.842), 1.871 (1.590-2.201), 2.468 (1.209-5.036), 2.610 
(2.226-3.060), 2.154 (1.853-2.505), 1.105 (1.009-1.021), 0.998 (0.997-0.998), 
1.132 (1.057-1.212), 1.008 (1.006-1.011), 1.061 (1.049-1.073), 2.142 
(1.793-2.997), 0.805 (0.778-1.113), all P < 0.05]. Further binary Logistic 
regression analysis showed that lymphoma, metastatic cancer, vancomycin, cardiac 
arrest, sepsis or septic shock, coagulation dysfunction, invasive mechanical 
ventilation, increased BUN, increased TBil, increased or decreased blood K+ and 
increased WBC were independent risk factors for death [β values were 0.636, 
1.005, 0.207, 0.894, 0.787, 0.346, 0.686, 0.006, 0.051, 0.085, and 0.009; OR and 
95%CI were 1.889 (1.177-3.031), 2.733 (2.027-3.683), 1.229 (1.040-1.453), 2.445 
(1.165-5.133), 2.197 (1.850-2.610), 1.413 (1.183-1.689), 1.987 (1.688-2.338), 
1.006 (1.003-1.009), 1.052 (1.039-1.065), 1.089 (1.008-1.176), and 1.009 
(1.004-1.015), respectively, all P < 0.05]. The Hosmer-Lemeshow test showed that 
the AKI prognostic model was able to fit the observed data well (P = 0.604). ROC 
curve analysis showed that the area under ROC curve (AUC) of the AKI prognostic 
model was 0.716 (95%CI was 0.697-0.735), when the cut-off value was 0.320, the 
sensitivity was 71.9%, the specificity was 60.1%, the positive likelihood ratio 
was 1.80, and the negative likelihood ratio was 0.47.
CONCLUSIONS: The prognostic prediction model of AKI in critically ill patients 
established and based on the MIMIC-III database may have practical significance 
for prognostic risk assessment of AKI and later intervention.

Background: Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) is a common and serious 
nosocomial infection of intensive-care units (ICUs). Accurate, timely diagnosis 
enables early VAP patients to receive appropriate therapies and reduce the 
occurrence of complication. However, so far clinical datas regarding the 
epidemiology and mortality of VAP are still limited. Medical Information Mart 
for Intensive Care (MIMIC) database is a free, open and public resource about 
ICU research database. MIMIC database is a free, open, public database that 
collects information on more than 40,000 ICU patients who are predominantly 
white people. Therefore, the purpose of the present study is to observe and 
describe the clinical characteristics of VAP patients in ICU from the MIMIC 
database. Method: A total of 418 patients were enrolled in the study. General 
information, ventilator use information, microbiology information, antibiotic 
use information, and some nursing-related information were extracted to describe 
and analyze the clinical features of VAP patients. Results: The results of the 
study showed that patients with one or three pathogens were the most. The main 
pathogens were YEAST (16.71%), STAPH AUREUS COAG+ (11.63%), Staphylococcus, 
COAGULASE NEGATIVE (8.68%), GRAM NEGATIVE ROD (S) (6.14%), and Pseudomonas 
aeruginosa (5.73%). Patients using 4 antibiotics were the most. The top five 
antibiotics in the largest proportion were synthetic antibacterials (24.66%), 
peptides (20.13%), cephalosporins (19.60%), penicillins (13.54%), and 
aminoglycosides (5.27%). Conclusion: This study summarizes the common pathogens 
of VAP and the antibiotics commonly used in the treatment of VAP by describing 
the clinical information of 418 patients with VAP in the MIMIC database. In 
clinical treatment, we should pay attention to aseptic operation, develop 
appropriate antibacterial measures, closely monitor the pathogens of VAP 
infection, and use antibiotics in a timely manner to control the occurrence and 
development of VAP.

ADT²R: Adaptive Decision Transformer for Dynamic Treatment Regimes in Sepsis.

Jeon E, Choi JH, Suk HI.

Dynamic treatment regimes (DTRs), which comprise a series of decisions taken to 
select adequate treatments, have attracted considerable attention in the 
clinical domain, especially from sepsis researchers. Existing sepsis DTR 
learning studies are mainly based on offline reinforcement learning (RL) 
approaches working on electronic healthcare records data. However, a trained 
policy may choose a treatment different from a human clinician's prescription. 
Furthermore, most of them do not consider: 1) heterogeneity in sepsis; 2) 
short-term transitions; and 3) the relationship between a patient's health state 
and the prescription. We propose a novel framework, an adaptive decision 
transformer for DTR (ADT2R), which recommends an optimal treatment action for 
each time step depending on the heterogeneity of the sepsis and a patient's 
evolving health states. Specifically, we devise a trajectory-optimization-based 
module to be trained with supervision for treatments and adaptively aggregate 
the multihead self-attentions by deliberating on various inherent time-varying 
patterns among sepsis patients. Furthermore, we estimate the patient's health 
state by adopting an actor-critic (AC) algorithm and inform the treatment 
recommendation by learning about its short-term changes. We validated the 
effectiveness of the proposed framework on the Medical Information Mart for 
Intensive Care III (MIMIC-III) dataset, an extensive intensive care database, by 
demonstrating performance comparable to the state-of-the-art methods.

OBJECTIVE: In septic patients, multiple retrospective studies show an 
association between large volumes of fluids administered in the first 24 h and 
mortality, suggesting a benefit to fluid restrictive strategies. However, these 
studies do not directly estimate the causal effects of fluid-restrictive 
strategies, nor do their analyses properly adjust for time-varying confounding 
by indication. In this study, we used causal inference techniques to estimate 
mortality outcomes that would result from imposing a range of arbitrary limits 
("caps") on fluid volume administration during the first 24 h of intensive care 
unit (ICU) care.
DESIGN: Retrospective cohort study SETTING: ICUs at the Beth Israel Deaconess 
Medical Center, 2008-2012 PATIENTS: One thousand six hundred thirty-nine septic 
patients (defined by Sepsis-3 criteria) 18 years and older, admitted to the ICU 
from the emergency department (ED), who received less than 4 L fluids 
administered prior to ICU admission MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Data were 
obtained from the Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care III (MIMIC-III). 
We employed a dynamic Marginal Structural Model fit by inverse probability of 
treatment weighting to obtain confounding adjusted estimates of mortality rates 
that would have been observed had fluid resuscitation volume caps between 
4 L-12 L been imposed on the population. The 30-day mortality in our cohort was 
17%. We estimated that caps between 6 and 10 L on 24 h fluid volume would have 
reduced 30-day mortality by - 0.6 to - 1.0%, with the greatest reduction at 8 L 
(- 1.0% mortality, 95% CI [- 1.6%, - 0.3%]).
CONCLUSIONS: We found that 30-day mortality would have likely decreased relative 
to observed mortality under current practice if these patients had been subject 
to "caps" on the total volume of fluid administered between 6 and 10 L, with the 
greatest reduction in mortality rate at 8 L.

We retrospectively analyzed data from the Medical Information Mart for Intensive 
Care-III critical care database to determine whether visually-assessed right 
ventricular (RV) dysfunction was associated with clinical outcomes in septic 
shock patients. Associations between visually-assessed RV dysfunction by 
echocardiography and in-hospital mortality, lethal arrhythmia, and hemodynamic 
indicators to determine the prognostic value of RV dysfunction in patients with 
septic shock were analyzed. Propensity score analysis showed RV dysfunction was 
associated with increased risk of in-hospital death in patients with septic 
shock (adjusted odds ratio [OR] 2.15; 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.99-2.32; 
P < 0.001). In multivariate logistic regression analysis, RV dysfunction was 
associated with in-hospital death (OR 2.19; 95% CI 1.91-2.53; P < 0.001), lethal 
arrhythmia (OR 2.19; 95% CI 1.34-3.57; P < 0.001), and tendency for increased 
blood lactate levels (OR 1.31; 95% CI 1.14-1.50; P < 0.001) independent of left 
ventricular (LV) dysfunction. RV dysfunction was associated with lower cardiac 
output, pulmonary artery pressure index, and RV stroke work index. In patients 
with septic shock, visually-assessed RV dysfunction was associated with 
in-hospital mortality, lethal arrhythmia, and circulatory insufficiency 
independent of LV dysfunction. Visual assessment of RV dysfunction using 
echocardiography might help to identify the short-term prognosis of patients 
with septic shock by reflecting hemodynamic status.

This study aimed to investigate the relationship between unintentional weight 
loss and 30-day mortality in sepsis patients in the intensive care unit (ICU). A 
retrospective cohort study sepsis patients in the ICU was conducted using data 
from the Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care IV (MIMIC-IV) database, 
involving 1842 sepsis patients in the ICU. We utilized multivariate Cox 
regression analysis to evaluate the association between unintentional weight 
loss and the risk of 30-day mortality. In addition, we conducted stratified and 
interaction analyses to determine the consistency of this association across 
various demographic and clinical subgroups. Out of the 1842 patients, 19.2% 
(354) died within 30 days. The fully adjusted multivariate Cox regression model 
revealed that for every one-unit decrease in body weight, the risk of death 
increased by 58% (hazard ratio [HR] = 1.58; 95% confidence interval 
[CI] = 1.20-2.07). Unintentional weight loss was found to be positively 
correlated with 30-day mortality. Subgroup analysis yielded consistent results 
across all groups. Unintentional weight loss was positively associated with a 
greater risk of mortality in critically ill patients with sepsis in the ICU.

Early identification of sepsis in emergency department patients is critical for 
initiating timely interventions, highlighting the need for effective predictive 
scoring systems. A retrospective observational study was conducted using data 
from the CETAT database collected between December 2019 and October 2021. The 
study evaluated how well the systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS), 
quick Sepsis-related Organ Failure Assessment (qSOFA), and National Early 
Warning Score (NEWS) scoring systems, along with logistic regression models, 
predict sepsis, and high-risk sepsis in emergency department patients. The 
logistic regression models were further optimized by incorporating additional 
features based on local data. A total of 12,799 patients were analyzed, 
including 1360 sepsis cases, of which 373 were classified as high-risk sepsis. 
The NEWS score demonstrated superior predictive performance compared to qSOFA 
and SIRS, with an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve 
(AUC-ROC) of 0.737 (95% confidence interval [CI] 0.72–0.75) for sepsis and 0.653 
(95% CI 0.62–0.69) for high risk sepsis . After optimization, the NEWS-based 
model improved to an AUC-ROC of 0.756 (95% CI 0.74–0.77) for sepsis and 0.718 
(95% CI 0.69–0.75) for high-risk sepsis. Further enhancement was observed with 
the inclusion of additional clinical variables, resulting in AUC-ROC values of 
0.834 (95% CI 0.82–0.85) for sepsis and 0.756 (95% CI 0.73–0.78) for high-risk 
sepsis. Data from the Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care (MIMIC)-IV 
database, which included sepsis status and relevant variables for SIRS, qSOFA, 
and NEWS score calculations, confirmed that the optimized NEWS-based model 
improved the sepsis prediction AUC-ROC from 0.690 (95% CI 0.68–0.70) to 0.708 
(95% CI 0.70–0.72), and consistently outperformed qSOFA and SIRS in sepsis 
prediction.

OBJECTIVE: We identified predictive factors and developed a novel machine 
learning (ML) model for predicting mortality risk in patients with 
sepsis-associated encephalopathy (SAE).
METHODS: In this retrospective cohort study, data from the Medical Information 
Mart for Intensive Care IV (MIMIC-IV) and eICU Collaborative Research Database 
were used for model development and external validation. The primary outcome was 
the in-hospital mortality rate among patients with SAE; the observed in-hospital 
mortality rate was 14.74% (MIMIC IV: 1112, eICU: 594). Using the least absolute 
shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO), we built nine ML models and a stacking 
ensemble model and determined the optimal model based on the area under the 
receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC). We used the Shapley additive 
explanations (SHAP) algorithm to determine the optimal model.
RESULTS: The study included 9943 patients. LASSO identified 15 variables. The 
stacking ensemble model achieved the highest AUC on the test set (0.807) and 
0.671 on external validation. SHAP analysis highlighted Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) 
and age as key variables. The model (https://sic1.shinyapps.io/SSAAEE/) can 
predict in-hospital mortality risk for patients with SAE.
CONCLUSIONS: We developed a stacked ensemble model with enhanced generalization 
capabilities using novel data to predict mortality risk in patients with SAE.

BACKGROUND: Hemodynamic management is of paramount importance in patients with 
septic shock. Echocardiography has been increasingly used in assessing volume 
status and cardiac function. However, whether the utilization of 
echocardiography has an impact on prognosis is unknown. Thus, we intended to 
explore its effect on the outcomes of patients with septic shock.
METHODS: The study was based on the Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care 
(MIMIC) III database. Septic shock patients were divided into two groups 
according to the usage of echocardiography during the onset of septic shock. The 
primary outcome was 28-day mortality. Secondary outcomes included the usage of 
inotropes, ventilation-free and norepinephrine-free time, and fluids input. 
Propensity-score matching was used to reduce the imbalance.
RESULTS: Among 3,291 eligible patients, 1,289 patients who underwent 
echocardiography (Echo), and 1,289 who did not receive the Echo, had similar 
propensity scores and were included in the analyses. After matching, the Echo 
group had a significantly lower 28-day mortality (33.2% vs. 37.7%, P=0.019). 
More patients in the Echo group received pulmonary artery catheter (PAC) (4.2% 
vs. 0.2%, P<0.001) and inotropes (17.8% vs. 7.1%, P<0.001). In the survival 
analysis, Echo utilization was associated with improved 28-day mortality [hazard 
ratio (HR): 0.83; 95% confidence interval (CI), 0.73-0.95, P=0.005]. A reduced 
likelihood of 28-day mortality in patients with Echo vs. those without Echo was 
maintained either when excluding patients receiving multiple echocardiography 
scans (HR, 0.82; 95% CI, 0.72-0.94; P=0.004) or when excluding patients 
undergoing PAC or pulse index continuous cardiac output (PiCCO) (HR, 0.87; 95% 
CI, 0.76-0.99; P=0.034).
CONCLUSIONS: Utilization of echocardiography was associated with improved 28-day 
outcomes in patients with septic shock.

PURPOSE: Haemodynamic management is essential in sepsis management. Invasive 
blood pressure (IBP) monitoring is the gold standard for blood pressure (BP) 
assessment. Here, we identified the most advantageous time frame for IBP 
monitoring to mitigate adverse outcomes in patients with sepsis.
METHODS: We included data on patients with sepsis from the Medical Information 
Mart for Intensive Care IV database. The primary endpoints comprised 28-and 
90-day mortality rates, whereas secondary endpoints were acute kidney injury 
(AKI) rates and continuous renal replacement therapy (CRRT) requirement. To 
confirm our findings' robustness, we performed multivariable Cox regression and 
logistic regression models, augmented by propensity score matching (PSM).
RESULTS: Of 18,326 patients hospitalised for sepsis, 9,056 (49.42%) and 9,270 
(50.58%) were included in the early and delayed IBP-monitoring groups, 
respectively. Our multivariable Cox regression models revealed 20 and 21% 
significant increases in 28-and 90-day mortality in the delayed IBP monitoring 
group, respectively [hazard ratios (95% confidence intervals) = 1.20 (1.11-1.31) 
and 1.21 (1.12-1.31), respectively; both p < 0.001]. Moreover, significant 
increases were noted in AKI, CRRT and mechanical ventilation requirement risks 
in the delayed IBP monitoring group [odds ratios (95% confidence 
intervals) = 1.44 (1.34-1.56), 1.50 (1.26-1.78) and 1.79 (1.67-1.92), 
respectively; both p < 0.001]. PSM further confirmed the validity of our 
findings. Delayed IBP monitoring prolonged intensive care unit (ICU) stay 
without extending vasopressor use duration.
CONCLUSION: Prolonged delay in IBP monitoring (≥3 h) may increase mortality 
risks in ICU patients with sepsis. Nevertheless, early IBP monitoring may reduce 
AKI, CRRT and mechanical ventilation requirement risks and shorten ICU stay. 
However, these results warrant further validation through randomised controlled 
trials.

Background: Acute kidney injury (AKI) is a significant cause of morbidity and 
mortality, especially in sepsis patients. Early prediction of AKI can help 
physicians determine the appropriate intervention, and thus, improve the 
outcome. This study aimed to develop a nomogram to predict the risk of AKI in 
sepsis patients (S-AKI) in the initial 24 h following admission.Methods: Sepsis 
patients with AKI who met the Sepsis 3.0 criteria and Kidney Disease: Improving 
Global Outcomes criteria in the Massachusetts Institute of Technology critical 
care database, Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care (MIMIC-III), were 
identified for analysis. Data were analyzed using multiple logistic regression, 
and the performance of the proposed nomogram was evaluated based on Harrell's 
concordance index (C-index) and the area under the receiver operating 
characteristic curve.Results: We included 2917 patients in the analysis; 1167 of 
2042 patients (57.14%) and 469 of 875 patients (53.6%) had AKI in the training 
and validation cohorts, respectively. The predictive factors identified by 
multivariate logistic regression were blood urea nitrogen level, infusion 
volume, lactate level, weight, blood chloride level, body temperature, and age. 
With the incorporation of these factors, our model had well-fitted calibration 
curves and achieved good C-indexes of 0.80 [95% confidence interval (CI): 
0.78-0.82] and 0.79 (95% CI: 0.76-0.82) in predicting S-AKI in the training and 
validation cohorts, respectively.Conclusion: The proposed nomogram effectively 
predicted AKI risk in sepsis patients admitted to the intensive care unit in the 
first 24 h.

OBJECTIVES: Although platelets have been linked to inflammatory development in 
sepsis, knowledge on their role as an indicator in sepsis treatment is scarce. 
Here, we investigated the association between time-dependent changes in platelet 
counts with mortality rates to reveal the role of platelets in sepsis therapy.
DESIGN: A retrospective cohort study.
SETTING: We screened the Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care (MIMIC-IV), 
a public database comprising data from critical care subjects at the Beth Israel 
Deaconess Medical Center (BIDMC) in Boston, Massachusetts, USA.
PARTICIPANTS: A total of 7981 patients, who were admitted to the BIDMC between 
2008 and 2019, were analysed based on Sepsis-3 criteria from MIMIC-IV.
PRIMARY AND SECONDARY OUTCOME MEASURES: Primary and secondary outcomes included 
30-day mortality after admission and length of intensive care unit (ICU) stay 
and hospitalisation, respectively.
RESULTS: Patients with ≤10% reduction in proportion of platelet counts were 
associated with significantly lower 30-day mortality (14.1% vs 23.5%, p<0.001, 
Kaplan-Meier analysis, p<0.0001). Multivariable analysis revealed that decreased 
platelet-count percentage ≤10% on day 4 after ICU admission was associated with 
lower probability of 30-day non-survival (OR=0.73, 95% CI 0.64 to 0.82, 
p＜0.001). Patients in the ≤10% group had significantly shorter ICU stays than 
those in the >10% group (6.8 vs 7.5, p＜0.001). Restricted cubic spline curves 
revealed that mortality rates decreased with increase in proportion of platelet 
counts.
CONCLUSIONS: A ≤10% decrease in platelet-count percentage among sepsis patients 
after treatments is independently associated with decreased 30-day mortality, 
suggesting that changes in proportion of platelet counts after treatments could 
be an indicator for assessing the therapeutic effects of sepsis.

BACKGROUND: To identify the distinct trajectories of the Sequential Organ 
Failure Assessment (SOFA) scores at 72 h for patients with sepsis in the Medical 
Information Mart for Intensive Care (MIMIC)-IV database and determine their 
effects on mortality and adverse clinical outcomes.
METHODS: A retrospective cohort study was carried out involving patients with 
sepsis from the MIMIC-IV database. Group-based trajectory modeling (GBTM) was 
used to identify the distinct trajectory groups for the SOFA scores in patients 
with sepsis in the intensive care unit (ICU). The Cox proportional hazards 
regression model was used to investigate the relationship between the 
longitudinal change trajectory of the SOFA score and mortality and adverse 
clinical outcomes.
RESULTS: A total of 16,743 patients with sepsis were included in the cohort. The 
median survival age was 66 years (interquartile range: 54-76 years). The 7-day 
and 28-day in-hospital mortality were 6.0% and 17.6%, respectively. Five 
different trajectories of SOFA scores according to the model fitting standard 
were determined: group 1 (32.8%), group 2 (30.0%), group 3 (17.6%), group 4 
(14.0%) and group 5 (5.7%). Univariate and multivariate Cox regression analyses 
showed that, for different clinical outcomes, trajectory group 1 was used as the 
reference, while trajectory groups 2-5 were all risk factors associated with the 
outcome (P < 0.001). Subgroup analysis revealed an interaction between the two 
covariates of age and mechanical ventilation and the different trajectory groups 
of patients' SOFA scores (P < 0.05).
CONCLUSION: This approach may help identify various groups of patients with 
sepsis, who may be at different levels of risk for adverse health outcomes, and 
provide subgroups with clinical importance.

INTRODUCTION: The present study presents the development and validation of a 
clinical prediction model using random survival forest (RSF) and stepwise Cox 
regression, aiming to predict the probability of pelvic inflammatory disease 
(PID) progressing to sepsis.
METHODS: A retrospective cohort study was conducted, gathering clinical data of 
patients diagnosed with PID between 2008 and 2019 from the Medical Information 
Mart for Intensive Care (MIMIC)-IV database. Patients who met the Sepsis 3.0 
diagnostic criteria were selected, with sepsis as the outcome. Univariate Cox 
regression and stepwise Cox regression were used to screen variables for 
constructing a nomogram. Moreover, an RSF model was created using machine 
learning algorithms. To verify the model's performance, a calibration curve, 
decision curve analysis (DCA), and receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve 
were utilized. Furthermore, the capabilities of the two models for estimating 
the incidence of sepsis in PID patients within 3 and 7 days were compared.
RESULTS: A total of 1064 PID patients were included, of whom 54 had progressed 
to sepsis. The established nomogram highlighted dialysis, reduced platelet (PLT) 
counts, history of pneumonia, medication of glucocorticoids, and increased 
leukocyte counts as significant predictive factors. The areas under the curve 
(AUCs) of the nomogram for prediction of PID progression to sepsis at 3-day and 
7-day (3-/7-day) in the training set and the validation set were 0.886/0.863 and 
0.824/0.726, respectively, and the C-index of the model was 0.8905. The RSF 
displayed excellent performance, with AUCs of 0.939/0.919 and 0.712/0.571 for 
3-/7-day risk prediction in the training set and validation set, respectively.
CONCLUSION: The nomogram accurately predicted the incidence of sepsis in PID 
patients, and relevant risk factors were identified. While the RSF model 
outperformed the Cox regression models in predicting sepsis incidence, its 
performance exhibited some instability. On the other hand, the Cox 
regression-based nomogram displayed stable performance and improved 
interpretability, thereby supporting clinical decision-making in PID treatment.

OBJECTIVE: To develop and validate a model for predicting death risk in septic 
shock patients using LASSO-Logistic methods.
METHODS: A retrospective cohort study was conducted. Based on the open-source 
database Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care-III v1.4 (MIMIC-III v1.4), 
the septic shock patients meeting the Sepsis-3 criteria were included, and the 
data on demographic characteristics, major signs, laboratory examinations, 
hospitalization, and outcomes were extracted. Predictive variables were selected 
by LASSO regression and predictive models were derived using Logistic 
regression. The calibration of the model was evaluated using the Hosmer-Lemeshow 
test and discrimination was evaluated using the receiver operator characteristic 
curve (ROC curve).
RESULTS: A total of 693 patients with septic shock were enrolled, in which 445 
patients survived and 248 patients dead within 30 days and the mortality was 
35.8%. Logistic regression model was constructed according to nine predictive 
variables and outcome variables screened by LASSO regression method, which 
showed that advanced age, Elixhauser index, blood lactic acid (Lac), K+ level 
and mechanical ventilation were associated with increased 30-day mortality [odds 
ratio (OR) and 95% confidence interval (95%CI) was 1.023 (1.010-1.037), 1.047 
(1.022-1.074), 1.213 (1.133-1.305), 2.241 (1.664-3.057), 2.165 (1.433-3.301), 
respectively, all P < 0.01], and reduced systolic blood pressure (SBP), 
diastolic blood pressure (DBP), body temperature, and pulse oxygen saturation 
(SpO2) were also associated with increased 30-day mortality [OR (95%CI) was 
0.974 (0.957-0.990), 0.972 (0.950-0.994), 0.693 (0.556-0.857), 0.971 
(0.949-0.992), respectively, all P < 0.05]. The calibration curve showed that 
the predicted risk of septic shock death risk prediction model had good 
agreement with the real situation. ROC curve analysis showed that the area under 
the ROC curve (AUC) of the prediction model was 0.839 (95%CI was 0.803-0.876), 
which could distinguish patients at risk of death from those at risk of 
survival.
CONCLUSIONS: The septic shock death risk prediction model has a good ability to 
identify the 30-day mortality risk of septic shock patients, including nine 
hospital readily variables (age, Elixhauser index, mechanical ventilation, Lac, 
K+, SBP, DBP, body temperature and SpO2). The model could be used by clinicians 
to calculate the risk of death in septic shock individuals.

BACKGROUND: Considering morbidity, mortality, and annual treatment costs, the 
dramatic rise in the incidence of sepsis and septic shock among intensive care 
unit (ICU) admissions in US hospitals is an increasing concern. Recent changes 
in the sepsis definition (sepsis-3), based on the quick Sequential Organ Failure 
Assessment (qSOFA), have motivated the international medical informatics 
research community to investigate score recalculation and information retrieval, 
and to study the intersection between sepsis-3 and the previous definition 
(sepsis-2) based on systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS) parameters.
OBJECTIVE: The objective of this study was three-fold. First, we aimed to unpack 
the most prevalent criterion for sepsis (for both sepsis-3 and sepsis-2 
predictors). Second, we intended to determine the most prevalent sepsis scenario 
in the ICU among 4 possible scenarios for qSOFA and 11 possible scenarios for 
SIRS. Third, we investigated the multicollinearity or dichotomy among qSOFA and 
SIRS predictors.
METHODS: This observational study was conducted according to the most recent 
update of Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care (MIMIC-III, Version 1.4), 
the critical care database developed by MIT. The qSOFA (sepsis-3) and SIRS 
(sepsis-2) parameters were analyzed for patients admitted to critical care units 
from 2001 to 2012 in Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center (Boston, MA, USA) to 
determine the prevalence and underlying relation between these parameters among 
patients undergoing sepsis screening. We adopted a multiblind Delphi method to 
seek a rationale for decisions in several stages of the research design 
regarding handling missing data and outlier values, statistical imputations and 
biases, and generalizability of the study.
RESULTS: Altered mental status in the Glasgow Coma Scale (59.28%, 38,854/65,545 
observations) was the most prevalent sepsis-3 (qSOFA) criterion and the white 
blood cell count (53.12%, 17,163/32,311 observations) was the most prevalent 
sepsis-2 (SIRS) criterion confronted in the ICU. In addition, the two-factored 
sepsis criterion of high respiratory rate (≥22 breaths/minute) and altered 
mental status (28.19%, among four possible qSOFA scenarios besides no sepsis) 
was the most prevalent sepsis-3 (qSOFA) scenario, and the three-factored sepsis 
criterion of tachypnea, high heart rate, and high white blood cell count 
(12.32%, among 11 possible scenarios besides no sepsis) was the most prevalent 
sepsis-2 (SIRS) scenario in the ICU. Moreover, the absolute Pearson correlation 
coefficients were not significant, thereby nullifying the likelihood of any 
linear correlation among the critical parameters and assuring the lack of 
multicollinearity between the parameters. Although this further bolsters 
evidence for their dichotomy, the absence of multicollinearity cannot guarantee 
that two random variables are statistically independent.
CONCLUSIONS: Quantifying the prevalence of the qSOFA criteria of sepsis-3 in 
comparison with the SIRS criteria of sepsis-2, and understanding the underlying 
dichotomy among these parameters provides significant inferences for sepsis 
treatment initiatives in the ICU and informing hospital resource allocation. 
These data-driven results further offer design implications for multiparameter 
intelligent sepsis prediction in the ICU.

BACKGROUND: Sepsis is a highly lethal and heterogeneous disease. Utilization of 
an unsupervised method may identify novel clinical phenotypes that lead to 
targeted therapies and improved care.
METHODS: Our objective was to derive clinically relevant sepsis phenotypes from 
a multivariate panel of physiological data using subgraph-augmented nonnegative 
matrix factorization. We utilized data from the Medical Information Mart for 
Intensive Care III database of patients who were admitted to the intensive care 
unit with sepsis. The extracted data contained patient demographics, 
physiological records, sequential organ failure assessment scores, and 
comorbidities. We applied frequent subgraph mining to extract subgraphs from 
physiological time series and performed nonnegative matrix factorization over 
the subgraphs to derive patient clusters as phenotypes. Finally, we profiled 
these phenotypes based on demographics, physiological patterns, disease 
trajectories, comorbidities and outcomes, and performed functional validation of 
their clinical implications.
RESULTS: We analyzed a cohort of 5782 patients, derived three novel phenotypes 
of distinct clinical characteristics and demonstrated their prognostic 
implications on patient outcome. Subgroup 1 included relatively less 
severe/deadly patients (30-day mortality, 17%) and was the smallest-in-size 
group (n = 1218, 21%). It was characterized by old age (mean age, 73 years), a 
male majority (male-to-female ratio, 59-to-41), and complex chronic conditions. 
Subgroup 2 included the most severe/deadliest patients (30-day mortality, 28%) 
and was the second-in-size group (n = 2036, 35%). It was characterized by a male 
majority (male-to-female ratio, 60-to-40), severe organ dysfunction or failure 
compounded by a wide range of comorbidities, and uniquely high incidences of 
coagulopathy and liver disease. Subgroup 3 included the least severe/deadly 
patients (30-day mortality, 10%) and was the largest group (n = 2528, 44%). It 
was characterized by low age (mean age, 60 years), a balanced gender ratio 
(male-to-female ratio, 50-to-50), the least complicated conditions, and a 
uniquely high incidence of neurologic disease. These phenotypes were validated 
to be prognostic factors of mortality for sepsis patients.
CONCLUSIONS: Our results suggest that these phenotypes can be used to develop 
targeted therapies based on phenotypic heterogeneity and algorithms designed for 
monitoring, validating and intervening clinical decisions for sepsis patients.

BACKGROUND: Although some underpowered studies have proven that increased red 
blood cell distribution width (RDW) may be associated with short-term prognosis 
of sepsis, the long-term prognostic value of RDW remains largely unknown.
METHODS: This retrospective observational study was based on the Medical 
Information Mart for Intensive Care III (MIMIC III), a large critical care 
database. Baseline RDW and conventional disease severity scores were extracted 
along with data on 4-year mortality, of adult patients with severe sepsis upon 
first admission to the intensive care unit (ICU). The prognostic value of RDW 
was analyzed with Kapan-Meier cure, Cox model, receiver operating characteristic 
(ROC) curve analysis, net reclassification index (NRI) and integrated 
discriminatory index (IDI).
RESULTS: A total of 4264 subjects were included. The area under ROC curve of RDW 
for predicting 4-year mortality was 0.64 (95% CI: 0.63-0.66). In multivariable 
Cox model, increased RDW was independently associated with all-cause mortality, 
irrespective of anemia. With conventional severity scores as reference, RDW had 
continuous NRI comprised between 0.18 and 0.20, and IDI comprised between 0.30 
and 0.40.
CONCLUSION: RDW values significantly predicts long-term all-cause mortality in 
critically ill patients with severe sepsis beyond conventional severity scores.

BACKGROUND: To construct a nomogram and a Randomized Survival Forest (RSF) model 
for predicting the occurrence of sepsis in patients with cerebral infarction in 
intensive care units (ICUs).
METHODS: A total of 1,963 patients were included from the Medical Information 
Mart for Intensive Care IV database version 2.0 (MIMIC-IV v2.0). Screening 
features based on Cox regression and Lasso regression for nomogram and RSF 
modeling.
RESULTS: Patients were randomly split into a training set (1,374 cases) and a 
validation set (589 cases) at a ratio of 7:3. Risk factors in the nomogram model 
included atenolol, bicarbonate, calcium, clopidogrel, dipyridamole, heart 
failure, lymphocyte percent, midazolam, propofol, rhabdomyolysis, vancomycin, 
white blood cells, and antibiotics. In the training and validation sets, the 
nomogram predicted sepsis on the 3rd day of admission with an AUC of 0.798 and 
0.765 and predicted sepsis on the 7th day with an AUC of 0.808 and 0.736, 
respectively. In the training and validation sets, the RSF model predicted 
sepsis on the 3rd day of admission with an AUC of 0.899 and 0.775 and predicted 
sepsis on the 7th day with an AUC of 0.913 and 0.768, respectively CONCLUSIONS: 
The two models can reliably predict the probability of sepsis in patients with 
cerebral infarction in the intensive care unit, which can help clinicians to 
assess the condition and provide timely medical interventions for patients. The 
RSF model has better performance.

BACKGROUND: Sepsis is a systemic inflammatory response syndrome with high 
mortality. There is an upward trend in sepsis prevalence and mortality 
worldwide. Early and accurate prediction of outcome in sepsis is important. 
There remains a great need to improve a reliable prognostic model for sepsis 
patients with widely available variables. The aim of this study was to explore 
the correlation between serum thyroid hormone levels and prognosis in sepsis 
patients.
METHODS: Septic patients were identified from the Medical Information Mart for 
Intensive Care (MIMIC)-III database. Factors that were found to contribute to 
the outcome in the uni-variate analysis at P value <0.1 were included in the 
multivariate. Multivariate analysis was performed by binary logistic regression 
analysis, which allows adjust for confounding factors. We combined an assessment 
of thyroid hormone and some variables together, which improve the accurate 
prediction of outcome. The accuracy of the test was assessed measuring the area 
under the ROC curve (AUROC).
RESULTS: A total of 929 eligible septic patients were included in the data 
analysis. Seventy hundred and three patients had a good functional outcome, 
whereas 226 patients had a bad functional outcome. Thyroxin (T4) level was 
significantly decreased in patients with an unfavorable functional outcome as 
compared to patients with a favorable functional outcome (P < 0.01). Binary 
logistic regression analyses revealed that lower thyroxin concentrations on 
admission were associated with a risk for poor outcomes (OR 0.556, 95% CI 
0.41-0.75; P < 0.01). In addition, in ROC curve analysis, the combined model 
AUROC was 0.82 for ICU survival, which was significantly higher than the AUROCs 
of original fT4 (0.65 and 0.65), T4 (0.71 and 0.71) and SAPSII (0.70 and 0.72) 
(all P < 0.05).
CONCLUSIONS: Low serum thyroxin levels can be a predictive marker of short-term 
outcome after sepsis. A combined model (fT4, T4 and SAPSII score) can add 
significant additional predictive information to the clinical score of the 
SAPSII.

Assessing illness severity in the intensive care unit (ICU) is crucial for early 
prediction of deterioration and prognosis. Traditional prognostic scores often 
treat organ systems separately, overlooking the body's interconnected nature. 
Network physiology offers a new approach to understanding these complex 
interactions. This study used the concept of transfer entropy (TE) to measure 
information flow between heart rate (HR), respiratory rate (RR), and capillary 
oxygen saturation ([Formula: see text]) in critically ill patients with sepsis, 
hypothesizing that TE between these signals would correlate with disease 
outcome. The retrospective cohort study utilized the Medical Information Mart 
for Intensive Care III Clinical Database, including patients who met Sepsis-3 
criteria on admission and had 30 min of continuous HR, RR, and [Formula: see 
text] data. TE between the signals was calculated to create physiological 
network maps. Cox regression assessed the relationship between cardiorespiratory 
network indices and both deterioration [Sequential Organ Failure Assessment 
(SOFA) score increase of ≥2 points at 48 h] and 30-day mortality. Among 164 
patients, higher information flow from [Formula: see text] to HR [TE ([Formula: 
see text] → HR)] and reciprocal flow between HR and RR [TE (RR → HR) and TE (HR 
→ RR)] were linked to reduced mortality, independent of age, mechanical 
ventilation, SOFA score, and comorbidity. Reductions in TE (HR → RR), TE (RR → 
HR), TE ([Formula: see text] → RR), and TE ([Formula: see text] → HR) were 
associated with an increased risk of 48-h deterioration. After adjustment for 
potential confounders, only TE (HR → RR) and TE (RR → HR) remained statistically 
significant. The study confirmed that physiological network mapping using 
routine signals in patients with sepsis could indicate illness severity and that 
higher TE values were generally associated with improved outcomes.NEW & 
NOTEWORTHY This study adopts an integrative approach through physiological 
network analysis to investigate sepsis, with the goal of identifying differences 
in information transfer between physiological signals in sepsis survivors versus 
nonsurvivors. We found that greater information flow between heart rate, 
respiratory rate, and capillary oxygen saturation was associated with reduced 
mortality, independent of age, disease severity, and comorbidities. In addition, 
reduced information transfer was linked to an increased risk of 48-h 
deterioration in patients with sepsis.

Dynamic treatment regimes (DTRs) formalize medical decision-making as a sequence 
of rules for different stages, mapping patient-level information to recommended 
treatments. In practice, estimating an optimal DTR using observational data from 
electronic medical record (EMR) databases can be complicated by nonignorable 
missing covariates resulting from informative monitoring of patients. Since 
complete case analysis can provide consistent estimation of outcome model 
parameters under the assumption of outcome-independent missingness, Q-learning 
is a natural approach to accommodating nonignorable missing covariates. However, 
the backward induction algorithm used in Q-learning can introduce challenges, as 
nonignorable missing covariates at later stages can result in nonignorable 
missing pseudo-outcomes at earlier stages, leading to suboptimal DTRs, even if 
the longitudinal outcome variables are fully observed. To address this unique 
missing data problem in DTR settings, we propose 2 weighted Q-learning 
approaches where inverse probability weights for missingness of the 
pseudo-outcomes are obtained through estimating equations with valid nonresponse 
instrumental variables or sensitivity analysis. The asymptotic properties of the 
weighted Q-learning estimators are derived, and the finite-sample performance of 
the proposed methods is evaluated and compared with alternative methods through 
extensive simulation studies. Using EMR data from the Medical Information Mart 
for Intensive Care database, we apply the proposed methods to investigate the 
optimal fluid strategy for sepsis patients in intensive care units.

BACKGROUND: Sepsis remains a complex medical problem and a major challenge in 
healthcare. Diagnostics and outcome predictions are focused on physiological 
parameters with less consideration given to patients' medical background. Given 
the aging population, not only are diseases becoming increasingly prevalent but 
occur more frequently in combinations ("multimorbidity"). We hypothesized the 
existence of patient subgroups in critical care with distinct multimorbidity 
states. We further hypothesize that certain multimorbidity states associate with 
higher rates of organ failure, sepsis, and mortality co-occurring with these 
clinical problems.
METHODS: We analyzed 36,390 patients from the open source Medical Information 
Mart for Intensive Care III (MIMIC III) dataset. Morbidities were defined based 
on Elixhauser categories, a well-established scheme distinguishing 30 classes of 
chronic diseases. We used latent class analysis to identify distinct patient 
subgroups based on demographics, admission type, and morbidity compositions and 
compared the prevalence of organ dysfunction, sepsis, and inpatient mortality 
for each subgroup.
RESULTS: We identified six clinically distinct multimorbidity subgroups labeled 
based on their dominant Elixhauser disease classes. The "cardiopulmonary" and 
"cardiac" subgroups consisted of older patients with a high prevalence of 
cardiopulmonary conditions and constituted 6.1% and 26.4% of study cohort 
respectively. The "young" subgroup included 23.5% of the cohort composed of 
young and healthy patients. The "hepatic/addiction" subgroup, constituting 9.8% 
of the cohort, consisted of middle-aged patients (mean age of 52.25, 95% CI 
51.85-52.65) with the high rates of depression (20.1%), alcohol abuse (47.75%), 
drug abuse (18.2%), and liver failure (67%). The "complicated diabetics" and 
"uncomplicated diabetics" subgroups constituted 9.4% and 24.8% of the study 
cohort respectively. The complicated diabetics subgroup demonstrated higher 
rates of end-organ complications (88.3% prevalence of renal failure). Rates of 
organ dysfunction and sepsis ranged 19.6-69% and 12.5-46.7% respectively in the 
six subgroups. Mortality co-occurring with organ dysfunction and sepsis ranges 
was 8.4-23.8% and 11.7-27.4% respectively. These adverse outcomes were most 
prevalent in the hepatic/addiction subgroup.
CONCLUSION: We identify distinct multimorbidity states that associate with 
relatively higher prevalence of organ dysfunction, sepsis, and co-occurring 
mortality. The findings promote the incorporation of multimorbidity in 
healthcare models and the shift away from the current single-disease paradigm in 
clinical practice, training, and trial design.

BACKGROUND: Fluid resuscitation is a standard intervention for patients with 
sepsis, however, the ideal timing for initiating fluid deresuscitation has not 
been well established. This study examines the prognostic impact of early versus 
delayed initiation of loop diuretics in patients with sepsis.
METHODS: Data for this analysis were obtained from the Medical Information Mart 
for Intensive Care IV (MIMIC-IV) database. Patients diagnosed with sepsis were 
categorized into two groups based on the timing of loop diuretic administration: 
an early group (within 48 hours of diagnosis) and a late group (after 96 hours).
RESULTS: A total of 8,518 patients with sepsis were included in this study. Of 
these, 4,485 patients received loop diuretics within the first 48 hours (early 
group), while the remaining 4,033 patients received loop diuretics after 96 
hours (late group). In the early group, 75% of patients required mechanical 
ventilation, which was significantly lower than the 85.6% in the late group 
(P<0.001). However, the early group demonstrated a significantly higher 28-day 
mortality rate compared to the late group (832/4,485 vs. 679/4,033, P=0.03). Cox 
regression analysis indicated that the early initiation of diuretics was 
associated with an increased 28-day mortality rate [hazard ratio (HR) =2.590, 
95% confidence interval (CI): 2.325-2.884, P<0.001]. After adjusting for the 
proportional hazards assumption, the corrected HR was recalculated as 
exp[3.55-1.20 × ln(t)]. Propensity score matching (PSM) resulted in two 
well-matched groups of 1,882 patients each. Post-matching analysis revealed that 
the early group continued to exhibit significantly higher 28-day and in-hospital 
mortality (P<0.001) along with a significantly higher incidence of stage 3 acute 
kidney injury (AKI) (8.1% vs. 5.7%, P=0.004).
CONCLUSIONS: While complete adjustment for all potential confounding factors was 
not possible, the findings suggest that patients who received loop diuretics 
within 48 hours had more severe kidney injury and a significantly higher 
mortality rate compared to those who received later administration (after 96 
hours). These findings underscore the need for careful consideration when 
determining the timing of loop diuretic initiation in clinical practice.

INTRODUCTION: The objective of our study was to explore the association between 
sex and clinical outcome in sepsis patients in a large, diverse population.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: We analyzed 6,134 adult patients with sepsis from the 
critical care units of Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center between 2001 and 
2012. Study data were retrospectively extracted from Medical Information Mart 
for Intensive Care-III, a multiparameter intensive care database.
RESULTS: There were 2,677 (43.6%) female and 3,457 (56.4%) male patients. 
Compared with female patients, male patients with sepsis had a higher 1-year 
mortality rate (55.6% vs. 51.4%, P = 0.001), and so did the 90-day mortality 
rate (45.1% vs. 42.1%, P = 0.018). 33.8% of male and 31.3% of female patients 
with sepsis died during hospitalization (P = 0.041). The median length of 
hospitalization and intensive care unit (ICU) stay for male patients was 19.54 
and 7.54 days, while that for female patients was 16.49 and 6.75 days 
(P < 0.001, P = 0.002, respectively). Male patients were more likely to require 
dialysis therapy (P = 0.109), ventilation support (P = 0.012) and more 
vasoactive agents (dopamine P = 0.113, norepinephrine P = 0.016, and epinephrine 
P = 0.093) during the ICU period than female patients. Our Cox proportional 
hazard regression model confirmed that the risk of death within 1 year of ICU 
admission in male patients is 1.083 times that in female.
CONCLUSION: Female patients with sepsis have better clinical outcomes than male 
patients in terms of mortality and length of hospitalization and ICU stay.

OBJECTIVE: Early fluid resuscitation is crucial in the treatment of sepsis, yet 
the optimal dosage remains debated. This study aims to determine the optimal 
multi-stage fluid resuscitation dosage for sepsis patients.
METHODS: We propose a reinforcement learning algorithm with neural networks 
(RL-NN), utilizing the flexibility of deep learning architectures to mitigate 
model misspecification. We use cross-validation and random search for 
hyperparameter tuning to further enhance model robustness and generalization.
RESULTS: Simulation results demonstrate that our method outperforms existing 
methods in terms of both the percentage of correctly classified optimal 
treatments and the predicted counterfactual mean outcome. Applying this method 
to the sepsis cohort from the Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care III 
(MIMIC-III), we recommend that all sepsis patients receive adequate fluid 
resuscitation (≥ 30 mL/kg) within the first 3 h of admission to the MICU. Our 
approach is expected to significantly reduce the mean SOFA score by 23.71%, 
enhancing patient outcomes.
CONCLUSION: Our RL-NN method offers an accurate, real-time approach to 
optimizing sepsis treatment and aligns with the 'Surviving Sepsis Campaign' 
guidelines. It also has the potential to be integrated with existing electronic 
health record (EHR) systems, guiding clinical decision-making and thereby 
improving patient prognosis.

OBJECTIVES: Sepsis is an evolving process and proposed subtypes may change over 
time. We hypothesized that previously established sepsis subtypes are dynamic, 
prognostic of outcome, and trajectories are associated with host response 
alterations.
DESIGN: A secondary analysis of two observational critically ill sepsis cohorts: 
the Molecular diAgnosis and Risk stratification of Sepsis (MARS) and the Medical 
Information Mart for Intensive Care-IV (MIMIC-IV).
SETTING: ICUs in the Netherlands and United States between 2011-2014 and 
2008-2019, respectively.
PARTICIPANTS: Patient admission fulfilling the Sepsis-3 criteria upon ICU 
admission adjudicated to one of four previously identified subtypes, comprising 
2,416 admissions in MARS and 10,745 in MIMIC-IV.
MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Subtype stability and the changes per subtype on 
days 2, 4 and 7 of ICU admission were assessed. Next, the associated between 
change in clinical subtype and outcome and host response alterations.
RESULTS: In MARS, upon ICU admission, 6% (n = 150) of the patient admissions 
were α-type, 3% (n = 70) β-type, 55% (n = 1317) γ-type, and 36% (n = 879) 
δ-type; in MIMIC-IV, this was α = 22% (n = 2398), β = 22% (n = 2365), γ = 31% (n 
= 3296), and δ = 25% (2686). Overall, prevalence of subtypes was stable over 
days 2, 4, and 7. However, 28-56% (MARS/MIMIC-IV) changed from α on ICU 
admission to any of the other subtypes on day 2, 33-71% from β, 57-32% from γ, 
and 50-48% from δ. On day 4, overall subtype persistence was 33-36%. γ or δ 
admissions remaining in, or transitioning to, subtype γ on days 2, 4, and 7 
exhibited lower mortality rates compared with those remaining in, or 
transitioning to, subtype δ. Longitudinal host response biomarkers reflecting 
inflammation, coagulation, and endothelial dysfunction were most altered in the 
δ-δ group, followed by the γ-δ group, independent of the day or biomarker 
domain.
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: In two large cohorts, subtype change to δ was 
associated with worse clinical outcome and more aberrant biomarkers reflecting 
inflammation, coagulation, and endothelial dysfunction. These findings 
underscore the importance of monitoring sepsis subtypes and their linked host 
responses for improved prognostication and personalized treatment strategies.

Background: The relationship between the partial pressure of oxygen in arterial 
blood (PaO 2 ) and the prognosis of sepsis patients, and its potential variation 
over time, remains unclear. The optimal PaO 2 range for sepsis patients has 
always been a contentious issue, with no consensus. We aimed to explore the 
association between different levels of PaO 2 exposure over time and the 28-day 
mortality of sepsis patients, and to identify the optimal PaO 2 range for sepsis 
patients within a specific time frame. Methods: We retrieved data on adult 
patients diagnosed with sepsis within 24 h before or after intensive care unit 
(ICU) admission from the Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care IV 
(MIMIC-IV, version 2.2) database. We excluded patients who were not admitted to 
the ICU for the first time, those with ICU stay <24 h, and those without PaO 2 
results during their ICU stay. We calculated the time-weighted average (TWA) of 
PaO 2 and used piece-wise exponential additive mixed models (PAMMs) to estimate 
the time-dependent changes in the association between TWA-PaO 2 and patient 
prognosis. Results: A total of 16,880 sepsis patients were included in the MIMIC 
cohort. Results indicated that patients' TWA-PaO 2 correlates with increased 
28-day mortality after ICU admission in sepsis patients, and this association 
was mainly manifested in the early course of the disease. With a time window of 
the first 1-7 days after ICU admission, the optimal TWA-PaO 2 range for sepsis 
patients was ≥130 mmHg and ≤160 mmHg. Increased exposure time, proportion of 
exposure time, and exposure dose of high-risk PaO 2 outside the range were all 
associated with an increased risk of 28-day mortality. Conclusion: PaO 2 in 
sepsis patients should be closely monitored. During the first 1-7 days of ICU 
admission, PaO 2 should be maintained within the range of ≥130 mmHg and ≤160 
mmHg. A dose-dependent relationship exists between high-risk PaO 2 outside the 
range and patient outcome.

OBJECTIVE: To explore the risk factors of severe acute kidney injury (AKI) in 
septic patients, and to establish an hour-specific prediction model.
METHODS: Based on the information of septic patients in the Medical Information 
Mart for Intensive Care- IV (MIMIC- IV) database, general information, 
comorbidities, vital signs, severity scoring system, laboratory indicators, 
invasive operations and medication use were recorded. The enrolled patients were 
randomized into a training set and a validation set according to a ratio of 7 : 
3. AKI was diagnosed according to the guidelines of Kidney Disease: Improving 
Global Outcome (KDIGO). Based on Lasso regression and Cox regression, the risk 
factors of severe AKI (AKI stage 2 and stage 3) in septic patients were analyzed 
and hour-specific prediction model were established. Consistency index 
(C-index), area under the receiver operator characteristic curve (AUC) and 
calibration curve were used to assess the predictive efficacy of the model.
RESULTS: A total of 20 551 septic patients were enrolled, including 14 385 
patients in the training set and 6 166 patients in the validation set. 
Multivariate Cox regression analysis showed that atrial fibrillation [hazard 
ratio (HR) = 1.266, 95% confidence interval (95%CI) was 1.150-1.393], heart 
failure (HR = 1.348, 95%CI was 1.217-1.493), respiratory failure (HR = 1.565, 
95%CI was 1.428-1.715), heart rate (HR = 1.004, 95%CI was 1.002-1.007), mean 
arterial pressure (HR = 1.245, 95%CI was 1.126-1.377), lactic acid (HR = 1.051, 
95%CI was 1.025-1.077), simplified acute physiology score II (SAPS II, HR = 
1.019, 95%CI was 1.016-1.023), serum creatinine (HR = 1.171, 95%CI was 
1.127-1.216), anion gap (HR = 1.024, 95%CI was 1.010-1.038), serum potassium (HR 
= 1.155, 95%CI was 1.079-1.236), white blood cell count (HR = 1.006, 95%CI was 
1.003-1.009) and furosemide use (HR = 0.414, 95%CI was 0.368-0.467) were 
independently associated with severe AKI in septic patients (all P < 0.01). The 
above predictors were applied to construct an hour-specific prediction model for 
the occurrence of severe AKI in septic patients. The C-index of the prediction 
model was 0.723 and 0.735 in the training and validation sets, respectively. The 
AUC for the occurrence of severe AKI at 12, 24, and 48 hours were 0.795 (95%CI 
was 0.782-0.808), 0.792 (95%CI was 0.780-0.805), and 0.775 (95%CI was 
0.762-0.788) in the training set, and the AUC were 0.803 (95%CI was 
0.784-0.823), 0.791 (95%CI was 0.772-0.810), and 0.773 (95%CI was 0.752-0.793) 
in the validation set, respectively. The calibration curves of the two cohorts 
were in good agreement.
CONCLUSIONS: The hour-specific prediction model effectively identifies high-risk 
septic patients for developing severe AKI within 48 hours, aiding clinicians in 
stratifying patients for early therapeutic interventions to improve outcomes.

BACKGROUND: Elderly acute kidney injury (AKI) occurring in the intensive care 
unit (ICU), particularly when caused or accompanied by sepsis, is linked to 
extended hospital stays, increased mortality rates, heightened prevalence of 
chronic diseases, and diminished quality of life. This study primarily utilizes 
a comprehensive critical care database to examine the correlation of albumin 
corrected anion gap (ACAG) levels with short-term prognosis in elderly patients 
with AKI caused or accompanied by sepsis, thus assisting physicians in early 
identification of high-risk patients.
METHODS: This study utilized data from the Medical Information Mart for 
Intensive Care IV (MIMIC-IV, v2.0) database. The patient population was divided 
into death and survival groups based on a 14-day prognosis. Subsequently, the 
entire population was further categorized into a normal ACAG group 
(12-20 mmol/L) and a high ACAG group (> 20 mmol/L) based on ACAG levels. The 
LASSO regression cross-validation method was employed to identify significant 
risk factors for inclusion in multivariate Cox regression analyses. A restricted 
cubic spline (RCS) was then employed to visually represent the correlation 
between ACAG levels and the risk of mortality in patients. Kaplan-Meier curves 
were utilized to plot the cumulative survival rates at 14 and 30 days for both 
patient groups. The robustness of the findings was subsequently evaluated 
through subgroup analyses.
RESULTS: Our study identified a total of 3741 eligible subjects, revealing 
higher all-cause mortality rates at both 14-day and 30-day intervals in the high 
ACAG group compared to the normal ACAG group (χ2 = 87.023, P < 0.001; 
χ2 = 90.508, P < 0.001). Cox regression analysis further demonstrated that an 
elevated ACAG on ICU admission independently posed a risk factor for both 14- 
and 30-day prognosis within this population. In addition, the analysis conducted 
using RCS revealed a non-linear association between the levels of ACAG and the 
risk of mortality at both 14 and 30 days in the patient cohort (χ2 = 18.220, 
P < 0.001; χ2 = 18.360, P < 0.001). The application of Kaplan-Meier analysis 
demonstrated a statistically significant decrease in cumulative survival rates 
among individuals with high ACAG levels (P < 0.001). Subgroup analyses indicated 
that ACAG levels interacted with cerebrovascular disease and acute pancreatitis 
on 14-day mortality (P < 0.05 for interaction).
CONCLUSION: Elevated ACAG levels at ICU admission are an independent risk factor 
for poor short-term prognosis, correlating with increased all-cause mortality at 
14 and 30 days in elderly patients with AKI caused or accompanied by sepsis. 
This highlights the importance of monitoring ACAG in critically ill patients to 
identify those at higher risk of adverse outcomes early.

OBJECTIVES: Acute kidney injury (AKI) is common following cardiac surgery. The 
aim was to investigate the characteristics of AKI that occurred within 48 h and 
during 48 h to 7 days after cardiac surgery.
METHODS: Patient data were extracted from Medical Information Mart for Intensive 
Care III database. AKI was defined according to the Kidney Disease Improving 
Global Outcomes guideline and divided into early (within 48 h) and late (during 
48 h to 7 days) AKI. Multivariable logistic regression models were established 
to investigate risk factors for AKI. Cox proportional hazards model was used to 
analyse 90-day survival.
RESULTS: AKI occurred in 51.2% (2741/5356) patients within the first 7 days 
following cardiac surgery, with the peak occurrence at 36-48 h. The incidence of 
early and late AKI was 41.9% and 9.2%, respectively. Patients with late AKI were 
older and had more comorbidities compared to early AKI patients. Risk factors 
associated with early AKI included age, body mass index, congestive heart 
failure and diabetes. While late AKI was related to atrial fibrillation, 
estimated glomerular filtration rate, sepsis, norepinephrine, mechanical 
ventilation and packed red blood cell transfusion. In Cox proportional model, 
both late and early AKIs were independently associated with 90-day mortality, 
and patients with early AKI had better survival than those with late AKI.
CONCLUSIONS: AKI that occurred earlier was distinguishable from AKI that 
occurred later after cardiac surgery. Time frame should be taken into 
consideration.

BACKGROUND: Neutrophil plays a pivotal role in the management of Klebsiella 
pneumoniae infection. Delineate the clinical characteristics and prognostic 
utility of neutrophil in severe patients with K. pneumoniae infection are 
crucial for clinical management and prognostic assessment.
METHODS: K. pneumoniae patients with different infection sites were enrolled 
from Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care IV and eICU Collaborative 
Research Database. Temporal variations of neutrophil counts within 30 days of 
clinical onset were examined using locally weighted scatterplot smoothing 
curves. Logistic regression analysis was performed to assess the relationship 
between neutrophil counts and hospital mortality.
RESULTS: A total of 1,705 patients caused by K. pneumonia were included in the 
study. The non-survivor group exhibited a comparatively older age and a higher 
proportion of K. pneumoniae infections originating from respiratory and 
bloodstream sources compared to the survivor group (38.4% vs 21.1%, p<0.0001, 
and 15.1% vs 10.3%, p=0.021). Patients combined with multiple drug resistance 
strains, respiratory infection, liver disease, and above 60 years exhibited a 
specific dynamic process of neutrophil levels. Neutrophils counts peaked at 
admission and 1-2 weeks later. There was a 'U'-shaped relationship between 
neutrophil counts and hospital mortality.
CONCLUSIONS: Neutrophils in K. pneumoniae infected patients have distinctive 
features and dynamic clinical trajectories. Close monitoring of severe patients 
infected with K. pneumoniae upon admission and during the first 1-2 weeks after 
admission is of utmost importance, particularly for patients with a neutrophil 
count exceeding 8.0×109/L.

(MIMIC-III) database who simultaneously fulfilled Sepsis 3.0 and Agency for 
Healthcare Research and Quality (AHRQ) criteria at ICU admission were 
incorporated. We employed both extreme gradient boosting (XGBoost) and stepwise 
logistic regression model to predict the in-hospital mortality among patients 
with postoperative sepsis. Consequently, the model performance was assessed from 
the angles of discrimination and calibration. Results: We included 3,713 
patients who fulfilled our inclusion criteria, in which 397 (10.7%) patients 
died during hospitalization, and 3,316 (89.3%) patients survived through 
discharge. Fluid-electrolyte disturbance, coagulopathy, renal replacement 
therapy (RRT), urine output, and cardiovascular surgery were important features 
related to the in-hospital mortality. The XGBoost model had a better performance 
in both discriminatory ability (c-statistics, 0.835 vs. 0.737 and 0.621, 
respectively; AUPRC, 0.418 vs. 0.280 and 0.237, respectively) and goodness of 
fit (visualized by calibration curve) compared to the stepwise logistic 
regression model and baseline model. Conclusion: XGBoost model has a better 
performance in predicting hospital mortality among patients with postoperative 
sepsis in comparison to the stepwise logistic regression model. Machine 
learning-based algorithm might have significant application in the development 
of early warning system for septic patients following major operations.

OBJECTIVES: We investigated the impact of obesity (proxied as body mass index 
(BMI)), on short- and long-term mortality in sepsis patients.
METHODS: We conducted a retrospective analysis with adult sepsis ICU patients in 
a US medical institution from 2001 to 2012 in the MIMIC-III database. The WHO 
BMI categories were used. Multivariate logistic regression assessed the 
relationships between BMI and 30-day and 1-year mortality.
RESULTS: In total, 5563 patients were enrolled. Obese patients tended to be 
younger (P<0.001), to be female (P<0.001), to acquire worse SOFA scores 
(P<0.001), and to receive more aggressive treatment compared with their normal 
weight counterparts. Obese patients had notably longer mechanical ventilation 
periods and ICU and hospital lengths of stay (LOSs). In the final model, 
overweight and obese patients had lower 30-day (OR 0.77, 95% CI 0.66-0.91; OR 
0.65, 95% CI 0.56-0.77, respectively) and 1-year (OR 0.83, 95% CI 0.71-0.96; OR 
0.70, 95% CI 0.60-0.81, respectively) mortality risks than normal weight 
patients. In contrast, underweight patients had worse 30-day and 1-year outcomes 
compared with normal weight patients (P=0.01, P<0.001, respectively). In 
morbidly obese, severe sepsis and septic shock patients, obesity remained 
protective.
CONCLUSIONS: Obesity was correlated with short- and long-term survival 
advantages in sepsis patients.

BACKGROUND: Sepsis is a common critical illness in intensive care unit (ICU) and 
seriously threatens the life of patients. Therefore, to identify a simple and 
effective clinical indicator to determine prognosis is essential for the 
management of sepsis patients. This study was mainly based on blood urea 
nitrogen to albumin ratio (B/A), a comprehensive index, to explore its 
correlation with the prognosis of sepsis patients during hospitalization.
METHODS: Totally, adult patients in ICU who were diagnosed with sepsis in 
Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care IV(MIMIC-IV) database from 2008 to 
2019 were involved in this study. The study population were divided into 
survivors group and non-survivors group based on the prognosis during 
hospitalization. Restricted cubic spline (RCS) was utilized to analyze the 
association between B/A level and the risk of ICU all-cause mortality in 
patients with sepsis and determine the optimal cut-off value of B/A. The study 
population was divided into low B/A group and high B/A group based on the 
optimal cut-off value. The survival curve of ICU cumulative survival rate was 
draw through Kaplan-Meier method. The correlation between B/A and the prognosis 
of patients was conducted by multivariate Cox regression analysis. Furthermore, 
we performed sensitivity analyses to assess the robustness of the results.
RESULTS: A total of 10,578 patients with sepsis were enrolled, and the ICU 
all-cause mortality was 15.89%. The patients in the non-survivors group had 
higher B/A values and more comorbidities than those in the survivors group. RCS 
showed that the risk of ICU all-cause mortality increased with the B/A level, 
showing a non-linear trend (χ2 = 66.82, p < 0.001). The mortality rate in the 
high B/A group was significantly higher than that in the low B/A group 
(p < 0.001). Kaplan-Meier curves revealed that compared with the low B/A group, 
the ICU cumulative survival rate of patients with sepsis was significantly lower 
in the high B/A group (log-rank test, χ2 = 148.620, p < 0.001). Further analysis 
of multivariate Cox proportional hazards regression showed that an elevated B/A 
(≥ 7.93) was an independent factor associated with ICU mortality among patients 
with sepsis.
CONCLUSIONS: An elevated B/A might be a useful prognostic indicator in patients 
with sepsis. This study could offer a deeper insight into treating sepsis.

OBJECTIVE: To develop and evaluate a nomogram prediction model for the 3-month 
mortality risk of patients with sepsis-associated acute kidney injury (S-AKI).
METHODS: Based on the American Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care- IV 
(MIMIC- IV), clinical data of S-AKI patients from 2008 to 2021 were collected. 
Initially, 58 relevant predictive factors were included, with all-cause 
mortality within 3 months as the outcome event. The data were divided into 
training and testing sets at a 7 : 3 ratio. In the training set, univariate 
Logistic regression analysis was used for preliminary variable screening. 
Multicollinearity analysis, Lasso regression, and random forest algorithm were 
employed for variable selection, combined with the clinical application value of 
variables, to establish a multivariable Logistic regression model, visualized 
using a nomogram. In the testing set, the predictive value of the model was 
evaluated through internal validation. The receiver operator characteristic 
curve (ROC curve) was drawn, and the area under the curve (AUC) was calculated 
to evaluate the discrimination of nomogram model and Oxford acute severity of 
illness score (OASIS), sequential organ failure assessment (SOFA), and systemic 
inflammatory response syndrome score (SIRS). The calibration curve was used to 
evaluate the calibration, and decision curve analysis (DCA) was performed to 
assess the net benefit at different probability thresholds.
RESULTS: Based on the survival status at 3 months after diagnosis, patients were 
divided into 7 768 (68.54%) survivors and 3 566 (31.46%) death. In the training 
set, after multiple screenings, 7 variables were finally included in the 
nomogram model: Logistic organ dysfunction system (LODS), Charlson comorbidity 
index, urine output, international normalized ratio (INR), respiratory support 
mode, blood urea nitrogen, and age. Internal validation in the testing set 
showed that the AUC of nomogram model was 0.81 [95% confidence interval (95%CI) 
was 0.80-0.82], higher than the OASIS score's 0.70 (95%CI was 0.69-0.71) and 
significantly higher than the SOFA score's 0.57 (95%CI was 0.56-0.58) and SIRS 
score's 0.56 (95%CI was 0.55-0.57), indicating good discrimination. The 
calibration curve demonstrated that the nomogram model's calibration was better 
than the OASIS, SOFA, and SIRS scores. The DCA curve suggested that the nomogram 
model's clinical net benefit was better than the OASIS, SOFA, and SIRS scores at 
different probability thresholds.
CONCLUSIONS: A nomogram prediction model for the 3-month mortality risk of S-AKI 
patients, based on clinical big data from MIMIC- IV and including seven 
variables, demonstrates good discriminative ability and calibration, providing 
an effective new tool for assessing the prognosis of S-AKI patients.

OBJECTIVE: In addition to its antiplatelet and anti-inflammatory properties, 
aspirin inhibits bacterial proliferation directly. The potential benefits of 
aspirin may enhance the prognosis for sepsis patients. However, little is known 
about the effects of early aspirin administration. This study aimed to examine 
the correlation between the administration of aspirin at an early stage and the 
90-day mortality rate among sepsis patients.
METHODS: In order to distinguish between septic patients who received early 
aspirin treatment and those who did not, queries were conducted on the Medical 
Information Mart for Intensive Care IV (MIMIC-IV) database. The principal metric 
utilized was 90-day mortality. We determined the association between early 
aspirin use and 90-day mortality using multivariate Cox regression, and 
propensity score matching (PSM) was utilized to validate our findings. The 
analyses of the subgroups have been completed.
RESULTS: Our analysis comprised 28,425 septic patients, of whom 7,568 (26.6%) 
received aspirin within 24 h of intensive care unit (ICU) admission. The aspirin 
users group had a lower 90-day mortality than the aspirin nonusers group [1,624 
(21.8%) vs. 2,035 (27.3%), P < 0.001]. The logistic regression showed that early 
aspirin use was associated with a lower 90-day mortality (OR, 0.74, 95% CI, 
0.69-0.80, P < 0.001). K-M curve analysis showed that the 90-day mortality of 
the aspirin users group was significantly lower than that of the aspirin 
nonusers group (P < 0.001). Subgroup analysis revealed comparable relationships 
between early aspirin use and 90-day mortality among individuals.
CONCLUSION: In conclusion, early aspirin use was associated with decreased 
in-hospital and 90-day mortality in septic patients, emphasizing the 
significance of early aspirin use administration in the ICU.

Identifying the Phenotypes of Sepsis that will Benefit from Red Blood Cell 
Transfusion Using Unsupervised Cluster Analysis.

Yu H, Zhang H, Lang Y, Li S, Wan X.

BACKGROUND: Sepsis is a heterogeneous syndrome. Previous studies have shown 
controversial results of the effects of red blood cell transfusion (RBC) on the 
clinical outcomes of septic patients. This study aimed to identify the 
phenotypes of sepsis that will benefit from RBC transfusion.
METHODS: Clinical data were extracted from the Medical Information Mart for 
Intensive Care III database. The study population included adult (age ≥ 18 
years) septic patients with moderate non-bleeding anemia (hemoglobin ≤ 10 g/dL) 
within 24 hours after admission to the intensive care unit (ICU) between 2001 
and 2012. After data preprocessing, partitioning around medoids function was 
used for unsupervised cluster analysis. We used Kaplan-Meier survival analysis 
and multivariable Cox proportional hazard models to explore the relationship 
between RBC transfusion and mortality.
RESULTS: In total, 6,821 septic patients with moderate non-bleeding anemia 
within 24 hours after ICU admission, and 3,874 patients (56.8%) received RBC 
transfusion during their stay in the ICU. Using unsupervised cluster analysis, 
we identified three phenotypes of septic patients with moderate non-bleeding 
anemia: cluster A (n = 1,835) was characterized by advanced age and heart 
issues; cluster B (n = 3,043) was characterized by mild disease and relatively 
high hemoglobin levels; and cluster C (n = 1,943) was characterized by severe 
disease, low mean arterial pressure, bloodstream infection, coagulopathy, high 
lactate levels, and high mortality. Only for patients in cluster C, RBC 
transfusion exhibited protective effects in terms of the 14-day [hazard ratio 
(HR), 0.50; 95% confidence interval (CI), 0.41 - 0.61; p < 0.001], 28-day (HR, 
0.61; 95% CI, 0.51 - 0.72; p < 0.001), and 90-day (HR, 0.67; 95% CI, 0.58 - 
0.78; p < 0.001) mortality after adjusting the confounding variables.
CONCLUSIONS: Utilizing unsupervised cluster analysis, we identified three 
phenotypes of septic patients with moderate non-bleeding anemia who had 
different responses to RBC transfusion. In the future, randomized controlled 
trials about prognostic outcomes of RBC transfusions can focus on the specific 
phenotype of sepsis.

Neonatal sepsis, a blood infection occurring in infants younger than 90 days 
old, represents a significant source of mortality and morbidity among infants.1 
Mortality rates increase with postnatal age and can be as high as 52% (36% in 
newborns aged 8-14 days and 52% in those aged 15-28 days).2 While sepsis in 
adults has a generally accepted definition, the definition for clinical 
diagnosis in infants is less well defined. Using the Medical Information Mart 
for Intensive Care database (MIMIC-III), patient diagnoses and microbiology 
results records were processed with an artificial neural network trained using 
unsupervised learning known as a self-organizing map (SOM). The results of this 
feasibility study suggest a low degree of overlap between the presentation of 
sepsis in neonate and adult intensive care unit populations. As a consequence, 
it supports the need for dedicated research in neonatal sepsis, which may 
manifest differently than adult sepsis.

BACKGROUND: Sepsis is a serious disease with high clinical morbidity and 
mortality. Despite the tremendous advances in medicine and nursing, treatment of 
sepsis remains a huge challenge. Our purpose was to explore the effects of shock 
index (SI) trajectory changes on the prognosis of patients within 24 h after the 
diagnosis of sepsis.
METHODS: This study was based on Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care IV 
(MIMIC- IV). The effects of SI on the prognosis of patients with sepsis were 
investigated using C-index and restricted cubic spline (RCS). The trajectory of 
SI in 24 h after sepsis diagnosis was classified by latent growth mixture 
modeling (LGMM). Cox proportional hazard model, double robust analysis, and 
subgroup analysis were conducted to investigate the influence of SI trajectory 
on in-hospital death and secondary outcomes.
RESULTS: A total of 19,869 patients were eventually enrolled in this study. 
C-index showed that SI had a prognostic value independent of Sequential Organ 
Failure Assessment for patients with sepsis. Moreover, the results of RCS showed 
that SI was a prognostic risk factor. LGMM divided SI trajectory into seven 
classes, and patients with sepsis in different classes had notable differences 
in prognosis. Compared with the SI continuously at a low level of 0.6, the SI 
continued to be at a level higher than 1.0, and the patients in the class whose 
initial SI was at a high level of 1.2 and then declined had a worse prognosis. 
Furthermore, the trajectory of SI had a higher prognostic value than the initial 
SI.
CONCLUSION: Both initial SI and trajectory of SI were found to be independent 
factors that affect the prognosis of patients with sepsis. Therefore, in 
clinical treatment, we should closely monitor the basic vital signs of patients 
and arrive at appropriate clinical decisions on basis of their change 
trajectory.

Inflammatory response is a natural protective response in infection or injury. 
The immune imbalance of rheumatoid arthritis (RA) patients and the use of 
anti-rheumatic immune drugs may affect the inflammatory response process of 
shock. The evidence of the impact of RA on short-time mortality in shock 
patients is limited. This study was a retrospective observational study from the 
Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care IV database (MIMIC-IV). Patients 
diagnosed with shock were selected from the database. The primary outcome was 
in-hospital mortality. Binary logistic regression analysis was used to explore 
the association between RA and in-hospital mortality. Subgroup analysis of the 
association between in-hospital mortality and RA was performed in septic shock, 
cardiogenic shock, and other types of shock. A total of 8233 ICU patients with 
shock were identified. After adjusting for confounding variables, RA was 
associated with a lower risk of in-hospital mortality (OR, 0.58; 95% CI, 
0.38-0.91). The results of the subgroup analysis showed that RA was associated 
with a decreased risk of in-hospital death in the septic shock group but not in 
cardiogenic shock or other types of shock. RA was associated with a lower risk 
of in-hospital death in shock patients. This association was only observed in 
septic shock but not in cardiogenic shock and other types of shock. Key Points 
• Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is associated with a lower risk of in-hospital 
mortality in ICU patients with shock, particularly in those with septic shock. 
• This study utilized propensity score matching to accurately compare outcomes 
between RA and non-RA shock patients, ensuring balanced baseline 
characteristics. • Findings suggest that the immune modulation inherent to RA or 
the impact of anti-rheumatic drugs might influence the survival outcomes in 
shock scenarios. • The protective effect of RA on in-hospital mortality was not 
observed in patients with cardiogenic shock or other types of shock, indicating 
a specific interaction in septic shock contexts.

BACKGROUND: Sex-stratified medicine is an important aspect of precision 
medicine. We aimed to compare the incidence and risk factors of acute kidney 
injury (AKI) for critically ill men and women with sepsis. Furthermore, the 
short-term mortality was compared between men and women with sepsis associated 
acute kidney injury (SA-AKI).
METHOD: This was a retrospective study based on the Medical Information Mart for 
Intensive Care IV database. We used the multivariable logistic regression 
analysis to evaluate the independent effect of sex on the incidence of SA-AKI. 
We further applied three machine learning methods (decision tree, random forest 
and extreme gradient boosting) to screen for the risk factors associated with 
SA-AKI in the total, men and women groups. We finally compared the intensive 
care unit (ICU) and hospital mortality between men and women with SA-AKI using 
propensity score matching.
RESULTS: A total of 6463 patients were included in our study, including 3673 men 
and 2790 women. The incidence of SA-AKI was 83.8% for men and 82.1% for women. 
After adjustment for confounders, no significant association was observed 
between sex and the incidence of SA-AKI (odds ratio (OR), 1.137; 95% confidence 
interval (CI), 0.949-1.361; p=0.163). The machine learning results revealed that 
body mass index, Oxford Acute Severity of Illness Score, diuretic, Acute 
Physiology Score III and age were the most important risk factors of SA-AKI, 
irrespective of sex. After propensity score matching, men had similar ICU and 
hospital mortality to women.
CONCLUSIONS: The incidence and associated risk factors of SA-AKI are similar 
between men and women, and men and women with SA-AKI experience comparable rates 
of ICU and hospital mortality. Therefore, sex-related effects may play a minor 
role in developing SA-AKI. Our study helps to contribute to the knowledge gap 
between sex and SA-AKI.

Background: Sepsis is a serious public health problem worldwide. Blood pressure 
is one of the indicators that is closely monitored in intensive-care units, and 
it reflects complex interactions between the internal cardiovascular control 
mechanism and the external environment. We aimed to determine the impact of 
indicators related to the ambulatory blood pressure on the prognosis of sepsis 
patients. Methods: This retrospective study was based on the Medical Information 
Mart for Intensive Care IV database. Relevant information about sepsis patients 
was extracted according to specific inclusion and exclusion criteria. Examined 
parameters included the average blood pressure, blood pressure variability 
(BPV), and circadian rhythm, and the study outcome was in-hospital death. We 
investigated the effects of these indicators on the risk of in-hospital death 
among sepsis patients using Cox proportional-hazards models, restricted cubic 
splines analysis, and subgroup analysis. Results: This study enrolled 10,316 
sepsis patients, among whom 2,117 died during hospitalization. All parameters 
except the nighttime variation coefficient of the diastolic blood pressure (DBP) 
were associated with in-hospital death of sepsis patients. All parameters except 
for fluctuations in DBP exhibited nonlinear correlations with the outcome. The 
subgroup analysis revealed that some of the examined parameters were associated 
with in-hospital death only in certain subgroups. Conclusion: Indicators related 
to the ambulatory blood pressure within 24 h are related to the prognosis of 
sepsis patients. When treating sepsis, in addition to blood pressure, attention 
should also be paid to BPV and the circadian rhythm in order to improve the 
prognosis and the survival rate.

OBJECTIVE: To investigate the value of machine learning methods for predicting 
in-hospital mortality in trauma patients with acute respiratory distress 
syndrome (ARDS).
METHODS: A retrospective non-intervention case-control study was performed. 
Trauma patients with ARDS met the Berlin definition were extracted from the the 
Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care III (MIMIC III) database. The basic 
information [including gender, age, body mass index (BMI), pH, oxygenation 
index, laboratory indexes, length of stay in the intensive care unit (ICU), the 
proportion of mechanical ventilation (MV) or continuous renal replacement 
therapy (CRRT), acute physiology score III (APS III), sequential organ failure 
score (SOFA) and simplified acute physiology score II (SAPS II)], complications 
(including hypertension, diabetes, infection, acute hemorrhagic anemia, sepsis, 
shock, acidosis and pneumonia) and prognosis data of patients were collected. 
Multivariate Logistic regression analysis was used to screen meaningful 
variables (P < 0.05). Logistic regression model, XGBoost model and artificial 
neural network model were constructed, and the receiver operator characteristic 
curve (ROC) was performed to evaluate the predictive value of the three models 
for in-hospital mortality in trauma patients with ARDS.
RESULTS: A total of 760 trauma patients with ARDS were enrolled, including 346 
mild cases, 301 moderate cases and 113 severe cases; 618 cases survived and 142 
cases died in hospital; 736 cases received MV and 65 cases received CRRT. 
Multivariate Logistic regression analysis screened out significant variables, 
including age [odds ratio (OR) = 1.035, 95% confidence interval (95%CI) was 
1.020-1.050, P < 0.001], BMI (OR = 0.949, 95%CI was 0.917-0.983, P = 0.003), 
blood urea nitrogen (BUN; OR = 1.019, 95%CI was 1.004-1.033, P = 0.010), lactic 
acid (Lac; OR = 1.213, 95%CI was 1.124-1.309, P < 0.001), red cell volume 
distribution width (RDW; OR = 1.249, 95%CI was 1.102-1.416, P < 0.001), 
hematocrit (HCT, OR = 1.057, 95%CI was 1.019-1.097, P = 0.003), hypertension (OR 
= 0.614, 95%CI was 0.389-0.968, P = 0.036), infection (OR = 0.463, 95%CI was 
0.289-0.741, P = 0.001), acute renal failure (OR = 2.021, 95%CI was 1.267-3.224, 
P = 0.003) and sepsis (OR = 2.105, 95%CI was 1.265-3.502, P = 0.004). All the 
above variables were used to construct the model. Logistic regression model, 
XGBoost model and artificial neural network model predicted in-hospital 
mortality with area under the curve (AUC) of 0.737 (95%CI was 0.659-0.815), 
0.745 (95%CI was 0.672-0.819) and 0.757 (95%CI was 0.680-0.884), respectively. 
There was no significant difference between any two models (all P > 0.05).
CONCLUSIONS: Logistic regression model, XGBoost model and artificial neural 
network model including age, BMI, BUN, Lac, RDW, HCT, hypertension, infection, 
acute renal failure and sepsis have good predictive value for in-hospital 
mortality of trauma patients with ARDS.

Sepsis-related mortality rates are high among elderly patients, especially those 
in intensive care units (ICUs). Early prediction of the prognosis of sepsis is 
critical, as prompt and effective treatment can improve prognosis. Researchers 
have predicted mortality and the development of sepsis using machine learning 
algorithms; however, few studies specifically focus on elderly patients with 
sepsis. This paper proposes a viable model for early prediction of in-hospital 
mortality among elderly patients diagnosed with sepsis. We extracted patient 
information from the Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care IV database. We 
employed several machine learning algorithms to predict the in-hospital 
mortality of elderly ICU patients with sepsis. The performance of the model was 
evaluated by using the AUROC and F1 score. Furthermore, the SHAP algorithm was 
used to explain the model, analyze how the individual features affect the model 
output, and visualize the Shapley value for a single individual. Our study 
included 18522 elderly patients, with a mortality of 15.4%. After screening, 59 
clinical variables were extracted to develop models. Feature importance analysis 
showed that age, PO2, RDW, SPO2, WBC, and urine output were significantly 
related to the in-hospital mortality. According to the results of AUROC (0.871 
(95% CI: 0.854-0.888)) and F1 score (0.547 (95% CI: 0.539-0.661)) analyses, the 
extreme gradient boosting (XGBoost) model outperformed the other models (i.e., 
LGBM, LR, RF, DT, and KNN). Furthermore, SHAP force analysis illustrated how the 
constructed model visualized the individualized prediction of death. XGBoost 
machine learning framework gives good in-hospital mortality prediction of 
elderly patients with sepsis and can maximize prediction model accuracy. The 
XGBoost model could be an effective tool to assist doctors in identifying 
high-risk cases of in-hospital mortality among elderly patients with sepsis. 
This could be used to create a clinical decision support system in the future.

BACKGROUND & AIMS: There was considerable debate regarding the effect of statins 
administration on the outcome of septic patients. This retrospective study aimed 
to assess the association between statins administration and mortality in sepsis 
patients and investigate whether this association differed according to the 
types of statins.
METHODS: We performed a retrospective study based on the electronic ICU 
Collaborative Research Database, Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care 
Database, and the Amsterdam University Medical Centers Database. The 
participants with sepsis were divided as two groups, statins group and 
non-statins group. The primary endpoint was the all-cause mortality. We utilized 
logistic regression, propensity score matching (PSM), and sub-analysis to assess 
the association between statins administration and outcome in patients with 
sepsis.
RESULTS: A total of 19,327 sepsis patients were enrolled. Among these, 3,721 
patients were prescribed statins. Pooled analyses of three databases showed that 
statin users had a decreased risk of mortality in sepsis as compared with 
nonusers (OR 0.73, 95% CI 0.66-0.80, P < 0.001). Sub-analysis of statin showed 
that atorvastatin had the most distinct effectiveness in decreasing mortality 
(OR 0.67, 95% CI 0.59-0.76, P = 0.035), whereas pravastatin, simvastatin, and 
rosuvastatin were not. PSM analysis confirmed these findings for statins (OR 
0.75, 95% CI 0.67-0.84, P < 0.001) and atorvastatin (OR 0.70, 95% CI 0.59-0.82, 
P < 0.001).
CONCLUSIONS: The use of statins could decrease the risk of mortality in patients 
with sepsis during the hospital period. Among different types of statins, 
atorvastatin showed the most significant trend to reduce the risk of mortality 
in patients with sepsis.

BACKGROUND: The relationship between baseline hemoglobin levels and in-hospital 
mortality in septic patients remains unclear. This study aimed to clarify this 
association in critically ill patients with sepsis.
METHODS: Patients with sepsis were retrospectively identified from the Medical 
Information Mart for Intensive Care-IV (MIMIC-IV 2.2) and eICU Collaborative 
Research Database (eICU-CRD). Multivariate logistic regression analysis and 
restricted cubic spline regression were used to investigate the association 
between hemoglobin and the risk of in-hospital mortality. Additionally, a 
two-part linear regression model was used to determine threshold effects. 
Stratified analyses were also performed.
RESULTS: A total of 21,946 patients from MIMIC-IV and 15,495 patients from 
eICU-CRD were included in the study. In-hospital mortality was 14.95% in 
MIMIC-IV and 17.40% in eICU-CRD. Multivariate logistic regression showed that 
hemoglobin was significantly and nonlinearly associated with the risk of 
in-hospital mortality after adjusting for other covariates. Furthermore, we 
found a nonlinear association between hemoglobin and in-hospital mortality, with 
mortality plateauing at 10.2 g/dL. The risk of mortality decreased with 
increasing hemoglobin levels below 10.2 g/dL but increased when hemoglobin 
levels exceeded 10.2 g/dL. These findings were validated in the eICU-CRD 
dataset.
CONCLUSIONS: A nonlinear correlation between hemoglobin levels and in-hospital 
mortality was observed in patients with sepsis, with a threshold of 10.2 g/DL. 
These findings suggested that hemoglobin levels below or above the threshold may 
be associated with worse outcomes, warranting further investigation in 
prospective studies.

OBJECTIVE: Cellulitis is the most common cause of skin-related hospitalisations, 
and the mortality of patients with sepsis remains high. Some stratification 
models have been developed, but their performance in external validation has 
been unsatisfactory. This study was designed to develop and compare different 
models for predicting patients with cellulitis developing sepsis during 
hospitalisation.
DESIGN: This is a retrospective cohort study.
SETTING: This study included both the development and the external-validation 
phases from two independent large cohorts internationally.
PARTICIPANTS AND METHODS: A total of 6695 patients with cellulitis in the 
Medical Information Mart for Intensive care (MIMIC)-IV database were used to 
develop models with different machine-learning algorithms. The best models were 
selected and then externally validated in 2506 patients with cellulitis from the 
YiduCloud database of our university. The performances and robustness of 
selected models were further compared in the external-validation group by area 
under the curve (AUC), diagnostic accuracy, sensitivity, specificity and 
diagnostic OR.
PRIMARY OUTCOME MEASURES: The primary outcome of interest in this study was the 
development based on the Sepsis-3.0 criteria during hospitalisation.
RESULTS: Patient characteristics were significantly different between the two 
groups. In internal validation, XGBoost was the best model, with an AUC of 
0.780, and AdaBoost was the worst model, with an AUC of 0.585. In external 
validation, the AUC of the artificial neural network (ANN) model was the 
highest, 0.830, while the AUC of the logistic regression (LR) model was the 
lowest, 0.792. The AUC values changed less in the boosting and ANN models than 
in the LR model when variables were deleted.
CONCLUSIONS: Boosting and neural network models performed slightly better than 
the LR model and were more robust in complex clinical situations. The results 
could provide a tool for clinicians to detect hospitalised patients with 
cellulitis developing sepsis early.

Background: So far, no study has investigated the effects of plasma transfusion 
in the patients with sepsis, especially in the terms of prognosis. Therefore, we 
aimed to explore the association of early fresh frozen plasma (FFP) transfusion 
with the outcomes of patients with sepsis. Methods: We performed a cohort study 
using data extracted from the Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care III 
database (v1.4). External validation was obtained from the First Affiliated 
Hospital of Wenzhou Medical University, China. We adopted the Sepsis-3 criteria 
to extract the patients with sepsis and septic shock. The occurrence of 
transfusion during the first 3-days of intensive care unit (ICU) stay was 
regarded as early FFP transfusion. The primary outcome was 28-day mortality. We 
assessed the association of early FFP transfusion with the patient outcomes 
using a Cox regression analysis. Furthermore, we performed the sensitivity 
analysis, subset analysis, and external validation to verify the true strength 
of the results. Results: After adjusting for the covariates in the three models, 
respectively, the significantly higher risk of death in the FFP transfusion 
group at 28-days [e.g., Model 2: hazard ratio (HR) = 1.361, P = 0.018, 95% CI = 
1.054-1.756] and 90-days (e.g., Model 2: HR = 1.368, P = 0.005, 95% CI = 
1.099-1.704) remained distinct. Contrarily, the mortality increased 
significantly with the increase of FFP transfusion volume. The outcomes of the 
patients with sepsis with hypocoagulable state after early FFP transfusion were 
not significantly improved. Similar results can also be found in the subset 
analysis of the septic shock cohort. The results of external validation 
exhibited good consistency. Conclusions: Our study provides a new understanding 
of the rationale and effectiveness of FFP transfusion for the patients with 
sepsis. After recognizing the evidence of risk-benefit and cost-benefit, it is 
important to reduce the inappropriate use of FFP and avoid unnecessary adverse 
transfusion reactions.

BACKGROUND: We attempted to determine the predictive ability of the first-day 
Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (SOFA) score in the cardiac intensive care 
unit, as well as a new score combining the anion gap (AG) with the SOFA score 
(SOFA-AG).
METHODS: Information was obtained from the Medical Information Mart for 
Intensive Care III (MIMIC III 1.4) database. We plotted the relationship between 
the maximum first-day AG and 90-day mortality after admission to the care unit. 
Patients were divided into five groups based on the hazard ratio (HR) and 
assigned scores of 0, 1, 2, 3, or 4 points. We compared the area under the curve 
(AUC) for the receiver-operating characteristic curve of the SOFA and that of 
the SOFA-AG.
RESULTS: A total of 1316 patients were identified and divided into the following 
five groups: AG 8 to <16 mmol/L; AG 16 to <17 mmol/L; AG 17 to <19 mmol/L; AG 19 
to <21 mmol/L; and AG ≥ 21 mmol/L. The SOFA-AG score had a greater AUC than the 
SOFA score at 7 days (0.770 vs. 0.711; P < 0.001), 14 days (0.751 vs. 0.692; 
P < 0.001), 28 days (0.741 vs. 0.684; P < 0.001), and 90 days (0.727 vs. 0.667; 
P < 0.001).
CONCLUSIONS: The SOFA score showed moderate predictive value only for 7-day 
mortality after admission to the cardiac intensive care unit, but the SOFA-AG 
score had improved predictive ability for up to 90 days after admission.

BACKGROUND: Fluid supplement may be affected by ventilatory management due to 
physiological interaction between heart and lung. The aim of the present study 
was to explore the effects of ventilator strategies on the relationship of fluid 
balance and hospital mortality for sepsis patients.
METHODS: This was a retrospective cohort study included sepsis patients with 
invasive mechanical ventilation (MV) over 24 h from Medical Information Mart for 
Intensive Care (MIMIC) IV database. The accumulative fluid balance increased by 
6 h intervals were calculated as fluid intake minus fluid output. The modes 
(assisted or controlled) and levels (high or low) of positive end-expiratory 
pressure (PEEP) of MV every 6 h were recorded. The modification effect for modes 
and levels of PEEP on the relationship of fluid balance and hospital mortality 
were tested by multivariable regression models, respectively.
RESULTS: A total of 4466 sepsis patients with invasive MV were included, of 
which hospital mortality was 26.5%. Fluid balance seemed to have U-shape 
relationship with hospital mortality. The majority of patients used controlled 
ventilation at the beginning, and switched to assisted ventilation gradually; 
however, the PEEP level did not change a lot during the first 24 h. The 
relationship between fluid balance and hospital mortality was not modified by 
the ventilator mode; while the PEEP level may modify the relationship.
CONCLUSIONS: For sepsis patients admitted to ICU with invasive MV, the PEEP 
level, but not the mode of MV, appeared to modify the relationship of fluid 
balance and hospital mortality. The setting of mechanical ventilation may be an 
important consideration for fluid therapy.

The incidence of sepsis-induced coagulopathy (SIC) is high, leading to increased 
mortality rates and prolonged hospitalization and intensive care unit (ICU) 
stays. Early identification of SIC patients at risk of in-hospital mortality can 
improve patient prognosis. The objective of this study is to develop and 
validate machine learning (ML) models to dynamically predict in-hospital 
mortality risk in SIC patients. A ML model is established based on the Medical 
Information Mart for Intensive Care IV (MIMIC-IV) database to predict 
in-hospital mortality in SIC patients. Utilizing univariate feature selection 
for feature screening. The optimal model was determined by calculating the area 
under the curve (AUC) with a 95% confidence interval (CI). The optimal model was 
interpreted using Shapley Additive Explanation (SHAP) values. Among the 3112 SIC 
patients included in MIMIC-IV, a total of 757 (25%) patients experienced 
mortality during their ICU stay. Univariate feature selection helps us to pick 
out the 20 most critical variables from the original feature. Among the 10 
developed machine learning models, the stacking ensemble model exhibited the 
highest AUC (0.795, 95% CI: 0.763-0.827). Anion gap and age emerged as the most 
significant features for predicting the mortality risk in SIC. In this study, an 
ML model was constructed that exhibited excellent performance in predicting 
in-hospital mortality risk in SIC patients. Specifically, the stacking ensemble 
model demonstrated superior predictive ability.

Previous studies have shown that lactate/albumin ratio (LAR) can be used as a 
prognostic biomarker to independently predict the mortality of sepsis and severe 
heart failure. However, the role of LAR as an independent prognostic factor in 
all-cause mortality in patients with acute respiratory failure (ARF) remains to 
be clarified. Therefore, we retrospectively analyzed 2170 patients with ARF in 
Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care Database III from 2001 to 2012. By 
drawing the receiver operating characteristic curve, LAR shows a better 
predictive value in predicting the 30-day mortality of ARF patients (AUC: 
0.646), which is higher than that of albumin (AUC: 0.631) or lactate (AUC: 
0.616) alone, and even higher than SOFA score(AUC: 0.642). COX regression 
analysis and Kaplan-Meier curve objectively and intuitively show that high LAR 
is a risk factor for patients with ARF, which is positively correlated with 
all-cause mortality. As an easy-to-obtain and objective biomarker, LAR deserves 
further verification by multi-center prospective studies.

PURPOSE: To identify phenotypes of Intensive Care Unit (ICU) onset sepsis and 
its associated harms of delayed time-to-antibiotics.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: The Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care IV 
(MIMIC-IV) database was employed to identify patients with ICU onset sepsis. The 
primary exposure was time-to-antibiotics, as measured from sepsis recognition to 
first antibiotic administered. Latent profile analysis (LPA) was used to 
identify phenotypes of sepsis based on individual organ failure score derived 
from Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (SOFA). Interactions between phenotypes 
and time-to-antibiotics on 28-day mortality were explored.
RESULTS: 6246 patients were enrolled in final analysis. The overall 28-day 
mortality was 12.7%. Delayed time-to-antibiotics was associated with increased 
28-day mortality in patients with ICU onset sepsis (HR 1.12, 95% CI 1.08-1.18). 
Four phenotypes of sepsis were identified: phenotype 1 was characterized by 
respiratory dysfunction, phenotype 2 was characterized by cardiovascular 
dysfunction, phenotype 3 was characterized by multiple organ dysfunction, and 
phenotype 4 was characterized by neurological dysfunction. The adjusted HR of 
28-day mortality was 1.16 (95% CI 1.08-1.25) in phenotype 1, and 1.06 (95% CI 
1.00-1.13) in phenotype 2, while no significant interaction was observed.
CONCLUSIONS: Septic patients with respiratory or cardiovascular dysfunction were 
associated with harms of delayed time-to-antibiotics.

BACKGROUND: Sepsis is a life-threatening condition characterized by a 
dysregulated host immune response to infection. Currently, stress hyperglycemia 
is frequently associated with an unfavorable prognosis in cardiovascular and 
cerebrovascular disease. During sepsis, the progression of the immune response 
and inflammation often leads to aberrant metabolic indicators. However, the 
association between the stress-induced hyperglycemia ratio (SHR) and sepsis in 
patients admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) remains uncertain.
OBJECTIVES: This study aimed to explore the potential correlation between SHR 
and sepsis.
MATERIAL AND METHODS: In this retrospective cohort study, data were obtained 
from the Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care-IV (MIMIC-IV) database. 
Patients with recorded glucose and glycosylated HbA1c levels within 24-h ICU 
admission were identified. The endpoints of the follow-up period were the 
occurrence of sepsis during ICU stay or ICU discharge. After adjustment for 
factors including demographics, vital signs and biochemical indicators, the 
univariate and multivariate logistic regression model was employed to examine 
the relationship between SHR, baseline blood glucose levels and the risk of 
sepsis. The associations were further explored in subgroups based on age, gender 
and presence/absence of type 2 diabetes.
RESULTS: Of the total 2,161 patients, with the average age of 64.96 ±16.84 
years, 205 (9.49%) had sepsis. After adjustment or confounders, high SHR levels 
were associated with the risk of sepsis odds ratio (OR) = 1.53, 95% confidence 
interval (95% CI): 1.07-2.17). Similar results were found in patients aged ≥65 
years (OR = 1.91, 95% CI: 1.16-3.17), in men (OR = 1.64, 95% CI: 1.02-2.63) and 
patients without type 2 diabetes history (OR = 1.58, 95% CI: 1.01-2.48). The 
baseline blood glucose level did not exhibit a significant association with the 
risk of sepsis.
CONCLUSIONS: Elevated SHR levels were correlated with sepsis. Bedside monitoring 
of SHR may be a valuable tool for clinicians to identify patients at high risk 
of sepsis, and be beneficial to promptly implement clinical interventions.

OBJECTIVES: Sepsis-associated encephalopathy (SAE) has a high incidence and 
mortality, especially for elderly patients and patients who are positive for 
pathogenic microbial infection, this study explored the prognostic factors 
influencing the prognosis of elderly patients with pathogenic microorganisms 
positive of sepsis-associated encephalopathy.
METHODS: Patients with SAE and pathogenic microbiology positive were included in 
this study from Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care IV (MIMIC IV) 
database. The main results of this study was analyzed the 28-day mortality rate 
of patients with pathogenic microorganism positive and SAE by Wilcoxon, 
Kaplan-Meier curve and other methods.
RESULTS: This study found that older patients with SAE had higher mortality at 
28 and 90 days compared with non-older patients with SAE. Klebsiella pneumoniae 
and Pseudomonas aeruginosa infection, the level of APTT and lactate and SAPS III 
score were independent risk factors for 28-day mortality in elderly patients 
with SAE, among them, Klebsiella pneumoniae and Pseudomonas aeruginosa infection 
had the best sensitivity (0.893; 0.931) in assessing elderly patients with 
pathogenic microorganisms positive and SAE; the SAPS III score had the highest 
AUC (0.681) value and specificity (0.761) in assessing elderly patients with 
pathogenic microorganisms positive and SAE.
CONCLUSION: The older patients with SAE had a poor prognosis, the elder patients 
with pathogenic microorganisms positive and SAE with high levels of APTT and 
lactate and SAPS III score and Klebsiella pneumoniae and Pseudomonas aeruginosa 
infection should be closely monitored and treated aggressively.

BACKGROUND: The present study aimed to evaluate the synergistic impact of acute 
heart failure (AHF) and acute kidney injury (AKI) on in-hospital mortality in 
critically ill patients with sepsis.
METHODS: We undertook a retrospective, observational analysis using data 
acquired from the Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care-IV (MIMIC-IV) 
database and eICU Collaborative Research Database (eICU-CRD). The effects of AKI 
and AHF on in-hospital mortality were examined using a Cox proportional hazards 
model. Additive interactions were analyzed using the relative extra risk 
attributable to interaction.
RESULTS: A total of 33,184 patients were eventually included, comprising 20,626 
patients in the training cohort collected from the MIMIC-IV database and 12,558 
patients in the validation cohort extracted from the eICU-CRD database. After 
multivariate Cox analysis, the independent variables for in-hospital mortality 
included: AHF only (HR:1.20, 95% CI:1.02-1.41, P = 0.005), AKI only (HR:2.10, 
95% CI:1.91-2.31, P < 0.001), and both AHF and AKI (HR:3.80, 95%CI:13.40-4.24, P 
< 0.001). The relative excess risk owing to interaction was 1.49 (95% 
CI:1.14-1.87), the attributable percentage due to interaction was 0.39 
(95%CI:0.31-0.46), and the synergy index was 2.15 (95%CI:1.75-2.63), 
demonstrated AHF and AKI had a strong synergic impact on in-hospital mortality. 
And the findings in the validation cohort indicated identical conclusions to the 
training cohort.
CONCLUSION: Our data demonstrated a synergistic relationship of AHF and AKI on 
in-hospital mortality in critically unwell patients with sepsis.

BACKGROUND: The red blood cell distribution width (RDW)-albumin ratio (RA) is a 
new biomarker, which is d-efined as RDW divided by albumin. This study aimed at 
determining the prognostic values of RA for diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA).
METHODS: Data were obtained from Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care 
Database III V1.4 (MIMIC-III) and the RA calculated. Multivariate Cox regression 
analysis was performed to determine the correlation between RA and 90-day 
mortality or 365-day mortality. To further investigate the association with RA 
and mortality, the patients were divided into two groups. The second outcome was 
the association between the incidence of DKA-related infections and RA.
RESULTS: For DKA patients in the ICU, RA was significantly correlated with 
90-day mortality (HR: 2.1, 95% CI: 1.5, 3.0, p < 0.001) and 365-day mortality 
(HR: 1.9, 95% CI: 1.5, 2.5, p < 0.001). A high RA was independently correlated 
with increased 90-day mortality (HR: 7.8, 95% CI: 1.8, 34.0, p for trend <0.001) 
and 365-day mortality (HR: 5.2, 95% CI: 2.4, 11.3, p for trend <0.001). 
Moreover, RA was found to be an independent predictor for sepsis and septic 
shock in patients with DKA (HR: 2.9, 95% CI: 2.0, 4.1, p < 0.001). After 
adjusting for confounders, the statistical outcome was the same.
CONCLUSION: A high RA is significantly correlated with increased all-cause 
mortality of DKA as well as an increased incidence of DKA-related infections. RA 
is a potential prognostic marker for DKA.

BACKGROUND: Early and accurate identification of sepsis patients with high risk 
of in-hospital death can help physicians in intensive care units (ICUs) make 
optimal clinical decisions. This study aimed to develop machine learning-based 
tools to predict the risk of hospital death of patients with sepsis in ICUs.
METHODS: The source database used for model development and validation is the 
medical information mart for intensive care (MIMIC) III. We identified adult 
sepsis patients using the new sepsis definition Sepsis-3. A total of 86 
predictor variables consisting of demographics, laboratory tests and 
comorbidities were used. We employed the least absolute shrinkage and selection 
operator (LASSO), random forest (RF), gradient boosting machine (GBM) and the 
traditional logistic regression (LR) method to develop prediction models. In 
addition, the prediction performance of the four developed models was evaluated 
and compared with that of an existent scoring tool - simplified acute physiology 
score (SAPS) II - using five different performance measures: the area under the 
receiver operating characteristic curve (AUROC), Brier score, sensitivity, 
specificity and calibration plot.
RESULTS: The records of 16,688 sepsis patients in MIMIC III were used for model 
training and test. Amongst them, 2949 (17.7%) patients had in-hospital death. 
The average AUROCs of the LASSO, RF, GBM, LR and SAPS II models were 0.829, 
0.829, 0.845, 0.833 and 0.77, respectively. The Brier scores of the LASSO, RF, 
GBM, LR and SAPS II models were 0.108, 0.109, 0.104, 0.107 and 0.146, 
respectively. The calibration plots showed that the GBM, LASSO and LR models had 
good calibration; the RF model underestimated high-risk patients; and SAPS II 
had the poorest calibration.
CONCLUSION: The machine learning-based models developed in this study had good 
prediction performance. Amongst them, the GBM model showed the best performance 
in predicting the risk of in-hospital death. It has the potential to assist 
physicians in the ICU to perform appropriate clinical interventions for 
critically ill sepsis patients and thus may help improve the prognoses of sepsis 
patients in the ICU.

Sepsis results in various patient complications and is due to a heightened 
inflammatory response against infection. This condition requires further 
exploration of biomarkers. We employed an "in silico" method comprised of 
text-mining and additionally clinical validation through the Medical Information 
Mart for Intensive Care. We highlight that Factor VIII shows potential as a 
pertinent septic shock biomarker.

This retrospective cohort study aimed to evaluate the association between 
pre-existing heart failure and both mortality and the recurrence of sepsis. A 
total of 16,092 sepsis patients without a history of heart failure and 841 
sepsis patients with pre-existing heart failure were identified from the Medical 
Information Mart for Intensive Care version IV (MIMIC-IV ) database. All 
patients were adults admitted to intensive care units, and no specific 
interventions were applied. After matching, Kaplan-Meier survival analysis 
showed significantly poorer long-term survival rates in patients with heart 
failure, both in the original (p < 0.0001) and the matched cohort (p = 0.00059). 
Mortality rates were tracked over different time periods, revealing that the 
mortality disparity became evident after the first year (p = 0.029). Besides, 
the cumulative incidence of sepsis recurrence was substantially higher in 
patients with a history of heart failure (p < 0.001) when deaths without 
recurrence were treated as competing events. Moreover, there was no 
statistically significant difference observed in the deaths without recurrence 
between the two groups (p = 0.251). In conclusion, pre-existing heart failure is 
associated with an increased risk of long-term mortality, which may be partly 
explained by a higher incidence of recurrent sepsis in this population.

BACKGROUND: Sepsis-associated encephalopathy (SAE) is related to increased 
short-term mortality in patients with sepsis. We aim to establish a 
user-friendly nomogram for individual prediction of 30-day risk of mortality in 
patients with SAE.
METHODS: Data were retrospectively retrieved from the Medical Information Mart 
for Intensive Care (MIMIC III) open source clinical database. SAE was defined by 
Glasgow Coma Score (GCS) < 15 or delirium at the presence of sepsis. Prediction 
model with a nomogram was constructed in the training set by logistic regression 
analysis and then undergone internal validation and sensitivity analysis.
RESULTS: SAE accounted for about 50% in patients with sepsis and was 
independently associated with the 30-day mortality of sepsis. Variables eligible 
for the nomogram included patient's age and clinical parameters on the first day 
of ICU admission including the GCS score, lactate, bilirubin, red blood cell 
distribution width (RDW), mean value of respiratory rate and temperature, and 
the use of vasopressor. Compared with Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (SOFA) 
and Logistic Organ Dysfunction System (LODS), the nomogram exhibited better 
discrimination with an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve 
(AUROC) of 0.763 (95%CI 0.736-0.791, p < 0.001) and 0.753 (95%CI 0.713-0.794, p 
< 0.001) in the training and validation sets, respectively. The calibration plot 
revealed an adequate fit of the nomogram for predicting the risk of 30-day 
mortality in both sets. Regarding to clinical usefulness, the DCA of the 
nomogram exhibited greater net benefit than SOFA and LODS in both of the 
training and validation sets. Besides, the nomogram exhibited acceptable 
discrimination, calibration, and clinical usefulness in sensitivity analysis.
CONCLUSIONS: SAE is related to increased 30-day mortality of patients with 
sepsis. The nomogram presents excellent performance in predicting 30-day risk of 
mortality in SAE patients, which can be used to evaluate the prognosis of 
patients with SAE and may be more beneficial once specific treatments towards 
SAE are developed.

BACKGROUND: Whether combining the Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (SOFA) 
score at admission with inflammation-based markers can improve performance of 
prediction and risk stratification of patients with sepsis, compared to use of 
the SOFA score alone, remains unknown.
METHODS: Data from septic patients included in the Medical Information Mart for 
Intensive Care database (MIMIC-IV) database were used for model development and 
internal validation. We developed a predictive nomogram model that included SOFA 
score, Charlson Comorbidity Index (CCI), red cell distribution width (RDW), 
neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio (NLR), lymphocyte-to-monocyte ratio (LMR), and 
mean corpuscular volume (MCV) values. The primary outcome was the performance of 
the risk score.
RESULTS: Data from 4704 septic patients included in the database were used for 
the primary cohort and to build the model. The multivariate analyses included 
SOFA score, CCI, RDW, NLR, LMR, and MCV values. These values were used for 
nomogram model construction. The nomogram model showed good calibration, and had 
better discrimination in terms of area under the receiver operating 
characteristic (AUROC) curve results than use of the SOFA score alone (0.724 
(95% CI: 0.705-0.743) vs. 0.585 (95% CI: 0.562-0.609), respectively; P<0.001). 
It also had better classification in terms of net reclassification improvement 
(20.5% (95% CI: 16.2%-24.7%; P<0.001)) and integrated discrimination improvement 
(6.0% (95% CI: 5.1%-6.8%; P<0.001)). The validation cohort results supported 
these findings.
CONCLUSION: The results suggested that this simple-to-use nomogram model 
provided a relatively accurate risk of death prediction in patients with sepsis.

BACKGROUND: Sepsis is a life-threatening disease accompanied by disorders of the 
coagulation and immune systems. P2Y12 inhibitors, widely used for arterial 
thrombosis prevention and treatment, possess recently discovered 
anti-inflammatory properties, raising potential for improved sepsis prognosis.
METHOD: We conducted a retrospective analysis using the data from Medical 
Information Mart for Intensive Care-IV database. Patients were divided into an 
aspirin-alone group versus a combination group based on the use of a P2Y12 
inhibitor or not. Differences in 30-day mortality, length of stay (LOS) in 
intensive care unit (ICU), LOS in hospital, bleeding events and thrombotic 
events were compared between the two groups.
RESULT: A total of 1701 pairs of matched patients were obtained by propensity 
score matching. We found that no statistically significant difference in 30-day 
mortality in aspirin-alone group and combination group (15.3% vs. 13.7%, 
log-rank p = 0.154). In addition, patients received P2Y12 inhibitors had a 
higher incidence of gastrointestinal bleeding (0.5% vs. 1.6%, p = 0.004) and 
ischemic stroke (1.7% vs. 2.9%, p = 0.023), despite having a shorter LOS in 
hospital (11.1 vs. 10.3, days, p = 0.043). Cox regression showed that P2Y12 
inhibitor was not associated with 30-day mortality (HR = 1.14, 95% CI 0.95-1.36, 
p = 0.154).
CONCLUSION: P2Y12 inhibitors did not provide a survival benefit for patients 
with sepsis 3 and even led to additional adverse clinical outcomes.

OBJECTIVE: The relationship between the levels of the first 24-h PaCO2 and the 
prognosis of sepsis-associated encephalopathy (SAE) remains unclear, and the 
first 24-h optimal target for PaCO2 is currently inconclusive. This study was 
performed to investigate the correlation between PaCO2 and all-cause mortality 
for SAE patients, establish a reference range of the initial 24-hour PaCO2 for 
clinicians in critical care, and explain the possible pathophysiological 
mechanisms of abnormal PaCO2 levels as a higher mortality risk factor for SAE.
METHODS: The baseline information and clinical data of patients were extracted 
from the fourth edition Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care database 
(MIMIC-IV 2.0). Multivariate logistic regressions were performed to assess the 
relationship between PaCO2 and all-cause mortality of SAE. Additionally, 
restricted cubic splines, Kaplan-Meier Survival analyses, propensity score 
matching (PSM) analyses, and subgroup analyses were conducted.
RESULTS: A total of 5471 patients were included in our cohort. In the original 
and matched cohort, multivariate logistic regression analysis showed that 
normocapnia and mild hypercapnia may be associated with a more favorable 
prognosis of SAE patients, and survival analysis supported the findings. In 
addition, a U-shaped association emerged when examining the initial 24-hour 
PaCO2 levels in relation to 30-day, 60-day, and 90-day mortality using 
restricted cubic splines, with an average cut-off value of 36.3mmHg (P for 
nonlinearity<0.05). Below the cut-off value, higher PaCO2 was associated with 
lower all-cause mortality, while above the cut-off value, higher PaCO2 was 
associated with higher all-cause mortality. Subsequent subgroup analyses 
revealed similar results for the subcohort of GCS≤8 compared to the original 
cohort. Additionally, when examining the subcohort of GCS>8, a L-shaped 
relationship between PaCO2 and the three clinical endpoints emerged, in contrast 
to the previously observed U-shaped pattern. The findings from the subcohort of 
GCS>8 suggested that patients experiencing hypocapnia had a more unfavorable 
prognosis, which aligns with the results obtained from corresponding 
multivariate logistic regression analyses.
CONCLUSION: The retrospective study revealed the association between the first 
24-h PaCO2 and all-cause mortality risk (30-day, 60-day, and 90-day) for 
patients with SAE in ICU. The range (35mmHg-50mmHg) of PaCO2 may be the optimal 
target for patients with SAE in clinical practice.

BACKGROUND: Neonatal sepsis is associated with most cases of mortalities and 
morbidities in the neonatal intensive care unit (NICU). Many studies have 
developed prediction models for the early diagnosis of bloodstream infections in 
newborns, but there are limitations to data collection and management because 
these models are based on high-resolution waveform data.
OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to examine the feasibility of a prediction 
model by using noninvasive vital sign data and machine learning technology.
METHODS: We used electronic medical record data in intensive care units 
published in the Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care III clinical 
database. The late-onset neonatal sepsis (LONS) prediction algorithm using our 
proposed forward feature selection technique was based on NICU inpatient data 
and was designed to detect clinical sepsis 48 hours before occurrence. The 
performance of this prediction model was evaluated using various feature 
selection algorithms and machine learning models.
RESULTS: The performance of the LONS prediction model was found to be comparable 
to that of the prediction models that use invasive data such as high-resolution 
vital sign data, blood gas estimations, blood cell counts, and pH levels. The 
area under the receiver operating characteristic curve of the 48-hour prediction 
model was 0.861 and that of the onset detection model was 0.868. The main 
features that could be vital candidate markers for clinical neonatal sepsis were 
blood pressure, oxygen saturation, and body temperature. Feature generation 
using kurtosis and skewness of the features showed the highest performance.
CONCLUSIONS: The findings of our study confirmed that the LONS prediction model 
based on machine learning can be developed using vital sign data that are 
regularly measured in clinical settings. Future studies should conduct external 
validation by using different types of data sets and actual clinical 
verification of the developed model.

BACKGROUND: Enteral nutrition (EN) is recommended as the first choice by 
guidelines for critical ill patients. But the timing of safe and effective 
delivery of parenteral nutrition (PN) is unclear and the results of previous 
studies are controversial. There is insufficient evidence for the use of early 
PN, so we designed this cohort study to compared the clinical outcomes of 
critical ill patients who received early PN with those who did not.
METHODS: This retrospective study conducted using the Medical Information Mart 
for Intensive Care (MIMIC)-IV database. Patients who received nutrition therapy 
within 3 days of ICU admission were included and we categorized them as patients 
who received any kind of PN (PN group) or only enteral nutrition (EN group). 
Confounding factors were adjusted by propensity-score matching (PSM). The 
primary outcome was the 28-day mortality rate, and secondary outcomes included 
length of stay (LOS) in the hospital and ICU, hospital infection, and mechanical 
ventilation time.
RESULTS: A total of 5,019 patients (PN group, 357; EN group, 4,662) were 
included in the analyses. The 28-day mortality rates showed no significant 
intergroup difference (EN, 22.3% vs. PN, 20.2%; P=0.378). The PN group showed a 
shorter median ICU LOS (EN, 8.14 vs. PN, 6.89 days, P=0.00955), and a longer 
median hospital LOS (PN, 21.55 vs. EN, 15.1 days, P<0.001). After PSM, each 
group included 355 patients, with no significant intergroup difference in the 
28-day mortality rate (EN, 18.9% vs. PN, 20.3%; P=0.705). The PN group still 
showed a longer hospital LOS (median LOS: PN, 21.45 vs. EN, 14.81 days, 
P<0.001), but the other outcomes showed no differences.
CONCLUSIONS: PN within 3 days of ICU admission did not reduce the 28-day 
mortality rate and could extend hospital LOS. This study supports further 
fundamental and clinical research to ascertain the effect of PN for ICU 
patients.

BACKGROUND: Patients with sepsis have a high mortality rate. Rapid and effective 
risk stratification indicators for sepsis-related death are urgently needed to 
explored. Blood urea nitrogen (BUN) level can reflect the protein catabolism in 
the human body and the degree of renal impairment. So it has particular value 
for the management of septic patients. In this study, we explored the 
relationship between BUN level and 30-day mortality in patients with sepsis.
METHODS: In this retrospective cohort study, a total of 12,713 patients with 
sepsis from the Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care III (MIMIC-III) 
database were included. BUN level at admission was retrieved, and the outcome 
indicator was the 30-day mortality. Multivariate Cox regression analysis and 
smoothed curve fitting were used to assess the relationship between BUN and 
30-day mortality.
RESULTS: A total of 12,713 patients with sepsis were screened. The overall 
30-day mortality rate was 20.6%. The multivariate Cox regression model and 
smoothed curve fitting revealed a nonlinear association between BUN and 30-day 
mortality. The inflection point occurred at 41.1 mg/dL. The effect size was 
1.298 on the left side of the inflection point [hazard ratio (HR) =1.298; 95% 
confidence interval (CI): 1.224-1.376; P<0.001] and 1.045 on the right side of 
the inflection point (HR =1.045; 95% CI: 1.016-1.075; P=0.002).
CONCLUSIONS: There is a nonlinear correlation between BUN and 30-day mortality 
in patients with sepsis. With 41.1 mg/dL as a cutoff level for BUN, patients 
have a remarkably different risk of death and should be managed differently.

OBJECTIVE: To investigate the potential correlation between body mass index 
(BMI) and the 28-day mortality rate among sepsis patients and the gender 
difference in this association.
DESIGN: The current research was a retrospective cohort study.
PARTICIPANTS: A total of 14,883 male and female cohorts of sepsis patients were 
included in the Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care IV (MIMIC-IV V2.2) 
database. Patients in each gender cohort were further classified as underweight, 
normal weight, overweight, or obese according to BMI and the World Health 
Organization (WHO) BMI categories.
OUTCOMES: The 28-day mortality from the date of ICU hospitalization was the 
primary outcome measure.
RESULTS: The BMI and 28-day mortality exhibited an L-shaped relationship (p for 
nonlinearity <0.001) with significant gender-specific differences. Subgroup 
analysis revealed different association patterns between the male and female 
cohorts. Specifically, BMI and mortality exhibited a U-shaped curve relationship 
among the males (p for nonlinearity <0.001) and an L-shaped relationship among 
the females (p for nonlinearity = 0.045).
CONCLUSION: This study proposes a link between extreme BMI and 28-day mortality 
in patients with sepsis. Underweight patients have an increased risk of 
mortality; however, this risk decreases in overweight and obese patients. Upon 
stratifying by sex, a U-shaped pattern was observed, indicating an association 
between BMI and 28-day mortality in males, while an L-shaped pattern emerged in 
females.

BACKGROUND: The Surviving Sepsis Campaign Guidelines recommend stress ulcer 
prophylaxis (SUP) for patients with sepsis who have gastrointestinal (GI) 
bleeding risks; however, the effect of SUP has not been specially studied in 
these patients.
AIMS: To determine the effects of SUP versus no prophylaxis on patient-important 
outcomes in critically ill adult patients with sepsis who have risk factors for 
GI bleeding.
METHODS: This retrospective cohort study utilised data from the Medical 
Information Mart for Intensive Care III database. We compared those who received 
SUP with proton-pump inhibitors or histamine-2 receptor antagonists for ≥3 days 
with those who received no prophylaxis. Propensity score matching (PSM) was 
conducted to make comparisons between groups with similar distributions of study 
variables. The primary outcome was inhospital mortality.
RESULTS: A total of 7744 patients were included in the analysis, with 1088 
(14.0%) in the non-SUP group and 6656 (86.0%) in the SUP group. A 1:1 PSM 
created 866 patients in each cohort. No significant differences were noted 
between the two groups with regard to inhospital mortality (22.3% vs 20.4%; P 
= 0.379), GI bleeding (4.7% vs 6.4%; P = 0.172), pneumonia (38.9% vs 36.6%; P 
= 0.346), Clostridium difficile infection (CDI) (6.4% vs 8.9%; P = 0.0.057) or 
intensive care unit (ICU) length of stay (LOS) (4.2 days vs 4.6 days; P 
= 0.394).
CONCLUSIONS: Among critically ill, septic, adult patients at risk for GI 
bleeding, SUP showed no effect on hospital mortality, the rate of GI bleeding, 
pneumonia, CDI and ICU LOS.

OBJECTIVES: Establishing confidence in the safety of Artificial Intelligence 
(AI)-based clinical decision support systems is important prior to clinical 
deployment and regulatory approval for systems with increasing autonomy. Here, 
we undertook safety assurance of the AI Clinician, a previously published 
reinforcement learning-based treatment recommendation system for sepsis.
METHODS: As part of the safety assurance, we defined four clinical hazards in 
sepsis resuscitation based on clinical expert opinion and the existing 
literature. We then identified a set of unsafe scenarios, intended to limit the 
action space of the AI agent with the goal of reducing the likelihood of 
hazardous decisions.
RESULTS: Using a subset of the Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care 
(MIMIC-III) database, we demonstrated that our previously published 'AI 
clinician' recommended fewer hazardous decisions than human clinicians in three 
out of our four predefined clinical scenarios, while the difference was not 
statistically significant in the fourth scenario. Then, we modified the reward 
function to satisfy our safety constraints and trained a new AI Clinician agent. 
The retrained model shows enhanced safety, without negatively impacting model 
performance.
DISCUSSION: While some contextual patient information absent from the data may 
have pushed human clinicians to take hazardous actions, the data were curated to 
limit the impact of this confounder.
CONCLUSION: These advances provide a use case for the systematic safety 
assurance of AI-based clinical systems towards the generation of explicit safety 
evidence, which could be replicated for other AI applications or other clinical 
contexts, and inform medical device regulatory bodies.

PURPOSE: Sepsis involves a dysregulated inflammatory response to infection that 
leads to organ dysfunction. Early fluid resuscitation has been advocated by the 
Surviving Sepsis Campaign guidelines. However, recent studies have shown that a 
positive fluid balance is associated with increased mortality in septic 
patients. We investigated if haemoglobin levels on admission to the intensive 
care unit (ICU) could modify the association of fluid balance with mortality in 
patients with sepsis. We hypothesized that with increasing fluid balance, 
patients with moderate anemia (hemoglobin 7-10g/dL) would have poorer outcomes 
compared to those without moderate anemia (hemoglobin >10g/dL).
MATERIALS AND METHODS: This retrospective study utilized the Medical Information 
Mart for Intensive Care-III (MIMIC-III) database. Patients with sepsis, as 
identified by the International Classification of Diseases, 9th, Clinical 
Modification codes, were studied. Patients were stratified into those with and 
without moderate anemia at ICU admission. We investigated the influence of fluid 
balance measured within 24 hours of ICU admission on 28-day mortality for both 
patient groups using multivariable logistic regression models. Subgroup and 
sensitivity analyses were conducted.
RESULTS: 8,132 patients (median age 68.6 years, interquartile range 55.1-79.8 
years; 52.8% female) were included. Increasing fluid balance (in L) was 
associated with a significantly decreased risk of 28-day mortality in patients 
without moderate anemia (OR 0.91, 95%CI 0.84-0.97, p = 0.005, at 6-hour). 
Conversely, increasing fluid balance was associated with a significantly 
increased risk of 28-day mortality in patients with moderate anemia (OR 1.05, 
95% CI 1.01-1.1, p = 0.022, at 24-hour). Interaction analyses showed that 
mortality was highest when haemoglobin decreased in patients with moderate 
anemia who had the most positive fluid balance. Multiple subgroups and 
sensitivity analyses yielded consistent results.
CONCLUSIONS: In septic patients admitted to ICU, admission hemoglobin levels 
modified the association between fluid balance and mortality and are an 
important consideration for future fluid therapy trials.

Background: Atrial fibrillation (AF) and coagulation disorder, two common 
complications of sepsis, are associated with the mortality. However, the 
relationship between early coagulation disorder and AF in sepsis remains 
elusive. This study aimed to evaluate the interaction between AF and early 
coagulation disorder on mortality. Methods: In this retrospective study, all 
data were extracted from the Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care III 
(MIMIC-III) database. Septic patients with coagulation tests during the first 24 
h after admission to intensive care units (ICUs) meeting study criteria were 
included in the analysis. Early coagulation disorder is defined by abnormalities 
in platelet count (PLT), international normalized ratio (INR) and activated 
partial thromboplastin time (APTT) within the first 24 h after admission, whose 
score was defined with reference to sepsis-induced coagulopathy (SIC) and 
coagulopathy. Patients meeting study criteria were divided into AF and non-AF 
groups. Results: In total, 7,528 septic patients were enrolled, including 1,243 
(16.51%) with AF and 5,112 (67.91%) with early coagulation disorder. Compared 
with patients in the non-AF group, patients in the AF group had higher levels of 
INR and APTT (P < 0.001). Multivariable logistic regression analyses showed that 
stroke, early coagulation disorder, age, gender, congestive heart failure (CHF), 
chronic pulmonary disease, renal failure, and chronic liver disease were 
independent risk factors for AF. In addition, AF was related to in-hospital 
mortality and 90-day mortality. In the subgroup analysis stratified by the 
scores of early coagulation disorder, AF was associated with an increased risk 
of 90-day mortality when the scores of early coagulation disorder were 1 or 2 
and 3 or 4. Conclusion: In sepsis, coagulation disorder within the first 24 h 
after admission to the ICUs is an independent risk factor for AF. The effect of 
AF on 90-day mortality varies with the severity of early coagulation disorder.

Elevated serum chloride levels (hyperchloremia) and the administration of 
intravenous (IV) fluids with high chloride content have both been associated 
with increased morbidity and mortality in certain subgroups of critically ill 
patients, such as those with sepsis. Here, we demonstrate this association in a 
general intensive care unit (ICU) population using data from the Medical 
Information Mart for Intensive Care III (MIMIC-III) database and propose the use 
of supervised learning to predict hyperchloremia in critically ill patients. 
Clinical variables from records of the first 24h of adult ICU stays were 
represented as features for four predictive supervised learning classifiers. The 
best performing model was able to predict second-day hyperchloremia with an AUC 
of 0.80 and a ratio of 5 false alerts for every true alert, which is a 
clinically-actionable rate. Our results suggest that clinicians can be 
effectively alerted to patients at risk of developing hyperchloremia, providing 
an opportunity to mitigate this risk and potentially improve outcomes.

BACKGROUND: Sepsis-associated thrombocytopenia (SAT) is common in critical 
patients and results in the elevation of mortality. Red cell distribution width 
(RDW) can reflect body response to inflammation and oxidative stress. We try to 
investigate the relationship between the RDW and the prognosis of patients with 
SAT through machine learning.
METHODS: 809 patients were retrospectively analyzed from the Medical Information 
Mart for Intensive Care III (MIMIC-III) database. The eXtreme Gradient Boosting 
(XGBoost) and SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) were used to analyze the 
impact of each feature. Logistic regression analysis, propensity score matching 
(PSM), receiver-operating characteristics (ROC) curve analysis, and the 
Kaplan-Meier method were used for data processing.
RESULTS: The patients with thrombocytopenia had higher 28-day mortality (48.2%). 
Machine learning indicated that RDW was the second most important in predicting 
28-day mortality. The RDW was significantly increased in non-survivors by 
logistic regression and PSM. ROC curve shows that RDW has moderate predictive 
power for 28-day mortality. The patients with RDW>16.05 exhibited higher 
mortality through Kaplan-Meier analysis.
CONCLUSIONS: Interpretable machine learning can be applied in clinical research. 
Elevated RDW is not only common in patients with SAT but is also associated with 
a poor prognosis.

BACKGROUND: Several clinical trials of corticosteroids have been carried out in 
the treatment of septic shock, however, the therapeutic effect of the most 
widely used hydrocortisone is still controversial, and no studies have directly 
compared hydrocortisone versus hydrocortisone plus fludrocortisone for patients 
with septic shock.
METHODS: Baseline characteristics and treatment regimens of patients with septic 
shock treated with hydrocortisone from the Medical Information Mart for 
Intensive Care-IV database were collected. Patients were divided into 
hydrocortisone treatment groups and hydrocortisone plus fludrocortisone 
treatment groups. The primary outcome was 90-day mortality, and secondary 
outcomes included 28-day mortality, in-hospital mortality, length of hospital 
stay, and length of intensive care unit (ICU) stay. Binomial Logistic regression 
analysis was performed to identify independent risk factors for mortality. 
Survival analysis was performed and Kaplan-Meier curves were drawn for patients 
in different treatment groups. Propensity score matching (PSM) analysis was 
performed to reduce bias.
RESULTS: Six hundred and fifty three patients were enrolled, of which 583 were 
treated with hydrocortisone alone, and 70 with hydrocortisone plus 
fludrocortisone. After PSM, 70 patients were included in each group. The 
proportion of patients with acute kidney injury (AKI) and the proportion of 
renal replacement therapy (RRT) treatment in the hydrocortisone plus 
fludrocortisone group were higher than those in the hydrocortisone alone group, 
and there was no significant difference in other baseline characteristics. 
Compared with hydrocortisone alone, hydrocortisone plus fludrocortisone did not 
reduce the 90-day mortality (after PSM, relative risk/RR = 1.07, 95%CI 
0.75-1.51), 28-day mortality (after PSM, RR = 0.82, 95%CI 0.59-1.14) and 
in-hospital mortality (after PSM, RR = 0.79, 95%CI 0.57-1.11) of the enrolled 
patients, nor did it affect the length of hospital stay (after PSM, 13.9 days 
vs. 10.9 days, p = 0.34) and ICU stay (after PSM, 6.0 days vs. 3.7 days, p 
= 0.14), and the survival analysis showed no statistically significant 
difference in the corresponding survival time. After PSM, binomial Logistic 
regression analysis showed that SAPS II score was an independent risk factor for 
28-day morality (OR = 1.04, 95%CI 1.02-1.06, p < 0.01) and in-hospital morality 
(OR = 1.04, 95%CI 1.01-1.06, p < 0.01), while hydrocortisone plus 
fludrocortisone was not an independent risk factor for 90-day mortality 
(OR = 0.88, 95%CI 0.43-1.79, p = 0.72), 28-day morality (OR = 1.50, 95%CI 
0.77-2.91, p = 0.24), or in-hospital morality (OR = 1.58, 95%CI 0.81-3.09, p 
= 0.18).
CONCLUSION: In the treatment of patients with septic shock, hydrocortisone plus 
fludrocortisone did not reduce 90-day mortality, 28-day mortality, and 
in-hospital mortality compared with hydrocortisone alone, and had no effect on 
the length of hospital stay and ICU stay.

Iron is an essential nutrient for bacterial survival and thus higher iron levels 
may precipitate bacterial infections. We investigated the association between 
the serum iron level and prognosis in patients with sepsis by using the 
single-centre Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care III (MIMIC-III) 
database. Sepsis patients with iron parameters measured on ICU admission were 
included and stratified according to quartiles of serum iron levels. A total of 
1,891 patients diagnosed with sepsis according to the Sepsis-3 criteria were 
included in this study, 324 of whom were septic shock. After adjusting for 
confounding variables, higher iron quartile was associated with an increase in 
90-day mortality in the Cox regression analysis. Moreover, a stepwise increase 
in the risk of 90-day mortality was observed as the quartiles of serum iron 
levels increased in the patients with sepsis. In conclusion, higher serum iron 
levels were independently associated with increased 90-day mortality in this 
large cohort of patients with sepsis.

(1) Background: Urinary tract infection (UTI) is a leading cause of emergency 
department visits and hospital admissions. Despite many studies identifying 
UTI-related risk factors for bacteremia or sepsis, a significant gap remains in 
developing predictive models for in-hospital mortality or the necessity for 
emergent intensive care unit admission in the emergency department. This study 
aimed to construct interpretable machine learning models capable of identifying 
patients at high risk for critical outcomes. (2) Methods: This was a 
retrospective study of adult patients with urinary tract infection (UTI), 
extracted from the Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care IV Emergency 
Department (MIMIC-IV-ED) database. The critical outcome is defined as either 
in-hospital mortality or transfer to an intensive care unit within 12 h. ED 
visits were randomly partitioned into a 70%/30% split for training and 
validation. The extreme gradient boosting (XGBoost), random forest (RF), and 
support vector machine (SVM) algorithms were constructed using variables 
selected from the stepwise logistic regression model. The XGBoost model was then 
compared to the traditional model and clinical decision rules (CDRs) on the 
validation data using the area under the curve (AUC). (3) Results: There were 
3622 visits among 3235 unique patients diagnosed with UTI. Of the 2535 patients 
in the training group, 836 (33%) experienced critical outcomes, and of the 1087 
patients in the validation group, 358 (32.9%) did. The AUCs for different 
machine learning models were as follows: XGBoost, 0.833; RF, 0.814; and SVM, 
0.799. The XGBoost model performed better than others. (4) Conclusions: Machine 
learning models outperformed existing traditional CDRs for predicting critical 
outcomes of ED patients with UTI. Future research should prospectively evaluate 
the effectiveness of this approach and integrate it into clinical practice.

This study aimed to develop models for predicting the 30-day mortality of 
sepsis-associated delirium (SAD) by multiple machine learning (ML) algorithms. 
On the whole, a cohort of 3,197 SAD patients were collected from the Medical 
Information Mart for Intensive Care (MIMIC)-IV database. Among them, a total of 
659 (20.61%) patients died following SAD. The patients who died were about 73.00 
(62.00, 82.00) years old and mostly male (56.75%). Recursive feature elimination 
(RFE) was used to distinguish risk factors. Subsequently, six ML algorithms 
including artificial neural network (NNET), gradient boosting machine (GBM), 
adaptive boosting (Ada), random forest (RF), eXtreme Gradient Boosting (XGB) and 
logistic regression (LR) were employed to establish models to predict the 30-day 
mortality of SAD. The performance of models was assessed via both discrimination 
and calibration by cross-validation with 100 resamples. Overall, 10 independent 
predictors, including Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS), Sequential Organ Failure 
Assessment (SOFA), anion gap (AG), continuous renal replacement therapy (CRRT), 
temperature, mean corpuscular hemoglobin concentration (MCHC), vasopressor, 
blood urea nitrogen (BUN), base excess (BE), and bicarbonate were identified as 
independent predictors for the 30-day mortality of SAD. The validation cohort 
demonstrated that all these six models had relatively favorable differentiation, 
while among them, the GBM model had the highest area under the curve (AUC) of 
0.845 (95% Confidence Interval (CI): 0.816, 0.874). Furthermore, the calibration 
curve of these six models was close to the diagonal line in the validation sets. 
As for decision curve analysis, the predictive models were clinically useful as 
well. Based on real-world research, we developed ML models to provide 
personalized predictions of delirium-related mortality in sepsis patients, 
potentially enabling clinicians to identify high-risk SAD patients more 
promptly.

Metabolic acidosis is usually associated with the severity of the condition of 
patients with sepsis or septic shock. Serum anion gap (AG) is one of the 
indicators of response metabolism. This study was performed to investigate 
whether the initial serum AG is associated with the 28-day mortality in 
critically ill adult patients with sepsis. This retrospective cohort study, a 
total of 15,047 patients with confirmed Sepsis disease from 2008 to 2019 from 
the Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care IV (MIMIC-IV) v1.0 database. The 
MIMIC-IV database is a comprehensive, de-identified clinical dataset originating 
from the Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center in Boston, it includes extensive 
data on intensive care unit (ICU) patients, such as vital signs, lab results, 
and medication orders, spanning multiple years, accessible to researchers 
through an application process. AG can be obtained by direct extraction in the 
MIMIC-IV database (itemid = 50,868 from the laboratory events table of 
mimic_hosp), inclusion of AG values for the first test on first day of ICU 
admission. The patients were grouped into quartiles according to the AG 
interquartile range. The primary outcome was the 28-day mortality. Multiple 
logistic regression analysis was used to calculate the odds ratio (OR), while 
accounting for potential confounders, and the robustness of the results were 
evaluated in subgroup analyses. Among the 15,047 patients included in this 
study, the average age was 65.9 ± 16.0 years, 42.5% were female, 66.1% were 
Caucasian, and the 28-day mortality rate was 17.9% (2686/15,047). Multiple 
logistic regression analysis revealed the 28-day mortality in every increase of 
AG (per SD mEq/L), there is an associated 1.2 times (OR 1.2, 95% CI 1.12-1.29, 
P < .001) increase. Increased 28-day mortality (OR 1.53, 95% confidence interval 
1.29-1.81, P < .001) in the group with the AG (15-18 mEq/L), and (OR 1.69, 95% 
confidence interval 1.4-2.04, P < .001) in the group with the highest AG (≥18 
mEq/L), AG (<12 mEq/L) as a reference group, in the fully adjusted model. In 
adult patients with sepsis, the early AG at the time of ICU admission is an 
independent risk factor for prognosis.

Elevated lactate levels are common in sepsis patients. This study aimed to 
assess the effect of dynamic changes in lactate levels within the first 24 hours 
following admission on patient prognosis. We extracted data from the Medical 
Information Mart for Intensive Care (MIMIC)-IV database and classified patients 
using latent class growth analysis (LCGA). This analysis classified sepsis 
patients into different groups based on dynamic changes in lactate levels during 
the initial 24 hours post-admission, dividing this time frame into four periods 
(0-3 h, 3-6 h, 6-12 h, and 12-24 h). The highest lactate level recorded in each 
period was then used for patient classification. We subsequently compared the 
baseline characteristics and outcomes between these different groups. Our study 
encompassed 7,830 patients, whom LCGA successfully divided into two classes: 
class 1 (steady lactate class) and class 2 (increasing lactate class). Class 2 
demonstrated a worse clinical status at baseline, as indicated by vital signs, 
disease severity scores, and laboratory results. Importantly, class 2 also had a 
significantly higher 28-day mortality rate than class 1 (55.6% vs 13.5%, P < 
0.001). In conclusion, LCGA effectively categorized sepsis patients into two 
distinct groups based on their dynamic changes in lactate levels during the 
first 24 hours post-admission. This methodology has potential utility in 
clinical practice for managing sepsis patients.

OBJECTIVES: The objective of the study was to assess the clinical predictive 
value of the dynamics of absolute lymphocyte count (ALC) for 90-day all-cause 
mortality in sepsis patients in intensive care unit (ICU).
DESIGN: Retrospective cohort study using big data.
SETTING: This study was conducted using the Medical Information Mart for 
Intensive Care IV database V.2.0 database.
PRIMARY AND SECONDARY OUTCOME MEASURES: The primary outcome was 90-day all-cause 
mortality.
PARTICIPANTS: Patients were included if they were diagnosed with sepsis on the 
first day of ICU admission. Exclusion criteria were ICU stay under 24 hours; the 
absence of lymphocyte count on the first day; extremely high lymphocyte count 
(>10×109/L); history of haematolymphatic tumours, bone marrow or solid organ 
transplants; survival time under 72 hours and previous ICU admissions. The 
analysis ultimately included 17 329 sepsis patients.
RESULTS: The ALC in the non-survivors group was lower on days 1, 3, 5 and 7 
after admission (p<0.001). The ALC on day 7 had the highest area under the curve 
(AUC) value for predicting 90-day mortality. The cut-off value of ALC on day 7 
was 1.0×109/L. In the restricted cubic spline plot, after multivariate 
adjustments, patients with higher lymphocyte counts had a better prognosis. 
After correction, in the subgroups with Sequential Organ Failure Assessment 
score ≥6 or age ≥60 years, ALC on day 7 had the lowest HR value (0.79 and 0.81, 
respectively). On the training and testing set, adding the ALC on day 7 improved 
all prediction models' AUC and average precision values.
CONCLUSIONS: Dynamic changes of ALC are closely associated with 90-day all-cause 
mortality in sepsis patients. Furthermore, the ALC on day 7 after admission is a 
better independent predictor of 90-day mortality in sepsis patients, especially 
in severely ill or young sepsis patients.

Red cell distribution width (RDW) and glycated hemoglobin index (HGI) is 
considered an important tool for assessing the prognosis of sepsis patients, 
closely related to the risk of mortality associated with sepsis. This study 
investigates the association between the HGI combined with RDW and the risk of 
in-hospital mortality in patients with sepsis. We analyzed data from 13,726 
sepsis patients who were admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) for more than 
24 h, sourced from the American Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care 
(MIMIC-IV) database. Kaplan-Meier survival curves and multivariable Cox 
regression analyses were employed to assess the impact of various variables on 
patient outcomes, stratified by quartiles of HGI and RDW. Additionally, 
restricted cubic spline (RCS) analysis was utilized to explore how changes in 
HGI and RDW might influence the studied outcomes. The results indicated that the 
highest quartile (Q4) of the combined metrics significantly increased 
in-hospital mortality compared to the lowest quartile (Q1) (p < 0.0001). 
Multivariable Cox regression analysis revealed that patients in Q4 faced the 
highest risk of in-hospital mortality (hazard ratio: 1.22, 95% confidence 
interval: [1.10-1.36], p < 0.001). RCS analysis demonstrated a nonlinear 
relationship between HGI-RDW and the risk of adverse outcomes. Further analysis 
identified significantly elevated risks in patients over 65 years old, those who 
were widowed, those receiving macrolide antibiotics, and those with congestive 
heart failure or severe liver disease. In conclusion, elevated levels of the 
combined HGI and RDW metrics are independent risk factors for adverse outcomes 
in critically ill patients with sepsis, associated with increased mortality.

OBJECTIVES: The ratio of ferritin to albumin (FAR) has been proposed as a novel 
prognostic indicator for COVID-19. However, the role of FAR in predicting the 
all-cause mortality rate in patients with sepsis has not been evaluated. 
Therefore, the aim of this study is to elucidate the correlation between FAR and 
the 28-day all-cause mortality rate in patients with sepsis.
METHODS: This study used data from the Medical Information Mart for Intensive 
Care IV database (v2.0) for a retrospective cohort analysis. The study focused 
on adult patients with sepsis who were admitted to the intensive care unit. The 
primary objective was to assess the predictive capability of FAR in determining 
the 28-day all-cause mortality rate among patients with sepsis.
RESULTS: The study involved 1553 sepsis patients in total. Based on the survival 
status of sepsis patients within 28 days, they were divided into two groups: a 
survival group consisting of 973 patients, and a death group consisting of 580 
patients. The results revealed a 28-day mortality rate of 37.35% among sepsis 
patients. The multivariable Cox regression analysis revealed that FAR was an 
independent predictor of the 28-day all-cause mortality rate in patients with 
sepsis (hazard ratio [HR]: 1.17-1.19; 95% confidence interval 1.11-1.26; 
P < 0.001). The FAR demonstrated a higher area under the curve (AUC) of 61.01% 
(95% confidence interval 58.07-63.96%), compared to serum ferritin (60.48%), 
serum albumin (55.56%), and SOFA score (56.97%). Receiver operating 
characteristic curve (ROC) analysis determined the optimal cutoff value for FAR 
as 364.2215. Kaplan-Meier analysis revealed a significant difference in the 
28-day all-cause mortality rate between patients with FAR ≥ 364.2215 and those 
with FAR < 364.2215 (P < 0.001). Furthermore, subgroup analysis showed no 
significant interaction between FAR and each subgroup.
CONCLUSIONS: This study revealed a significant correlation between FAR and the 
28-day mortality rate in patients with sepsis. Higher FAR values were strongly 
associated with increased mortality rates within 28 days.

We previously reported the added value of 24-hour lactate concentration alone 
and in combination with 24-hour lactate clearance and lactate concentration at 
admission for the prediction of inhospital mortality in critically ill patients 
with sepsis. We aimed to validate this finding.
DERIVATION COHORT: The derivation cohort from Leiden, The Netherlands, consisted 
of 451 critically ill patients with sepsis.
VALIDATION COHORT: The validation cohort consisted of 4,440 critically ill adult 
patients with sepsis from the Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care cohort 
admitted to the ICU of Beth Israel Deaconness Medical Center, Boston, MA, 
between January 2006 and 2018.
PREDICTION MODEL: Predictors of mortality were: age, chronic comorbidities, 
length of stay pre-ICU, Glasgow Coma Scale, and Acute Physiology Score. Lactate 
concentration at 24-hour alone, in combination with 24-hour lactate clearance 
and in combination with lactate concentration at admission, was added to assess 
improvement of the prediction model. The outcome was inhospital mortality.
RESULTS: Inhospital mortality occurred in 160 patients (36%) in the derivation 
cohort and in 2,347 patients (53%) in the validation cohort. The Acute 
Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation (APACHE) IV model had a moderate 
discriminative performance (recalibrated C-statistic, 0.62; 95% CI, 0.60-0.63). 
Addition of 24-hour lactate concentration increased the recalibrated C-statistic 
to 0.64 (95% CI, 0.62-0.66). The model with 24-hour lactate concentration and 
lactate concentration at admission showed the best fit as depicted by the 
smallest Akaike Information Criterion in both the derivation and validation 
data.
CONCLUSION: The 24-hour lactate concentration and lactate concentration at 
admission contribute modestly to prediction of inhospital mortality in 
critically ill patients with sepsis. Future updates and possible modification of 
APACHE IV should consider the incorporation of lactate concentration at baseline 
and at 24 hours.

OBJECTIVE: We aimed to compare the efficacy and risks of proton pump inhibitor 
(PPI) versus histamine-2 receptor blocker (H2B) use for stress ulcer prophylaxis 
(SUP) in critically ill patients with sepsis and risk factors for 
gastrointestinal bleeding (GIB).
METHODS: In this retrospective cohort study, we used the Medical Information 
Mart for Intensive Care III Clinical Database to identify critically ill adult 
patients with sepsis who had at least one risk factor for GIB and received 
either an H2B or PPI for ≥48 hours. Propensity score matching (PSM) was 
conducted to balance baseline characteristics. The primary outcome was 
in-hospital mortality.
RESULTS: After 1:1 PSM, 1056 patients were included in the H2B and PPI groups. 
The PPI group had higher in-hospital mortality (23.8% vs. 17.5%), GIB (8.9% vs. 
1.6%), and pneumonia (49.6% vs. 41.6%) rates than the H2B group. After adjusting 
for risk factors of GIB and pneumonia, PPI use was associated with a 1.28-times 
increased risk of in-hospital mortality, 5.89-times increased risk of GIB, and 
1.32-times increased risk of pneumonia.
CONCLUSIONS: Among critically ill adult patients with sepsis at risk for GIB, 
SUP with PPIs was associated with higher in-hospital mortality and higher risk 
of GIB and pneumonia than H2Bs.

BACKGROUND: This study aimed to assess the prognostic significance of serum 
ferritin levels in sepsis-associated acute kidney injury (SA-AKI) and their 
correlation with short-term mortality. Despite the established predictive value 
of serum ferritin in various serious diseases, its specific prognostic relevance 
in SA-AKI remains unexplored. Therefore, this study seeks to fill this research 
gap by investigating the association between serum ferritin levels and 
short-term mortality in patients with SA-AKI.
METHODS: This retrospective cohort study utilized clinical data from the Medical 
Information Mart for Intensive Care-IV (MIMIC-IV) database, including all 
patients with SA-AKI admitted to the intensive care unit for the first time. The 
relationship between serum ferritin levels and 28-day mortality was explored 
using restricted cubic splines. Kaplan-Meier curves and Cox regression models 
were employed to evaluate the association between serum ferritin levels and 
mortality. Subgroup and sensitivity analyses were performed to verify the 
robustness of the results.
RESULTS: In this study, a total of 878 patients (486 males and 392 females) with 
a median age of 63.7 years were enrolled. The results indicated that increasing 
serum ferritin levels were linearly associated with a gradual increase in 28-day 
mortality rates. Specifically, patients in the highest quartile of serum 
ferritin had significantly higher 28-day mortality compared to those in the 
reference group (the first quartile of ferritin levels). After adjusting for 
various factors, the fully adjusted hazard ratio was 1.92 (95% CI: 1.24-2.96, p 
= 0.003).
CONCLUSION: In patients with SA-AKI, higher serum ferritin levels are associated 
with an increased 28-day mortality rate.

BACKGROUND: Sepsis is a prevalent and severe medical condition which is 
frequently observed in the intensive care unit (ICU). Although numerous 
biomarkers have been identified to predict the prognosis of sepsis, the lactate 
dehydrogenase to albumin ratio (LDH/ALB ratio) has not been extensively 
investigated. The principal objective of this study is to assess the 
relationship between LDH/ALB ratio and all-cause mortality in patients with 
sepsis.
METHODS: This study included all adult critically ill patients with sepsis from 
the Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care IV (MIMIC-IV, version 2.0) 
database. Propensity score matching (PSM) analysis was conducted to mitigate 
bias, and Kaplan-Meier curves were performed to evaluate the cumulative survival 
across different groups. The association between the LDH/ALB ratio and mortality 
was examined through restricted cubic spline (RCS) analysis and Cox regression 
analysis. The robustness of the findings was confirmed through subgroup 
analyses. Additionally, the prognostic capability of the LDH/ALB ratio was 
further evaluated using receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis.
RESULTS: There were 6059 adult patients with sepsis enrolled in the final 
analysis. RCS revealed a non-linear relationship between the LDH/ALB ratio and 
an increased risk of ICU all-cause mortality (χ2 = 46.900, P < 0.001). Following 
PSM analysis, 1553 matched pairs were obtained. As comparison to the low LDH/ALB 
ratio group, the mortality rate in the high LDH/ALB ratio group was 
significantly higher (P < 0.001). Kaplan-Meier curves, both before and after 
PSM, revealed that the ICU cumulative survival rate for patients with sepsis was 
significantly lower in the high LDH/ALB ratio group compared to the low LDH/ALB 
ratio group (χ2 = 93.360, P < 0.001; χ2 = 14.400, P < 0.001). Even after 
adjusting for a range of potential confounders, multivariate Cox regression 
analysis indicated that an elevated LDH/ALB ratio was a significant predictor of 
all-cause mortality in these patients. ROC curve analysis demonstrated that the 
LDH/ALB ratio had an area under the ROC curve (AUC) of 0.688 for predicting ICU 
mortality, with a sensitivity of 69.2% and a specificity of 58.6%.
CONCLUSIONS: An elevated LDH/ALB ratio (≥10.57) was associated with all-cause 
mortality in critically ill patients with sepsis, and it might serve as a 
prognostic marker. Clinicians should pay closer attention to sepsis patients 
presenting with an LDH/ALB ratio of 10.57 or higher.

BACKGROUND: In sepsis patients, kidney damage is among the most dangerous 
complications, with a high mortality rate. In addition, major adverse kidney 
events within 30 days (MAKE30) served as a comprehensive and unbiased clinical 
outcome measure for sepsis patients due to the recent shift toward targeting 
patient-centered renal outcomes in clinical research. However, the underlying 
predictive model for the prediction of MAKE30 in sepsis patients has not been 
reported in any study.
METHODS: A cohort of 2,849 sepsis patients from the Medical Information Mart for 
Intensive Care (MIMIC)-IV database was selected and subsequently allocated into 
a training set (n = 2,137, 75%) and a validation set (n = 712, 25%) through 
randomization. In addition, 142 sepsis patients from the Xi'An No. 3 Hospital as 
an external validation group. Univariate and multivariate logistic regression 
analyses were conducted to ascertain the independent predictors of MAKE30. 
Subsequently, a nomogram was developed utilizing these predictors, with an area 
under curve (AUC) above 0.6. The performance of nomogram was assessed through 
calibration curve, receiver operating characteristics (ROC) curve, and decision 
curve analysis (DCA). The secondary outcome was 30-day mortality, persistent 
renal dysfunction (PRD), and new renal replacement therapy (RRT). MAKE30 were a 
composite of death, PRD, new RRT.
RESULTS: The construction of the nomogram was based on several independent 
predictors (AUC above 0.6), including age, respiratory rate (RR), PaO2, lactate, 
and blood urea nitrogen (BUN). The predictive model demonstrated satisfactory 
discrimination for MAKE30, with an AUC of 0.740, 0.753, and 0.821 in the 
training, internal validation, and external validation cohorts, respectively. 
Furthermore, the simple prediction model exhibited superior predictive value 
compared to the SOFA model in both the training (AUC = 0.710) and validation 
(AUC = 0.692) cohorts. The nomogram demonstrated satisfactory calibration and 
clinical utility as evidenced by the calibration curve and DCA. Additionally, 
the predictive model exhibited excellent accuracy in forecasting 30-day 
mortality (AUC = 0.737), PRD (AUC = 0.639), and new RRT (AUC = 0.846) within the 
training dataset. Additionally, the model displayed predictive power for 30-day 
mortality (AUC = 0.765), PRD (AUC = 0.667), and new RRT (AUC = 0.783) in the 
validation set.
CONCLUSION: The proposed nomogram holds the potential to estimate the risk of 
MAKE30 promptly and efficiently in sepsis patients within the initial 24 h of 
admission, thereby equipping healthcare professionals with valuable insights to 
facilitate personalized interventions.

BACKGROUND: Sepsis-associated encephalopathy (SAE) is a complex condition with 
variable outcomes. This study investigates the potential of the 
Triglyceride-glucose (TyG) index as a marker for disease severity and prognosis 
in SAE patients.
METHODS: We conducted a retrospective cohort study using data from the Medical 
Information Mart for Intensive Care (MIMIC-IV) database. Patients with sepsis 
who were admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) were categorized into two 
groups based on the occurrence of SAE. Key clinical outcomes were 90-day 
survival (primary outcome) and length of ICU and hospital stays, as well as the 
use of vasoactive medications (secondary outcomes). The TyG index was 
calculated, and its association with disease severity scores and patient 
outcomes was analyzed using statistical methods, including survival analysis, 
Cox regression, and correlation analyses.
RESULTS: The study population's median age was 65.96 years, predominantly male 
(60.1%). Higher TyG index scores correlated with elevated clinical severity 
scores (APSIII, LODS, OASIS, SAPSII, and CCI) and increased ICU and hospital 
stay durations. TyG index categorization revealed significant differences in 
90-day survival probabilities, with "high TyG" associated with a 25% increased 
mortality risk compared to "low TyG." Furthermore, TyG index showed a moderate 
positive correlation with ICU stay duration and use of norepinephrine and 
vasopressin, but not with dopamine and epinephrine use.
CONCLUSION: The TyG index is a significant independent predictor of disease 
severity and prognosis in SAE patients. High TyG levels correlate with worse 
clinical outcomes and increased mortality risk, suggesting its potential as a 
valuable tool in managing SAE.

Objective: To examine the clinical significance of the blood lactate (Lac)/serum 
albumin (Alb) ratio and the Lac/Alb × age score for assessing the severity and 
prognosis of patients with sepsis. Methods: A total of 8,029 patients with 
sepsis, aged >18 years were enrolled between June 2001 to October 2012 from the 
latest version of the Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care III (MIMIC-III 
v.1.4). The general data of the patients were obtained from hospital records and 
included gender, age, body mass index (BMI), laboratory indices, the sequential 
organ failure assessment (SOFA) score, and simplified acute physiology score II 
(SAPS II). The patients were graded and scored according to their age and then 
divided into a survival or death group based on their prognosis. The Lac/Alb 
ratio after ICU admission was calculated and compared between the two groups. 
The risk factors for death in patients with sepsis were determined using 
multivariate logistic regression analysis, while mortality was examined using 
receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve and survival curve plots. Finally, 
the values of the Lac/Alb ratio and Lac/Alb × age score for assessing prognosis 
of patients with sepsis were analyzed and compared. Results: After items with 
default values were excluded, a total of 4,555 patients with sepsis were 
enrolled (2,526 males and 2,029 females). 2,843 cases were classified as the 
death group and 1,712 cases in the survival group. (1) The mean age, BMI, SOFA 
and SAPS II scores were higher in the death group than those in the survival 
group. Significant differences in baseline data between the two groups were also 
observed. (2) The patients in the death group were divided further into four 
subgroups according to the quartile of the Lac/Alb ratio from low to high. 
Comparison of the four subgroups showed that the death rate rose with an 
increase in the Lac/Alb ratio, while analysis of the survival curve revealed 
that patients with a higher Lac/Alb ratio had a worse prognosis. (3) 
Multivariate logistic regression analysis showed that age ≥ 60 years, overweight 
(BMI ≥ 24 kg/m2), Lac/Alb ratio ≥ 0.16, SOFA score ≥ 2 points, and SAPS II ≥ 40 
points were independent risk factors for death in patients with septic. (4) ROC 
curve analysis indicated that the SAPS II, Lac/Alb x age score, SOFA, and 
Lac/Alb ratio were the best predictors of death in patients with sepsis. The 
Lac/Alb × age score was characterized by its simple acquisition and ability to 
quickly analyze the prognosis of patients. Conclusion: (1)A high Lac/Alb ratio 
is an independent risk factor for death in patients with sepsis. (2) Although 
the prognosis of sepsis can be accurately and comprehensively assessed by 
multi-dimensional analysis of multiple indices, the Lac/Alb × age score is more 
accurate and convenient for providing a general assessment of prognosis, so is 
worthy of further clinical recognition.

BACKGROUND: Increased chloride in the context of intravenous fluid chloride load 
and serum chloride levels (hyperchloremia) have previously been associated with 
increased morbidity and mortality in select subpopulations of intensive care 
unit (ICU) patients (e.g patients with sepsis). Here, we study the general ICU 
population of the Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care III (MIMIC-III) 
database to corroborate these associations, and propose a supervised learning 
model for the prediction of hyperchloremia in ICU patients.
METHODS: We assessed hyperchloremia and chloride load and their associations 
with several outcomes (ICU mortality, new acute kidney injury [AKI] by day 7, 
and multiple organ dysfunction syndrome [MODS] on day 7) using regression 
analysis. Four predictive supervised learning classifiers were trained to 
predict hyperchloremia using features representative of clinical records from 
the first 24h of adult ICU stays.
RESULTS: Hyperchloremia was shown to have an independent association with 
increased odds of ICU mortality, new AKI by day 7, and MODS on day 7. High 
chloride load was also associated with increased odds of ICU mortality. Our best 
performing supervised learning model predicted second-day hyperchloremia with an 
AUC of 0.76 and a number needed to alert (NNA) of 7-a clinically-actionable 
rate.
CONCLUSIONS: Our results support the use of predictive models to aid clinicians 
in monitoring for and preventing hyperchloremia in high-risk patients and offers 
an opportunity to improve patient outcomes.

OBJECTIVE: The prognostic value of the red cell distribution width (RDW) in 
patients with sepsis-induced acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) is still 
elusive. This study is aimed at determining whether RDW is a prognostic 
indicator of sepsis-induced ARDS.
METHODS: This retrospective cohort study included 1161 patients with 
sepsis-induced ARDS. The datasets were acquired from the Medical Information 
Mart for Intensive Care III database. The locally weighted scatter-plot 
smoothing technique, Cox regression, Kaplan-Meier estimator, and subgroup 
analysis were carried out to evaluate the association between RDW and 90-day 
mortality.
RESULTS: The RDW and mortality had a roughly linear increasing relationship. The 
Cox regression model results were as follows: for level 2 (14.5% < RDW < 16.2%), 
hazard ratio (HR) = 1.35, 95% confidence interval (CI) = 1.03-1.77, and for 
level 3 (RDW ≥ 16.2%), HR = 2.07, 95% CI = 1.59-2.69. The following results were 
obtained when RDW was treated as a continuous variable: HR = 1.11, 95%CI = 
1.06-1.15. The P values of the interaction between the RDW and covariates were 
greater than 0.05.
CONCLUSION: RDW is a new independent prognostic marker for patients with 
sepsis-induced ARDS.

BACKGROUND: Vasopressin is used in conjunction with norepinephrine during 
treatment of patients with septic shock. Serum lactate is often used in 
monitoring of patients with sepsis; however, its importance as a therapeutic 
target is unclear. The objective of this study is to examine the relationship of 
vasopressin use on serum lactate levels in patients with sepsis.
METHODS: This study uses electronic heath records available via the Medical 
Information Mart for Intensive Care III. Patients were required to have a serum 
lactate monitoring during the intensive care unit (ICU) stay. The treatment was 
the administration of vasopressin between hours 3 and 18 of the ICU stay. 
Analysis was performed using a matched design.
RESULTS: Patients receiving vasopressin were more likely to have their serum 
lactate levels rise when compared to matched patients who did not receive 
vasopressin (odds ratio: 6.6; 95% confidence interval: 3.0-14.6, P < .001). 
Patients who received vasopressin had a median increase in serum lactate of 0.3 
mmol/L, while patients who did not receive vasopressin had a median decrease in 
serum lactate of 0.7 mmol/L (P < .001). There was no statistically significant 
difference between the control and treated groups' lactate trajectories prior to 
possible administration of vasopressin (P = .15). The results did not change 
significantly when norepinephrine initiation was used as the index time.
CONCLUSIONS: In patients with sepsis, the administration of vasopressin was 
associated with a statistically significant difference in lactate change over 
the course of 24 hours when compared to matched patients who did not receive 
vasopressin.

OBJECTIVE: To explore the risk factors affecting the prognosis of patients with 
sepsis complicated with acute pulmonary embolism, and to construct and validate 
a nomogram predictive model for in-hospital mortality risk.
METHODS: Based on the American Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care 
(MIMIC-III, MIMIC-IV) databases, the data were collected on patients with sepsis 
complicated with acute pulmonary embolism from 2001 to 2019, including baseline 
characteristics, and vital signs, disease scores, laboratory tests within 24 
hours of admission to the intensive care unit (ICU), and interventions. 
In-hospital mortality was the outcome event. The total samples were divided into 
training and testing sets in a 7:3 ratio by random sampling. Univariate Cox 
regression analysis was used to verify the impact of all variables on the risk 
of in-hospital mortality, thereby screen potential influencing factors. 
Subsequently, a stepwise bi-directional regression method was applied to select 
factors one by one, leading to the construction of a nomogram prediction model. 
Collinearity testing was used to demonstrate the absence of strong 
multicollinearity among the influencing factors in the nomogram prediction 
model. The discrimination of the nomogram model, sequential organ failure 
assessment (SOFA), and simplified pulmonary embolism severity index (sPESI) was 
evaluated using C-index in the test set. Receiver operator characteristic curve 
(ROC curve) was drawn to evaluate the predictive value of various models for 
in-hospital mortality in patients with sepsis complicated with acute pulmonary 
embolism.
RESULTS: A total of 562 patients with sepsis complicated with acute pulmonary 
embolism were included, including 393 in the training set and 169 in the testing 
set. Univariate Cox regression analysis showed that 30 factors associated with 
in-hospital mortality in patients with sepsis complicated with acute pulmonary 
embolism. Through stepwise bi-directional regression, 12 variables were 
ultimately selected, including gender, presence of malignant tumors, body 
temperature, red cell distribution width (RDW), blood urea nitrogen (BUN), serum 
potassium, prothrombin time (PT), 24-hour urine output, mechanical ventilation, 
vasoactive drugs, warfarin use, and sepsis-induced coagulopathy (SIC). 
Collinearity testing indicated no strong multicollinearity among the influencing 
factors [all variance inflation factor (VIF) > 10]. A nomogram model was 
constructed using the 12 variables mentioned above. The nomogram model predicted 
the C-index and its 95% confidence interval (95%CI) of in-hospital mortality in 
patients with sepsis complicated with acute pulmonary embolism better than SOFA 
score and sPESI [0.771 (0.725-0.816) vs. 0.579 (0.519-0.639), 0.608 
(0.554-0.663)]. The ROC curve showed that the area under the curve (AUC) and its 
95%CI of the nomogram model were higher than those of the SOFA score and sPESI 
[0.811 (0.766-0.857) vs. 0.630 (0.568-0.691), 0.623 (0.566-0.680)]. These 
findings were consistently replicated in the internal validation of the testing 
set. In both the training and testing sets, Delong's test showed that the AUC of 
the nomogram model was significantly higher than the SOFA score and sPESI (both 
P < 0.05).
CONCLUSION: The nomogram model demonstrated good predictive effectiveness for 
the risk of in-hospital mortality in patients with sepsis complicated with acute 
pulmonary embolism, enabling clinicians to predict mortality risk in advance and 
take timely interventions to reduce mortality.

BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: Patients who survive sepsis in the intensive care unit 
(ICU) (sepsis survivors) have an increased risk of long-term mortality and ICU 
readmission. We aim to identify the risk factors for in-hospital mortality in 
sepsis survivors with later ICU readmission and visualize the quantitative 
relationship between the individual risk factors and mortality by applying 
machine learning (ML) algorithm.
METHODS: Data were obtained from the Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care 
III (MIMIC-III) database for sepsis and non-sepsis ICU survivors who were later 
readmitted to the ICU. The data on the first day of ICU readmission and the 
in-hospital mortality was combined for the ML algorithm modeling and the SHapley 
Additive exPlanations (SHAP) value of the correlation between the risk factors 
and the outcome.
RESULTS: Among the 2970 enrolled patients, in-hospital mortality during ICU 
readmission was significantly higher in sepsis survivors (n = 2228) than 
nonsepsis survivors (n = 742) (50.4% versus 30.7%, P<0.001). The ML algorithm 
identified 18 features that were associated with a risk of mortality in these 
groups; among these, BUN, age, weight, and minimum heart rate were shared by 
both groups, and the remaining mean systolic pressure, urine output, albumin, 
platelets, lactate, activated partial thromboplastin time (APTT), potassium, 
pCO2, pO2, respiration rate, Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) score for eye-opening, 
anion gap, sex and temperature were specific to previous sepsis survivors. The 
ML algorithm also calculated the quantitative contribution and noteworthy 
threshold of each factor to the risk of mortality in sepsis survivors.
CONCLUSION: 14 specific parameters with corresponding thresholds were found to 
be associated with the in-hospital mortality of sepsis survivors during the ICU 
readmission. The construction of advanced ML techniques could support the 
analysis and development of predictive models that can be used to support the 
decisions and treatment strategies made in a clinical setting in critical care 
patients.

This study applied machine learning for the early prediction of 30-day mortality 
at sepsis diagnosis time in critically ill patients. Retrospective study using 
data collected from the Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care IV database. 
The data of the patient cohort was divided on the basis of the year of 
hospitalization, into training (2008-2013), validation (2014-2016), and testing 
(2017-2019) datasets. 24,377 patients with the sepsis diagnosis time < 24 h 
after intensive care unit (ICU) admission were included. A gradient boosting 
tree-based algorithm (XGBoost) was used for training the machine learning model 
to predict 30-day mortality at sepsis diagnosis time in critically ill patients. 
Model performance was measured in both discrimination and calibration aspects. 
The model was interpreted using the SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) module. 
The 30-day mortality rate of the testing dataset was 17.9%, and 39 features were 
selected for the machine learning model. Model performance on the testing 
dataset achieved an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve 
(AUROC) of 0.853 (95% CI 0.837-0.868) and an area under the precision-recall 
curves of 0.581 (95% CI 0.541-0.619). The calibration plot for the model 
revealed a slope of 1.03 (95% CI 0.94-1.12) and intercept of 0.14 (95% CI 
0.04-0.25). The SHAP revealed the top three most significant features, namely 
age, increased red blood cell distribution width, and respiratory rate. Our 
study demonstrated the feasibility of using the interpretable machine learning 
model to predict mortality at sepsis diagnosis time.

INTRODUCTION: The purpose of the present study was to evaluate the potential 
relationship of lymphocyte-to-monocyte ratio (LMR) with outcomes of septic 
patients at intensive care unit (ICU) admission.
MATERIAL AND METHODS: 3087 septic patients were included in the final cohort by 
using the Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care (MIMIC) database. We 
evaluated the association of different groups of LMRmax with 28-day survival and 
1-year survival via Kaplan-Meier (K-M) analysis and Cox regression analysis. 
Subgroups analysis of LMRmax was performed to further explore the effect of 
LMRmax on survival.
RESULTS: According to the optimal cut-off value, the cohort was divided into 
low-LMRmax and high-LMRmax groups. The 28-day and 1-year survival rates were 
47.9% and 19.9%, respectively, in the low-LMRmax group, and 60.4% and 25.9%, 
respectively, in the high-LMRmax group. Univariate logistic regression and K-M 
analyses revealed that the 28-day and 1-year survival rates of the high-LMRmax 
group were higher than those of the low-LMRmax group (both p < 0.001). A 
subgroup analysis of LMRmax identified a significant stepwise decrease in the 
risk of death at 28 days and 1 year from group 1 to group 4 (LMRmax increased 
gradually) after adjustment for multiple variables.
CONCLUSIONS: We report for the first time that a lower LMRmax value is 
independently predictive of a poor prognosis in septic patients. Therefore, as 
an inexpensive and readily available indicator, LMRmax may facilitate 
stratification of prognosis in septic patients.

Background: Sepsis-associated acute kidney injury (AKI) is frequent in patients 
admitted to intensive care units (ICU) and may contribute to adverse short-term 
and long-term outcomes. Acute kidney disease (AKD) reflects the adverse events 
developing after AKI. We aimed to develop and validate machine learning models 
to predict the occurrence of AKD in patients with sepsis-associated AKI. 
Methods: Using clinical data from patients with sepsis in the ICU at Beijing 
Friendship Hospital (BFH), we studied whether the following three machine 
learning models could predict the occurrence of AKD using demographic, 
laboratory, and other related variables: Recurrent Neural Network-Long 
Short-Term Memory (RNN-LSTM), decision trees, and logistic regression. In 
addition, we externally validated the results in the Medical Information Mart 
for Intensive Care III (MIMIC III) database. The outcome was the diagnosis of 
AKD when defined as AKI prolonged for 7-90 days according to Acute Disease 
Quality Initiative-16. Results: In this study, 209 patients from BFH were 
included, with 55.5% of them diagnosed as having AKD. Furthermore, 509 patients 
were included from the MIMIC III database, of which 46.4% were diagnosed as 
having AKD. Applying machine learning could successfully achieve very high 
accuracy (RNN-LSTM AUROC = 1; decision trees AUROC = 0.954; logistic regression 
AUROC = 0.728), with RNN-LSTM showing the best results. Further analyses 
revealed that the change of non-renal Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (SOFA) 
score between the 1st day and 3rd day (Δnon-renal SOFA) is instrumental in 
predicting the occurrence of AKD. Conclusion: Our results showed that machine 
learning, particularly RNN-LSTM, can accurately predict AKD occurrence. In 
addition, Δ SOFAnon-renal plays an important role in predicting the occurrence 
of AKD.

BACKGROUND: Sepsis is an important public health issue, and it is urgent to 
develop valuable indicators to predict the prognosis of sepsis. Our study aims 
to assess the predictive value of ICU admission 
(Neutrophil + Monocyte)/lymphocyte ratio (NMLR) on the 30-day mortality of 
sepsis patients.
METHODS: A retrospective analysis was conducted in septic patients, and the data 
were collected from Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care IV (MIMIC-IV). 
Univariate and multivariate Cox regression analyses were conducted to 
investigate the relation between ICU admission NMLR and 30-day mortality. 
Restricted cubic spline (RCS) was performed to determine the optimum cut-off 
value of ICU admission NMLR. Survival outcomes of the two groups with different 
ICU admission NMLR levels were estimated using the Kaplan-Meier method and 
compared by the log-rank test.
RESULTS: Finally, 7292 patients were recruited in the study, of which 1601 died 
within 30 days of discharge. The non-survival group had higher ICU admission 
NMLR values than patients in the survival group (12.24 [6.44-23.67] vs. 8.71 
[4.81-16.26], P < 0.001). Univariate and multivariate Cox regression analysis 
demonstrated that ICU admission NMLR was an independent prognostic predictor on 
30-day mortality (Univariate: P < 0.001; multivariate: P = 0.011). The RCS model 
demonstrated the upturn and non-linear relationship between ICU admission NMLR 
and 30-day mortality (Nonlinearity: P = 0.0124). According to the KM curve 
analysis,30-day survival was worse in the higher ICU admission NMLR group than 
that in the lower ICU admission NMLR group (Log rank test, P < 0.0001).
CONCLUSION: The elevated ICU admission NMLR level is an independent risk factor 
for high 30-day mortality in patients with sepsis.

Retrospective Analysis: Exploring Transfusion Thresholds' Impact on Patients 
with Sepsis and Renal Failure.

Zhao H, Cheng H, Huang C, Huang M, Li D, Mei F.

BACKGROUND: Sepsis with renal failure is a common condition in intensive care 
units (ICUs) and is associated with poor prognosis. A unified consensus on the 
optimal transfusion hemoglobin concentration threshold is needed to improve 
outcomes. This study investigated the effects of different transfusion 
thresholds during hospitalization on the prognosis of patients with sepsis and 
renal failure.
METHODS: A total of 2,972 patients were included in this study. By using the 
Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care (MIMIC-IV) database, data from 
patients with sepsis and renal failure were screened and divided into a 
low-threshold group (Hb ≤ 7 g/dL) and a high-threshold group (Hb > 7 g/dL) based 
on the average hemoglobin (Hb) level 24 hours before transfusion. Univariate and 
multivariate Cox regression analyses and inverse probability weighting were used 
to compare in-hospital and ICU mortality rates between the two groups. 
Additionally, 30-day, 60-day, and 90-day survival rates, length of hospital 
stay, and ICU stay duration were evaluated.
RESULTS: Statistically significant differences in baseline characteristics were 
observed between the two groups. After propensity score matching to eliminate 
baseline characteristic differences, it was found that among the Cau¬casian 
population a higher transfusion threshold significantly reduced the risk of 
in-hospital mortality (HR, 0.774; 95% CI: 0.613 - 0.978, p < 0.05).
CONCLUSIONS: For patients with sepsis and renal failure, transfusion thresholds 
should be determined by considering the patient's race to achieve individualized 
transfusion strategies.

We aimed to determine the association between anion gap-to-calcium ratio (ACR) 
and 30-day mortality in sepsis patients with diabetes mellitus (DM). Data for 
sepsis patients diagnosed with DM was extracted from Medical Information Mart 
for Intensive Care Database IV. After screening, 4429 eligible subjects were 
included in our study finally. The receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve 
was used to determine the cut-off value. According to the ROC curve analysis, 
the ACR demonstrated a higher area under the curve (AUC) of 0.622 compared to AG 
(0.598). Multivariable logistic regression with inverse probability of treatment 
weighting (IPTW) based on propensity score were used to detect the association 
between ACR and 30-day mortality. Our results showed that the patients with the 
high level of ACR had a higher risk of death within 30 days compared with those 
with low level of ACR (odds ratio 1.342, 95% confidence interval 1.180-1.526, 
P < 0.001). In a word, our results suggest that ACR may be an independent 
prognostic indicator for death with 30 days in critically ill patients with 
sepsis and DM.

BACKGROUND: Sepsis-induced coagulopathy (SIC) is a severe complication of 
sepsis, characterized by poor prognosis and high mortality. However, the 
predictive factors for the development of SIC in sepsis patients remain to be 
determined. The aim of this study was to develop an easy-to-use and efficient 
nomogram for predicting the risk of sepsis patients developing SIC in the 
intensive care unit (ICU), based on common indicators and complications observed 
at admission.
METHODS: A total of 12, 455 sepsis patients from the MIMIC database were 
screened and randomly divided into training and validation cohorts. In the 
training cohort, LASSO regression was used for variable selection and 
regularization. The selected variables were then incorporated into a 
multivariable logistic regression model to construct the nomogram for predicting 
the risk of sepsis patients developing sepsis-induced coagulopathy (SIC). The 
model's predictive performance was evaluated using the area under the receiver 
operating characteristic curve (AUC), and its calibration was assessed through a 
calibration curve. Additionally, decision curve analysis (DCA) was performed to 
evaluate the clinical applicability of the model. External validation was 
conducted using data from the ICU database of Xingtai People's Hospital.
RESULTS: Among the 12, 455 sepsis patients, 5, 145 (41. 3%) developed SIC. The 
occurrence of SIC was significantly associated with the SOFA score, red blood 
cell count, red cell distribution width (RDW), white blood cell count, platelet 
count, INR, and lactate levels. Additionally, hypertension was identified as a 
potential protective factor. A nomogram was developed to predict the risk of 
SIC, which showed an AUC of 0. 81 (95% CI: 0. 79-0. 83) in the training set, 0. 
83 (95% CI: 0. 82-0. 84) in the validation set, and 0. 79 (95% CI: 0. 74-0. 84) 
in the external validation. The calibration curve of the nomogram showed good 
consistency between the observed and predicted probabilities of SIC.
CONCLUSIONS: The novel nomogram demonstrates excellent predictive performance 
for the incidence of SIC in ICU patients with sepsis and holds promise for 
assisting clinicians in early identification and intervention of SIC.

BACKGROUND: High sepsis mortality rates pose a serious global health problem. 
Machine learning is a promising technique with the potential to improve 
mortality prediction for this disease in an accurate and timely manner.
OBJECTIVES: This study aimed to develop a model capable of rapidly and 
accurately predicting sepsis mortality using data that can be quickly obtained 
in an ambulance, with a focus on practical application during ambulance 
transport.
MATERIAL AND METHODS: Data from the Medical Information Mart for Intensive 
Care-IV (MIMIC-IV) dataset were used to compare the performance of 11 machine 
learning algorithms against the widely utilized quick Sequential Organ Failure 
Assessment (qSOFA) score. A dynamic updating model was implemented. Performance 
was evaluated using area under the curve (AUC) and precision-recall area under 
the curve (PRAUC) scores, and feature importance was assessed with SHapley 
Additive exPlanations (SHAP) values.
RESULTS: The light gradient boosting machine (LightGBM) model achieved the 
highest AUC (0.79) and PRAUC (0.44) scores, outperforming the qSOFA score (AUC = 
0.76, PRAUC = 0.40). The LightGBM also achieved the highest PRAUC (0.44), 
followed by Optuna_LightGBM (0.43) and random forest (0.42). The dynamically 
updated and tuned model further improved performance metrics (AUC = 0.79, PRAUC 
= 0.44) compared to the base model (AUC = 0.76, PRAUC = 0.39). Feature 
importance analysis offers clinicians insights for prioritizing patient 
assessments and interventions.
CONCLUSIONS: The LightGBM-based model demonstrated superior performance in 
predicting sepsis-related mortality in an ambulance setting. This study 
underscores the practical applicability of machine learning models, addressing 
the limitations of previous research, and highlights the importance of real-time 
updates and hyperparameter tuning in optimizing model performance.

OBJECTIVE: To construct and validate the best predictive model for 28-day death 
risk in patients with septic shock based on different supervised machine 
learning algorithms.
METHODS: The patients with septic shock meeting the Sepsis-3 criteria were 
selected from Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care-IV v2.0 (MIMIC-IV 
v2.0). According to the principle of random allocation, 70% of these patients 
were used as the training set, and 30% as the validation set. Relevant 
predictive variables were extracted from three aspects: demographic 
characteristics and basic vital signs, serum indicators within 24 hours of 
intensive care unit (ICU) admission and complications possibly affecting 
indicators, functional scoring and advanced life support. The predictive 
efficacy of models constructed using five mainstream machine learning algorithms 
including decision tree classification and regression tree (CART), random forest 
(RF), support vector machine (SVM), linear regression (LR), and super learner 
[SL; combined CART, RF and extreme gradient boosting (XGBoost)] for 28-day death 
in patients with septic shock was compared, and the best algorithm model was 
selected. The optimal predictive variables were determined by intersecting the 
results from LASSO regression, RF, and XGBoost algorithms, and a predictive 
model was constructed. The predictive efficacy of the model was validated by 
drawing receiver operator characteristic curve (ROC curve), the accuracy of the 
model was assessed using calibration curves, and the practicality of the model 
was verified through decision curve analysis (DCA).
RESULTS: A total of 3 295 patients with septic shock were included, with 2 164 
surviving and 1 131 dying within 28 days, resulting in a mortality of 34.32%. Of 
these, 2 307 were in the training set (with 792 deaths within 28 days, a 
mortality of 34.33%), and 988 in the validation set (with 339 deaths within 28 
days, a mortality of 34.31%). Five machine learning models were established 
based on the training set data. After including variables at three aspects, the 
area under the ROC curve (AUC) of RF, SVM, and LR machine learning algorithm 
models for predicting 28-day death in septic shock patients in the validation 
set was 0.823 [95% confidence interval (95%CI) was 0.795-0.849], 0.823 (95%CI 
was 0.796-0.849), and 0.810 (95%CI was 0.782-0.838), respectively, which were 
higher than that of the CART algorithm model (AUC = 0.750, 95%CI was 
0.717-0.782) and SL algorithm model (AUC = 0.756, 95%CI was 0.724-0.789). Thus 
above three algorithm models were determined to be the best algorithm models. 
After integrating variables from three aspects, 16 optimal predictive variables 
were identified through intersection by LASSO regression, RF, and XGBoost 
algorithms, including the highest pH value, the highest albumin (Alb), the 
highest body temperature, the lowest lactic acid (Lac), the highest Lac, the 
highest serum creatinine (SCr), the highest Ca2+, the lowest hemoglobin (Hb), 
the lowest white blood cell count (WBC), age, simplified acute physiology score 
III (SAPS III), the highest WBC, acute physiology score III (APS III), the 
lowest Na+, body mass index (BMI), and the shortest activated partial 
thromboplastin time (APTT) within 24 hours of ICU admission. ROC curve analysis 
showed that the Logistic regression model constructed with above 16 optimal 
predictive variables was the best predictive model, with an AUC of 0.806 (95%CI 
was 0.778-0.835) in the validation set. The calibration curve and DCA curve 
showed that this model had high accuracy and the highest net benefit could reach 
0.3, which was significantly outperforming traditional models based on single 
functional score [APS III score, SAPS III score, and sequential organ failure 
assessment (SOFA) score] with AUC (95%CI) of 0.746 (0.715-0.778), 0.765 
(0.734-0.796), and 0.625 (0.589-0.661), respectively.
CONCLUSIONS: The Logistic regression model, constructed using 16 optimal 
predictive variables including pH value, Alb, body temperature, Lac, SCr, Ca2+, 
Hb, WBC, SAPS III score, APS III score, Na+, BMI, and APTT, is identified as the 
best predictive model for the 28-day death risk in patients with septic shock. 
Its performance is stable, with high discriminative ability and accuracy.

Urine Output Calculated Using Actual Body Weight May Result in Overestimation of 
Acute Kidney Injury for Obese Patients.

GOAL: The derived hourly urine output (UO) indexed by body weight is one of the 
major criteria for the diagnosis of acute kidney injury (AKI). However, it is 
unclear whether actual body weight (ABW) or ideal body weight (IBW) should be 
used. This study aims to explore whether UO calculation based on ABW might lead 
to overestimation of AKI.
METHOD: AKI patients identified in the Medical Information Mart for Intensive 
Care III database by different components of the Kidney Disease Improving Global 
Outcomes guidelines and different definitions of body weight were 
retrospectively studied. Hospital and 90-day mortality were compared to decide 
whether different patient groups had the same outcome.
RESULTS: In the cohort of 14,725 patients, AKI was identified in 4,298 (29.19%) 
and 3,060 (20.78%) patients respectively when ABW or IBW was used (P < 0.01). 
Multivariate logistic regression revealed that AKI patients identified by UO 
calculated from ABW had similar hospital and 90-day mortality to that of 
patients with no evidence of AKI. Whereas AKI patients identified by serum 
creatinine changes, or those identified by both ABW and IBW, had twice higher 
the risks of hospital death and about 1.5 times higher the risks of 90-day death 
compared with thoese with no evidence of AKI. Results were confirmed in two 
separate sensitivity analyses where patients whose admission creatinine levels 
were within the normal reference ranges and patients identified as sepsis were 
studied.
CONCLUSIONS: Calculating hourly body weight normalized UO using ABW may lead to 
underestimation of UO and overestimation of AKI.

Individuals afflicted with heart failure complicated by sepsis often experience 
a surge in blood glucose levels, a phenomenon known as stress hyperglycemia. 
However, the correlation between this condition and overall mortality remains 
unclear. 869 individuals with heart failure complicated by sepsis were 
identified from the Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care-IV (MIMIC-IV) 
database and categorized into five cohorts based on their stress hyperglycemia 
ratio (SHR). The primary endpoints evaluated were mortality within the intensive 
care unit (ICU), all-cause mortality within 28 days, and all-cause mortality 
during hospitalization. Cox proportional hazards regression and restricted cubic 
spline analyses were employed to unravel the association between SHR and 
mortality. The ICU mortality, in-hospital mortality, and 28-day all-cause 
mortality were 10.01%, 13.69%, and 16.46%, respectively. Multivariable Cox 
proportional hazards regression analysis revealed a significant association 
between elevated SHR and all-cause mortality. After adjusting for confounding 
variables, elevated SHR was significantly associated with increased risk of ICU 
mortality (hazard ratio [HR] = 1.67; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.03-2.70)), 
in-hospital mortality (HR = 1.53; 95% CI, 1.00-2.33)), and 28-day all-cause 
mortality (HR = 1.49; 95% CI, 1.02-2.17)). Restricted cubic spline analysis 
demonstrated a significant U-shaped relationship between SHR and the risk of 
all-cause mortality. This study revealed that stress hyperglycemia ratio is an 
independent prognostic factor in patients with heart failure complicated by 
sepsis. Notably, both very high and very low SHR values were associated with 
increased mortality risk.

OBJECTIVE: In this study, we aimed to explore the relationship between serum 
phosphate and clinical outcomes in sepsis with E.Coli infection based on a 
public database in order to help physicians do individualized medical decisions.
METHODS: We performed this retrospective study based on the Medical Information 
Mart for Intensive Care IV(MIMIC-IV) database (https://mimic.mit.edu/iv/). All 
the patients were hospitalized and serum phosphate was measured in 24 hours 
after hospitalization. E.Coli infection was confirmed by the positive blood 
culture of E.Coli in the database. Three models were utilized to investigate the 
relationship between serum phosphate and mortality in sepsis as follows: crude 
model (adjusted for none), model I (adjusted for age and gender) and model II 
(adjusted for all potential confounders). The smooth fitting curve was performed 
by the generalized additive model.
RESULTS: 421 adult sepsis patients with E.Coli infection were included. The 
28-day mortality was 10.69%(n=45). The median age was 70 and the proportion of 
males was 47.51%(n=200). The smooth fitting curve showed that the relationship 
between serum phosphate and 28-day mortality in sepsis with E.Coli infection was 
positive. When serum phosphate >2.1mg/dl, the relationship was significantly 
positive (OR=1.55, 95%CI:1.01-2.36, P=0.043).
CONCLUSION: The positive relationship between serum phosphate and 28-day 
mortality in adult sepsis patients with E.Coli infection was found based on 
MIMIC-IV database.

Purpose: This study aims to establish and validate machine learning-based models 
to predict death in hospital among critical orthopaedic trauma patients with 
sepsis or respiratory failure.Methods: This study collected 523 patients from 
the Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care database. All patients were 
randomly classified into a training cohort and a validation cohort. Six 
algorithms, including logistic regression (LR), extreme gradient boosting 
machine (eXGBM), support vector machine (SVM), random forest (RF), neural 
network (NN), and decision tree (DT), were used to develop and optimize models 
in the training cohort, and internal validation of these models were conducted 
in the validation cohort. Based on a comprehensive scoring system, which 
incorporated ten evaluation metrics, the optimal model was obtained with the 
highest scores. An artificial intelligence (AI) application was deployed based 
on the optimal model in the study.Results: The in-hospital mortality was 19.69%. 
Among all developed models, the eXGBM had the highest area under the curve (AUC) 
value (0.951, 95%CI: 0.934-0.967), and it also showed the highest accuracy 
(0.902), precise (0.893), recall (0.915), and F1 score (0.904). Based on the 
scoring system, the eXGBM had the highest score of 53, followed by the RF model 
(43) and the NN model (39). The scores for the LR, SVM, and DT were 22, 36, and 
17, respectively. The decision curve analysis confirmed that both the eXGBM and 
RF models provided substantial clinical net benefits. However, the eXGBM model 
consistently outperformed the RF model across multiple evaluation metrics, 
establishing itself as the superior option for predictive modeling in this 
scenario, with the RF model as a strong secondary choice. The SHAP analysis 
revealed that SAPS II, age, respiratory rate, OASIS, and temperature were the 
most important five features contributing to the outcome.Conclusions: This study 
develops an artificial intelligence application to predict in-hospital mortality 
among critical orthopaedic trauma patients with sepsis or respiratory failure.

BACKGROUND: Postoperative fever is common. However, it can sometimes indicate 
severe complications such as sepsis or pneumonia. Intensive care unit (ICU) 
patients who have undergone abdominal surgery have a higher risk of 
postoperative fever due the physical severity of this type of surgery. 
Nevertheless, determining when more aggressive or invasive management of fever 
is necessary remains a challenge.
METHODS: We analyzed the Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care (MIMIC)-IV 
and MIMIC-IV-Note databases, which are open critical care big databases from a 
single institute in the United States. From this, we selected ICU patients who 
developed fever after intra-abdominal surgery and classified these patients into 
two groups using cluster analysis based on diverse variables from the MIMIC-IV 
databases. Following this cluster analysis, we assessed differences among the 
identified groups.
RESULTS: Of 2,858 ICU stays after intra-abdominal surgery, 331 postoperative 
fever cases were identified. These patients were clustered into two groups. 
Group A included older patients with a higher mortality rate, while group B 
consisted of younger patients with a lower mortality rate.
CONCLUSIONS: Postoperative ICU patients with a fever could be classified into 
two distinct groups, a high-risk group and low-risk group. The high-risk patient 
group was characterized by older age, higher Sequential Organ Failure Assessment 
(SOFA) score, and more unstable hemodynamic status, indicating the need for 
aggressive management. Clustering postoperative fever patients by clinical 
variables can support medical decision-making and targeted treatment to improve 
patient outcomes.

BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: There are several disease severity scores being used 
for the prediction of mortality in critically ill patients. However, none of 
them was developed and validated specifically for patients with severe sepsis. 
The present study aimed to develop a novel prediction score for severe sepsis.
RESULTS: A total of 3206 patients with severe sepsis were enrolled, including 
1054 non-survivors and 2152 survivors. The LASSO score showed the best 
discrimination (area under curve: 0.772; 95% confidence interval: 0.735-0.810) 
in the validation cohort as compared with other scores such as simplified acute 
physiology score II, acute physiological score III, Logistic organ dysfunction 
system, sequential organ failure assessment score, and Oxford Acute Severity of 
Illness Score. The calibration slope was 0.889 and Brier value was 0.173.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: The study employed a single center database called 
Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care-III) MIMIC-III for analysis. Severe 
sepsis was defined as infection and acute organ dysfunction. Clinical and 
laboratory variables used in clinical routines were included for screening. 
Subjects without missing values were included, and the whole dataset was split 
into training and validation cohorts. The score was coined LASSO score because 
variable selection was performed using the least absolute shrinkage and 
selection operator (LASSO) technique. Finally, the LASSO score was evaluated for 
its discrimination and calibration in the validation cohort.
CONCLUSIONS: The study developed the LASSO score for mortality prediction in 
patients with severe sepsis. Although the score had good discrimination and 
calibration in a randomly selected subsample, external validations are still 
required.

Sepsis-associated encephalopathy (SAE) is defined as a dysfunction of the 
central nervous system experienced during sepsis with variable clinical 
features. The study aims to identify the prognostic role of urinary ketone 
bodies in relation to clinical outcomes in patients with SAE. The Medical 
Information Mart for Intensive Care III (MIMIC-III) database was used to conduct 
a retrospective cohort study. We recruited 427 patients with SAE admitted to the 
intensive care unit (ICU) from the MIMIC-III database. Patients with SAE were 
divided into a survival group (380 patients) and a non-survival group (47 
patients). We used the Wilcoxon signed-rank test and the multivariate logistic 
regression analysis to analyze the relationship between the level of urinary 
ketone bodies and the clinical prognosis in patients with SAE. The primary 
outcome was the relationship between urinary ketone body levels and 28-day 
mortality of SAE. The secondary outcomes were the relationship between urinary 
ketone body levels and length of ICU stays, Simplified Acute Physiology Score 
II, Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (SOFA), Glasgow Coma Scale, mechanical 
ventilation, renal replacement therapy, and the use of vasopressors. The 28-day 
mortality of patients with SAE was 11.0%. Urinary ketone body levels were not 
significantly associated with the 28-day mortality of patients with SAE. Urinary 
ketone body levels were associated with SOFA score and the use of vasopressors 
in patients with SAE. The SOFA score was an independent risk factor for the 
28-day mortality in patients with SAE. Urinary ketone body levels were 
significantly associated with SOFA score and the use of vasopressors in patients 
with SAE. Furthermore, the SOFA score can predict the prognosis of short-term 
outcomes of patients with SAE. Therefore, we should closely monitor the changes 
of urinary ketone bodies and SOFA score and intervene in time.

BACKGROUND: Recent studies showed histamine H2 receptor antagonists (H2RAs) 
exposure was associated with reduced mortality in heart failure (HF) patients. 
However, specific HF patients who are sensitive to H2RAs exposure or not are yet 
to be further defined.
AIM: This study aimed to identify HF patient characteristics that may benefit 
from H2RAs exposure.
METHOD: Neural network-based variational autoencoders and Gaussian Mixture Model 
(GMM) clustering methods were employed to classify the critically ill patients 
with HF exposed to H2RAs based on Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care 
III and IV databases. Binary logistic and multivariable Cox regression analysis 
based on propensity score matching (PSM) were employed to estimate the 
association between H2RAs exposure of each cluster and all-cause mortality of 
included patients.
RESULTS: A total of 9,585 H2RAs users among 23,855 included HF patients were 
identified into four clusters according to GMM clustering: cluster 1 (combined 
with acute kidney failure, septic shock, and pneumonia), cluster 2 (combined 
with atrial fibrillation), cluster 3 (combined with coronary artery disease 
(CAD) and/or had higher urine output), and cluster 4 (co-administered with 
calcium-antagonists). The cluster 3 patients were significantly associated with 
reduced all-cause mortality compared with non-H2RAs users after PSM, which were 
further validated in 14,280 HF patients from the large multi-center electronic 
intensive care unit Collaborative Research Database (eICU-CRD).
CONCLUSION: Histamine H2 receptor antagonist exposure was more sensitive in HF 
patients who were combined with CAD. Furthermore, male HF patients or those with 
higher urine output were also sensitive to H2RAs exposure.

Pulmonary Diseases, Sun Yat-sen University, Guangzhou, Guangdong, People's 
Republic of China.

BACKGROUND: Sepsis is a life-threatening and inflammatory disease with high 
morbidity and mortality. Red blood cell distribution width to platelet count 
ratio (RPR) was known as an inflammatory biomarker and was related to poor 
outcomes of various diseases.
AIM: This study was intended to explore the association between RPR and 
mortality of sepsis patients.
METHODS: A retrospective cohort study was undertaken in patients with sepsis, 
and the data were collected from a public database called Medical Information 
Mart for Intensive Care III (MIMIC-III). The primary outcome was 28-day 
mortality while the secondary outcomes were 90-day mortality and ICU mortality. 
Multivariable regression analyses, as well as interaction and stratified 
analyses, were conducted to investigate the relation between RPR and sepsis 
mortality.
RESULTS: In total, we enrolled 7531 patients with 1316 deaths. RPR was 
independently correlated with 28-day mortality (per 0.1 increase: HR=1.04; 95% 
CI 1.02-1.06), 90-day mortality (per 0.1 increase: HR=1.04; 95% CI 1.03-1.06) 
and ICU mortality (per 0.1 increase: OR=1.06; 95% CI 1.02-1.10). 
Twenty-eight-day survival was worse in the high RPR (≥0.134) group according to 
the Kaplan-Meier curve analyses (Log rank test, p<0.001). In stratified 
analyses, Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (SOFA) score and length of ICU 
stay had interactive effects with the high RPR (≥0.134) group on 28-day 
mortality.
CONCLUSION: RPR is a novel biomarker that indicates poor prognosis of sepsis 
patients. Clinicians are required to pay more attention to those patients with 
high RPR.

BACKGROUND: This study sought to investigate the relationship between early 
administration of dexmedetomidine (DEX) and the risk of acute respiratory 
distress syndrome (ARDS) in sepsis patients in the intensive care unit (ICU).
METHOD: The study was a retrospective cohort study. We extracted and obtained 
data on sepsis patients from the Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care IV 
(MIMIC-IV) database. The primary exposure of interest was the administration of 
DEX, and the primary outcome was the occurrence of ARDS. Univariable and 
multivariable Logistic regression analyses were conducted to adjust for 
confounding factors.
RESULTS: A total of 6,220 sepsis patients were included in the study, of which 
1,071 (17.22%) developed ARDS. Multivariable logistic regression analysis 
revealed that early administration of DEX was associated with a lower risk of 
ARDS [odds ratio (OR) = 0.74, 95% confidence interval (CI): 0.55-0.99]. 
Additionally, compared to sepsis patients who did not receive DEX, those with 
shorter durations of DEX treatment had a lower risk of developing ARDS 
(OR = 0.54, 95% CI: 0.34-0.85). Subgroup analysis indicated that among sepsis 
patients younger than 65 years old, males, and those without comorbidities 
(hypertension, diabetes, chronic kidney disease), a shorter duration of DEX use 
was associated with a lower risk of ARDS in sepsis patients.
CONCLUSION: The early administration of DEX was associated with the risk of ARDS 
in sepsis patients within 24 hours of ICU admission, suggesting that DEX may 
play a significant role in the health management of sepsis patients.

BACKGROUND: Atrial fibrillation (AF) portends poor prognoses in intensive care 
unit patients with sepsis. However, AF research is challenging: Previous studies 
demonstrate that International Classification of Disease (ICD) codes may 
underestimate the incidence of AF, but chart review is expensive and often not 
feasible. We aim to examine the accuracy of nurse-charted AF and its temporal 
precision in critical care patients with sepsis.
METHODS: Patients with sepsis with continuous electrocardiogram (ECG) waveforms 
were identified from the Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care (MIMIC-III) 
database, a de-identified, single-center intensive care unit electronic health 
record (EHR) source. We selected a random sample of ECGs of 6 to 50 hours' 
duration for manual review. Nurse-charted AF occurrence and onset time and 
ICD-9-coded AF were compared to gold-standard ECG adjudication by a 
board-certified cardiac electrophysiologist blinded to AF status. Descriptive 
statistics were calculated for all variables in patients diagnosed with AF by 
nurse charting, ICD-9 code, or both.
RESULTS: From 142 ECG waveforms (58 AF and 84 sinus rhythm), nurse charting 
identified AF events with 93% sensitivity (95% confidence interval [CI]: 
87%-100%) and 87% specificity (95% CI: 80%-94%) compared to the gold standard 
manual ECG review. Furthermore, nurse-charted AF onset time was within 1 hour of 
expert reader onset time for 85% of the reviewed tracings. The ICD-9 codes were 
97% sensitive (95% CI: 88-100%) and 82% specific (95% CI: 74-90%) for incident 
AF during admission but unable to identify AF time of onset.
CONCLUSION: Nurse documentation of AF in EHR is accurate and has high precision 
for determining AF onset to within 1 hour. Our study suggests that nurse-charted 
AF in the EHR represents a potentially novel method for AF case identification, 
timing, and burden estimation.

Associations of propofol and midazolam with the 30-day mortality in patients 
with sepsis-associated encephalopathy: A study of the MIMIC database.

BACKGROUND: Propofol and midazolam have been widely used in patients with 
sepsis. However, the effectiveness of these drugs in reducing the duration of 
mechanical ventilation and the risk of mortality remains controversial.
OBJECTIVES: To investigate and compare effects of propofol and midazolam on 
30-day mortality in patients with sepsis-associated encephalopathy (SAE).
MATERIAL AND METHODS: A retrospective cohort study was conducted on data from 
952 adult patients with SAE extracted from the Medical Information Mart for 
Intensive Care IV (MIMIC-IV) database. Univariable and multivariable Cox 
proportional hazard models were utilized to investigate the associations of 
propofol and midazolam with 30-day mortality; and univariable and multivariable 
logistic regression analyses were used to explore the relationships of propofol 
and midazolam with ventilation duration. The outcome measures were hazard ratios 
(HRs), odds ratios (ORs), and 95% confidence intervals (95% CIs). In addition, 
subgroup analyses of age, simplified acute physiological score (SAPS)-II, 
Charlson Comorbidity Index (CCI), and ventilation duration were also performed 
to further assess the associations of propofol and midazolam with 30-day 
mortality.
RESULTS: Among eligible patients, 265 (27.84%) died within 30 days. After 
adjusting for covariates, treatment with propofol was associated with both lower 
risk of 30-day mortality (HR = 0.67, 95% CI: 0.51-0.88) and lower odds of 
prolonged ventilation duration (OR = 0.71, 95% CI: 0.53-0.96) compared to 
treatment with midazolam. Moreover, the negative association between treatment 
with propofol and 30-day mortality was also significant in subgroups of age ≥65 
years, SAPS-II score ≥47, CCI score ≥3, and ventilation duration ≥5 days (all p 
< 0.05).
CONCLUSIONS: Among patients with SAE, treatment with propofol was relatively 
more effective than treatment with midazolam in reducing the risk of 30-day 
mortality and the duration of mechanical ventilation. However, the causal 
relationships of propofol and midazolam with prognosis in patients with SAE need 
further clarification.

BACKGROUND: The dysregulated stress response is a key pathological mechanism 
underlying sepsis and is strongly associated with poor clinical outcomes. Stress 
hyperglycemia, a common manifestation of this response, may provide valuable 
prognostic information in sepsis patients. The stress hyperglycemia ratio (SHR) 
offers a more accurate reflection of the stress response and may be instrumental 
in assessing sepsis prognosis.
METHODS: This study aimed to investigate the relationship between SHRs and 
clinical outcomes in sepsis patients. Data were obtained from the Medical 
Information Mart for Intensive Care IV database. Demographic information, 
intensive care unit (ICU) parameters within the first 24 h, laboratory results, 
insulin administration, survival time, and outcomes were extracted for analysis. 
Four SHR metrics (SHRfirst, SHRmin, SHRmax, and SHRmean) were calculated based 
on blood glucose values during the first 24 h of ICU admission (first, minimum, 
maximum, and mean, respectively). The predictive performance of each SHR metric 
was compared using the area under the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) 
curve. Kaplan-Meier survival analysis was performed to assess survival rates 
across groups defined by ROC curve-generated cut-off values. Associations 
between SHR and 28-day as well as 1-year mortality were further examined using 
both univariate and multivariate Cox regression analyses.
RESULTS: A total of 5,025 sepsis patients were included, of whom 656 died within 
28 days of ICU admission. SHR was significantly higher in the non-survivor 
group. Among the SHR metrics, SHRmax demonstrated the highest predictive value 
for both 28-day and 1-year mortality. Higher SHR values were consistently 
associated with increased mortality (all P < 0.001). For SHRmax, each 1-unit 
increase was associated with a 77% increase in mortality in univariate analysis 
and a 71.6% increase in multivariate analysis. Sensitivity analyses indicated 
that the relationship between SHR and mortality was stronger in patients without 
diabetes.
CONCLUSIONS: SHR serves as a robust marker of the dysregulated stress response 
in sepsis and holds significant prognostic value, particularly SHRmax, in 
predicting mortality. These findings underscore the potential clinical utility 
of SHR in guiding therapeutic strategies aimed at modulating the stress response 
and blood glucose levels in critically ill sepsis patients. Further research is 
warranted to explore SHR-targeted interventions in sepsis management.

INTRODUCTION: So far, no study has investigated the association between 
subclinical hepatic fibrosis and sepsis, especially in terms of prognosis.
OBJECTIVES: The purpose of our study was to explore the association of liver 
fibrosis indexes with the outcomes of septic patients without overt chronic 
liver disease.
PATIENTS AND METHODS: We performed a cohort study using data extracted from the 
Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care III (version 1.4) database. External 
validation was obtained from the First Affiliated Hospital of Wenzhou Medical 
University, China. We calculated the Aspartate Aminotransferase-to-Platelet 
Ratio Index, the Fibrosis‑4 (FIB‑4) score, and the Nonalcoholic Fatty Liver 
Disease Fibrosis Score using the existing formulas. The primary outcome was 
28‑day mortality. We assessed the associations of these 3 indexes with patient 
outcomes using logistic regression analysis.
RESULTS: In the FIB‑4 sepsis cohort (n = 1560), there was a significant stepwise 
increase from quartile 1 to quartile 4 in the risk of 28‑day mortality (quartile 
1: reference; quartile 2: odds ratio [OR], 1.57, P = 0.06, 95% CI, 0.98-2.515; 
quartile 3: OR, 2.363, P <0.001, 95% CI, 1.512-3.692; quartile 4: OR, 2.933, P 
<0.001, 95% CI, 1.895-4.538). The results of multivariable regression, 
Kaplan-Meier, and Cox regression analyses as well as external validation 
exhibited good consistency.
CONCLUSIONS: The FIB‑4 index is associated with 28‑day, 90‑day, and in‑hospital 
mortality as well as with renal replacement therapy in septic patients without 
overt chronic liver disease. In other words, an advanced stage of subclinical 
hepatic fibrosis as represented by the FIB‑4 score indicates poor outcomes in 
patients with sepsis.

BACKGROUND: Fibrinogen plays a pivotal role in the inflammatory cascade and is 
intricately linked to the pathogenesis of sepsis. Nevertheless, its significance 
as a prognostic marker for sepsis-associated acute kidney injury (SA-AKI) 
remains uncertain. This study aimed to investigate the association between 
fibrinogen levels and 28-day mortality with sepsis-associated acute kidney 
injury.
METHOD: The fibrinogen levels of patients admitted to the intensive care unit of 
Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center between 2008 and 2019 were retrospectively 
assessed, and those diagnosed with SA-AKI were divided into low, middle and high 
fibrinogen level groups according to tertiles. Multivariate Cox proportional 
hazards model was used to assess the 28-day mortality risk of the SA-AKI 
patients.
RESULTS: A total of 3,479 patients with SA-AKI were included in the study. 
Fibrinogen demonstrated an independent association with 28-day mortality, 
yielding a hazard ratio (HR) of 0.961 (95% confidence interval [CI]: 
0.923-0.999, P = 0.0471). Notably, a non-linear relationship between fibrinogen 
levels and 28-day mortality was observed, with the threshold observed at 
approximately 1.6 g/l. The effect sizes and corresponding CIs below and above 
this threshold were 0.509 (0.367, 0.707) and 1.011 (0.961, 1.064), respectively. 
Specifically, the risk of mortality among SA-AKI patients decreased by 49.1% for 
every 1 g/l increment in fibrinogen, provided that fibrinogen levels were less 
than 1.6 g/l.
CONCLUSION: In patients with SA-AKI, a non-linear relationship was identified 
between fibrinogen levels and 28-day mortality. Particularly, when their 
fibrinogen levels were less than 1.6 g/l, a concomitant decrease in 28-day 
mortality was observed as fibrinogen levels increased.

AIM: Sepsis-associated encephalopathy (SAE) is a common and serious complication 
of sepsis with poor prognosis. Statin was used in SAE patients, whereas its 
effects on these patients remain unknown. This study is aimed at investigating 
the impact of statins on the 30-day mortality of patients with SAE.
METHODS: In this retrospective cohort study, data from SAE patients were 
extracted from the Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care IV (MIMIC-IV). 
Statins include atorvastatin, pravastatin, rosuvastatin, and simvastatin. The 
outcome was 30-day mortality of SAE patients starting 24 h after the first 
intensive care unit (ICU) admission and at the first time after hospitalization. 
Potential covariates (sociodemographic characteristics, vital signs, score 
indexes, laboratory parameters, comorbidities, and treatment intervention 
methods) were selected using univariate Cox proportional hazard analysis. 
Associations between statin use and statin type and 30-day mortality were 
explored using univariate and multivariate Cox proportional hazard models with 
hazard ratios (HRs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs). Associations were 
further explored in different age groups, sex, sequential organ failure 
assessment (SOFA), simplified acute physiology score II (SAPS II), and systemic 
inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS) populations.
RESULTS: A total of 2,729 SAE patients were included in the study, and 786 
(28.8%) died within 30 days. Statin use was associated with lower odds of 30-day 
mortality (HR = 0.77, 95%CI: 0.66-0.90) in all SAE patients. Patients who took 
simvastatin treatments were associated with lower odds of 30-day mortality 
(HR = 0.58, 95%CI: 0.43-0.78). Rosuvastatin treatments had a higher 30-day 
mortality risk (HR = 1.88, 95%CI: 1.29-2.75). Statin use was also associated 
with lower 30-day mortality among patients of different ages, sex, sequential 
organ failure assessment (SOFA), SAPS II, and SIRS.
CONCLUSION: Patients who were treated with simvastatin were associated with 
lower odds of 30-day mortality in SAE patients. Caution should be paid to statin 
use in SAE patients, particularly in patients treated with rosuvastatin or 
pravastatin.

BACKGROUND: The optimal timing of lactate measurement for septic patients in the 
intensive care unit (ICU) remains controversial, and whether initiating and 
repeating the lactate measurement earlier could make a difference for septic 
patients with an elevated lactate level remains unexplored.
METHODS: This was a retrospective observational study that included septic 
patients with an initial lactate level > 2.0 mmol/L after ICU admission, and all 
data were extracted from the Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care III 
(MIMIC-III) database. The main exposure of interest was the early lactate 
measurement, which was defined as an initial lactate level measurement within 
1 h after ICU admission. The primary outcome was 28-day mortality.
RESULTS: A total of 2642 eligible subjects were enrolled, including 738 patients 
who had initial lactate measurements completed within 1 h (EL group) and 1904 
patients who had initial lactate measurements completed more than 1 h after ICU 
admission (LL group). A significant beneficial effect of early lactate 
measurement in terms of 28-day mortality was observed: the adjusted odds ratio 
(OR) was 0.69 (95% CI 0.55-0.87; p = 0.001), and the mediation effect of the 
time to initial vasopressor administration was significant (average causal 
mediation effect (ACME) - 0.018; 95% CI - 0.005 approximately to - 0.036; 
p < 0.001). A strong relationship between delayed initial lactate measurement 
and risk-adjusted 28-day mortality was noted (OR 1.04; 95% CI 1.02-1.05; 
p < 0.001). Each hour of delay in remeasuring the lactate level was associated 
with an increase in 28-day mortality in the EL group (OR 1.09; 95% CI 1.04-1.15; 
p < 0.001). Further analysis demonstrated that repeating the measurement 3 h 
after the initial lactate measurement led to a significant difference.
CONCLUSIONS: Early lactate measurement is associated with a lower risk-adjusted 
28-day mortality rate in septic patients with lactate levels > 2.0 mmol/L. A 
shorter time to the initial vasopressor administration may contribute to this 
relationship. Repeating the lactate measurement within 3 h after the initial 
measurement is appropriate for patients whose lactate levels were measured 
within 1 h of admission.

BACKGROUND Sepsis-associated acute kidney injury (SA-AKI) is linked to high 
mortality rates and an unfavorable prognosis. Early identification of patients 
with poor prognosis is crucial. This study aimed to investigate the relationship 
between the systemic immune-inflammation index (SII) and mortality in this 
specific patient population. MATERIAL AND METHODS This retrospective cohort 
study used data from the Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care IV 
database. Data on patient demographics, comorbidities, vital signs, laboratory 
parameters, treatment usage, acute kidney injury staging, and renal replacement 
therapy were collected within 48 h of intensive care unit admission. Restricted 
cubic splines, Kaplan-Meier curves, and Cox regression models were used for 
analysis. Stratified analyses were performed on the basis of various factors. 
RESULTS In total, 7856 patients were included, with a median age of 66.9 years 
and a male-to-female ratio of 57.7%-42.3%. A J-shaped relationship was observed 
between SII and mortality risk. The lowest mortality risk occurred at an SII of 
760.078×10⁹/L. Compared to the reference group (second quartile of SII), the 
highest and third quartiles had increased 28-day mortality risk, with adjusted 
hazard ratios (HRs) of 1.33 (1.16-1.52) and 1.55 (1.36-1.77), respectively. 
Although a trend towards higher mortality hazard was observed in the lowest SII 
group (Q1), it was not statistically significant, with an adjusted HR of 1.15 
(1-1.32). CONCLUSIONS In patients with SA-AKI, both low and high SII were 
associated with increased short-term mortality risk. The lowest mortality risk 
was observed at an SII of 760.078×10⁹/L within a 28-day period.

Association between Lactate Dehydrogenase to Albumin Ratio and 28-Day Mortality 
in Patients with Sepsis: a Retrospective Cohort Study.

Liu Z, Liu F, Jie Y, Chen X.

BACKGROUND: This study aims to evaluate the lactate dehydrogenase to albumin 
ratio and mortality at 28 days in patients with sepsis.
METHODS: Data from the Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care IV (MIMIC-IV) 
database were used for this retrospective cohort analysis. The level of the 
lactate dehydrogenase to albumin ratio was recovered at admission and the 
outcome index was mortality at 28 days. Multivariate Cox regression, survival 
curve analysis, and subgroup analysis were used to study the relationship 
between lactate dehydrogenase to albumin ratio and 28-day mortality in sepsis 
patients.
RESULTS: This study included a total of 4,265 patients with sepsis, with a 
28-day mortality rate of 51.9%. After conducting multivariable COX regression 
analysis and adjusting for all potential confounding factors, we observed that 
compared to the LDH/ALB (Q1) group, the Q2 group had a 1.34-fold higher risk of 
28-day mortality (HR = 1.34, 95% CI: 1.20 - 1.49, p < 0.001), while the Q3 group 
had a 1.90-fold higher risk (HR = 1.90, 95% CI: 1.69 - 2.14, p < 0.001). 
Furthermore, the survival analysis curve indicated a gradual increase in the 
28-day mortality rate of septic patients as LDH/ALB levels increased. In 
addition, the ROC curve demonstrated that the area under the curve for LDH/ALB 
was 0.6507 (95% CI: 63.4991% - 66.6368%), which was higher than that of LDH (AUC 
= 0.6434), ALB (AUC = 0.55), and SOFA SCORE (AUC = 0.5564). Finally, subgroup 
analysis revealed no significant interaction between LDH/ALB and the various 
subgroups.
CONCLUSIONS: The LDH/ALB ratio is significantly correlated with mortality at 28 
days in patients with sepsis, which is of significant clinical importance and 
deserves further study.

Aims/Background The role of heparin in sepsis therapy has been widely debated. 
The controversy surrounding heparin's use as an anticoagulant in sepsis may stem 
from differences in sepsis definitions, study designs, timing and dosage of drug 
administration, treatment duration, complications, and patient severity. In this 
study, we aimed to determine the optimal timing and dosage of heparin in 
patients with sepsis, identify specific subgroups that could benefit from 
heparin therapy, and explore laboratory markers to assess its efficacy. Methods 
This retrospective cohort study was conducted using the Medical Information Mart 
for Intensive Care-IV dataset. Data from patients with sepsis were extracted 
based on the Sepsis 3.0 criteria. Patients were categorized according to heparin 
use. The effectiveness of early and appropriate heparin administration was 
assessed, and a subgroup analysis was performed to identify patients most likely 
to benefit from heparin therapy. Additionally, factors mediating the improvement 
in sepsis prognosis following heparin treatment were analyzed. Results We 
recruited 4149 participants who met the inclusion criteria, with an overall 
28-day mortality rate of 19.5%. There were 2192 individuals in the heparin group 
and 1957 in the non-heparin group. After propensity score matching, heparin 
therapy demonstrated a significantly greater effect on reducing both 28-day and 
90-day mortality compared to the non-heparin treatment (18.1% vs. 10.7%, p < 
0.001; 18.8% vs. 12.6%, p < 0.001). However, the heparin group had a higher 
incidence of major bleeding (10.9% vs. 6.3%, p = 0.001), increased use of 
mechanical ventilation (54.3% vs. 45.1%, p < 0.001), and a longer intensive care 
unit stay (3.6 vs. 2.5 days, p < 0.001) compared to the non-heparin group. Early 
administration of high-dose heparin improved 28-day survival. Early and adequate 
heparin administration was more effective than late and insufficient dosing (p < 
0.01), except in patients with sepsis who had low white blood cell counts, 
alkalosis, or reduced platelet counts. The increase in platelet count had a 
significant mediating effect on the entire cohort (p < 0.001 for the causal 
mediation effect), with a mediation proportion of 14%. Conclusion Early and 
adequate heparin administration can significantly improve the prognosis of 
sepsis. An increase in platelet count may serve as a potential indicator of the 
effectiveness of heparin therapy in sepsis.

BACKGROUND: This study investigates the relationship between prolonged elevated 
heart rate (pe-HR) and mortality among patients with sepsis-associated acute 
kidney injury (S-AKI) using causal inference and machine learning.
METHODS: Pe-HR was defined as a heart rate exceeding 100 beats/min for 11 hours 
within a 12-hour interval. The average treatment effect (ATE) was a measure of 
the therapeutic effect of β-blockers. The primary outcome measure of the study 
was the 90-day survival and hospitalization survival as the secondary endpoint. 
Four machine learning algorithms were employed to assess whether an increase in 
pe-HR enhanced the performance of predictions.
RESULTS: The study included a total of 14,388 patients with S-AKI from MIMIC 
(Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care)-IV. The results revealed that both 
90-day and in-hospital survival were lower in patients with pe-HR than in those 
without (hazard ratio: 1.62 for 90-day survival and 1.22 for in-hospital 
survival). The ATE of development pe-HR was 56.3 days survival higher than 
without pe-HR. The ATE of β-blocker use was 40.2 days survival higher than no 
use. Four machine learning algorithms showed that the inclusion of pe-HR 
improved the accuracy of 90-day survival predictions (p < 0.05), with the best 
area under the receiver operating characteristic curve reaching 0.76.
CONCLUSION: In S-AKI patients, pe-HR was significantly associated with lower 
survival rates. Including pe-HR in prediction models improved their accuracy for 
90-day survival. Our results suggest a causal relationship, highlighting the 
potential therapeutic benefit of β-blockers in managing S-AKI patients.

Long-Term Outcomes in Older Patients with Sepsis in the ICU: A Retrospective 
Study.

Xu C, Lv L, Hu W, Yu Z, Qian H, Chen F.

OBJECTIVE: The primary objectives of this study were to compare the 
characteristics of older and younger patients with sepsis and to analyze risk 
factors associated with 28-day and 90-day mortality in critically ill patients. 
Our study aimed to explore whether there are significant differences between 
sepsis patients in different age groups and whether these differences are 
related to the association between disease severity and mortality.
METHODS: We conducted a single-center, retrospective study of 5783 critically 
ill patients over 18 years of age from the Medical Information Mart for 
Intensive Care III database diagnosed with sepsis and admitted to the intensive 
care unit between 2008 and 2012. We performed a retrospective analysis, selected 
the Critical Care Medicine Information Mart III database, and collected data on 
patients with sepsis. We then collated and analyzed these data to compare 
differences in characteristics between older and younger patients and identify 
associated risk factors, which can help understand patient mortality. This 
approach leverages existing clinical data and avoids new experiments or data 
collection. Kaplan-Meier survival curve was used to assess 28-day and 90-day 
mortality, and a Cox proportional hazards regression model was used to evaluate 
the associated risk factors with 28-day and 90-day mortality.
RESULTS: Our study identified significant differences in mortality between older 
and younger patients with sepsis, finding that older patients had significantly 
higher mortality than younger patients. Furthermore, we successfully identified 
risk factors associated with mortality, results that have important implications 
for optimizing patient care and making clinical decisions. Of 5783 patients with 
sepsis, 2044 (35.3%) were younger than 60 years, and 3739 (64.7%) were aged 60 
years or older. The 28-day mortality rate was 11.8% and 21.2% in the younger and 
older cohorts, respectively (P < .01). In the age-stratified analysis, the 
28-day mortality was the highest in patients aged over 80 years (14.6% vs. 21.2% 
vs. 26.8%, P < .001). Factors associated with 28-day and 90-day mortality in 
patients with sepsis included age, weight, the need for mechanical ventilation, 
congestive heart failure, chronic pulmonary disease, malignancy, and Sequential 
Organ Failure Assessment score. Higher mortality in older patients with sepsis 
suggests the need for more aggressive treatment and monitoring. We also 
identified risk factors associated with mortality, helping to develop 
individualized treatment strategies. In addition, the different clinical 
characteristics of patients in different age groups emphasize the need for 
refined care pathways to meet their special needs. These results will help 
improve the treatment effect and quality of life of patients with sepsis.
CONCLUSIONS: Our study fills the knowledge gap on the manifestations of sepsis 
patients in different age groups and helps medical staff better predict and 
manage disease progression in these two groups and provide personalized 
treatment. This lays the foundation for future in-depth research on age-related 
sepsis factors and is expected to improve patient survival and recovery rates. 
Older patients with sepsis had higher mortality rates and adverse outcomes. The 
mortality rate in patients with sepsis gradually increased with age. The 
importance of these findings is that they can help guide patient care and 
clinical decision-making, particularly when dealing with older and younger 
patients with sepsis, to improve treatment outcomes and reduce mortality. We 
would like to acknowledge that there are several limitations to the study, 
including the selectivity of the database and the retrospective nature, which 
preclude inference of causal relationships. In addition, some unconsidered 
variables may affect the results, and missing information in the data may also 
have an impact on the study. Future research could further explore these 
issues.This study highlights the critical role of age in sepsis patient outcomes 
and provides a strong basis for more sophisticated care and treatment. Our 
findings will help save more lives and improve patients' chances of recovery, 
which has profound implications for future research and clinical practice in the 
field of sepsis.

OBJECTIVE: The relationship between body mass index (BMI) and sepsis prognosis 
remains highly controversial and uncertain. This study investigated the 
association between BMI and prognosis in patients with sepsis.
METHODS: This retrospective observational cohort study included adult patients 
admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) with sepsis from Medical Information 
Mart for Intensive Care-IV version 2.2 (MIMIC-IV V2.2) and eICU Collaborative 
Research Database (eICU-CRD). The cut-off value of BMI was identified by the 
restricted cubic spline (RCS) curve and included patients were categorized into 
two groups: the low BMI group (< 28 kg/m2) and the high BMI group (≥ 28 kg/m2). 
The primary outcome was ICU mortality, and secondary outcomes were in-hospital 
and 28-day mortality. We performed the log-rank test to detect whether there is 
a difference in prognosis among different groups in two different cohorts. 
Multiple distinct models were used to validate the robustness of the results.
RESULTS: There were 18,385 and 38,713 patients in the MIMIC-IV 2.2 and eICU-CRD 
cohorts, respectively. An L-shaped relationship was observed between BMI and ICU 
mortality in the primary analysis from MIMIC-IV 2.2. Similar relationships were 
found in eICU-CRD. When BMI was less than the cut-point, the risk of ICU 
mortality increased rapidly with decreasing BMI. When BMI was greater than the 
cut-point, the risk of ICU mortality levelled off as BMI increased. Sepsis 
patients with higher BMI values exhibited decreased ICU all-cause mortality 
rates (MIMIC-IV cohort: HR: 0.81, 95% CI 0.75-0.88, p < 0.001; eICU-CRD cohort: 
HR: 0.75, 95% CI 0.71-0.80, p < 0.001). Consistent trends were observed for both 
in-hospital mortality and 28-day mortality rates. The results remained robust in 
multiple distinct models and subgroup analyses.
CONCLUSION: An L-shaped relationship was observed between BMI and prognosis in 
septic patients, indicating that lower BMI values are significantly linked to 
increased mortality. Targeted nutritional interventions and close monitoring for 
patients with low BMI could potentially enhance their prognosis. Therefore, BMI 
can also be utilized to categorize the risk levels of patients with sepsis and 
effectively predict their prognosis.

Early Prediction of Sepsis in EMR Records Using Traditional ML Techniques and 
Deep Learning LSTM Networks.

Saqib M, Sha Y, Wang MD.

Sepsis is a life-threatening condition caused by infection and subsequent 
overreaction by the immune system. Physicians effectively treat sepsis with 
early administration of antibiotics. However, excessive use of antibiotics on 
false positive cases cultivates antibiotic resistant bacterial strains and can 
waste resources while false negative cases result in unacceptable mortality 
rates. Accurate early prediction ensures correct, early antibiotic treatment; 
unfortunately, prediction remains daunting due to error-ridden electronic 
medical records (EMRs) and the inherent complexity of sepsis. We aimed to 
predict sepsis using only the first 24 and 36 hours of lab results and vital 
signs for a patient. We used the Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care III 
(MIMIC3) dataset to test machine learning (ML) techniques including traditional 
methods (i.e., random forest (RF) and logistic regression (LR)) as well as deep 
learning techniques (i.e., long short-term memory (LSTM) neural networks). We 
successfully created a data pipeline to process and clean data, identified 
important predictive features using RF and LR techniques, and trained LSTM 
networks. We found that our best performing traditional classifier, RF, had an 
Area Under the Curve (AUC-ROC) score of 0.696, and our LSTM networks did not 
outperform RF.

BACKGROUND: The measurement of Braden score can be used as a useful tool for 
clinical care. However, the relationship between the Braden score and clinical 
outcomes in sepsis patients remains unclear. This study aims to investigate the 
association between the Braden score and clinical outcomes in sepsis patients.
METHODS: The Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care III (MIMIC-III) 
database was searched to identify patients with sepsis who had their Braden 
score measured. The primary outcomes were 28-day, 60-day, and 90-day mortality. 
Multivariate Cox regression analysis was used to clarify the relationship 
between Braden score and primary outcomes, and Kaplan-Meier survival analysis 
and stratified analysis were used to verify our findings.
RESULTS: A total of 8,290 patients were included in our study, during the 
28-day, 60-day, and 90-day follow-up periods, mortality was recorded in 1,554, 
1,938, and 2,173 patients, those with lower Braden score had a 58% increased 
risk of 28-day mortality (hazard ratio [HR] 1.58; 95% confidence interval [CI] 
1.38, 1.81), a 50% increased risk of 60-day mortality(HR 1.50; 95% CI 
1.33,1.70), and a 52% increased risk of 90-day mortality(HR 1.52; 95% CI 
1.35,1.70). Patients with lower Braden score received more mechanical 
ventilation and vasopressors, and presented with elevated WBC counts and lactate 
levels. In addition, lower Braden scores were also linked to increased adjusted 
ICU mortality and a higher incidence of AKI within the first seven days 
following ICU admission.
CONCLUSION: Lower Braden score is an independent risk factor for mortality in 
critically ill patients with sepsis. Braden score can be used as a potential 
indicator for assessing outcomes in such patients.

OBJECTIVES: This study was to evaluate the association between red cell 
distribution width (RDW) and sepsis in acute pancreatitis (AP) patients, and 
assess its predictive value for sepsis in AP patients.
METHODS: This retrospective cohort study collected patients' data from the 
Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care databases. Univariate and 
multivariate Cox models were exploited to compare the mortality within 30 days 
in AP patients with or without sepsis, with hazard ratios (HRs) and 95% 
confidence intervals (CIs) calculated. Univariate and multivariate logistic 
regression analyses were conducted to estimate the association, with odds ratios 
(ORs) and 95%CIs calculated. The predictive value of RDW, white blood cell (WBC) 
sequential organ failure assessment (SOFA), SOFA+RDW, simplified acute 
physiology score II (SAPSII), SAPSII+RDW, bedside index of severity in acute 
pancreatitis (BISAP), BISAP+RDW for sepsis risk in patients with AP were 
evaluated by receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve.
RESULTS: A total of 327 AP patients developed sepsis. The high RDW level was 
linked to a higher sepsis risk in patients with AP, carrying a (95% CI) of 1.10. 
Delong test showed that the area under the curve (AUC) of SOFA+RDW, SAPSII+RDW 
and BISAP+RDW scoring models were significantly greater than those of SOFA, 
SAPSII and BISAP scoring models, respectively (0.822 vs 0.776; 0.708 vs 0.688; 
0.609 vs 0.550, respectively).
CONCLUSION: RDW is not only linked to sepsis risk, but also has a certain 
additive effect on SOFA, SAPSII and BISAP models, among which SOFA+RDW has the 
highest discrimination capacity for sepsis in AP patients.

PURPOSE: This study aimed to compare non-invasive oscillometric blood pressure 
(NIBP) measurement with invasive arterial blood pressure (IBP) measurement in 
patients with sepsis.
METHODS: We conducted a retrospective study to evaluate the agreement between 
IBP and NIBP using the Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care IV (MIMIC-IV) 
database. Paired blood pressure measurements of mean arterial pressure (MAP), 
systolic blood pressure (SBP), and diastolic blood pressure (DBP) were compared 
using Bland-Altman analysis and paired Student's t test. We also focus on the 
effect of norepinephrine (NE) on the agreement between the two methods and the 
association between blood pressure and mortality during intensive care unit 
(ICU) stay.
RESULTS: A total of 96,673 paired blood pressure measurements from 6060 unique 
patients were analyzed in the study. In Bland-Altman analysis, the bias (± SD, 
95% limits of agreement) was 6.21 mmHg (± 12.05 mmHg, - 17.41 to 29.83 mmHg) for 
MAP, 0.39 mmHg (± 19.25 mmHg, - 37.34 to 38.12 mmHg) for SBP, and 0.80 mmHg 
(± 12.92 mmHg, - 24.52 to 26.12 mmHg) for DBP between the two techniques. 
Similarly, large limits of agreement were shown in different groups of NE doses. 
NE doses significantly affected the agreement between IBP and NIBP. SBP between 
the two methods gave an inconsistent assessment of patients' risk of ICU 
mortality.
CONCLUSION: IBP and NIBP were not interchangeable in septic patients. Clinicians 
should be aware that non-invasive MAP was clinically and significantly 
underestimated invasive MAP.

OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to construct interpretable machine learning 
models to predict the risk of developing delirium in patients with sepsis and to 
explore the impact of delirium on the 28-day survival rate of patients.
METHODS: We enrolled 10,321 patients with sepsis older than eighteen years from 
the MIMIC-IV (Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care) database. Sepsis is 
defined as the presence or suspected presence of infection, along with a SOFA 
(Sequential Organ Failure Assessment) score of ≥ 2. Four machine learning 
models, namely XGBoost (extreme gradient Boost), SVM (support vector machine), 
Logistic (logistic regression) and RF (random forest), were established for 
prediction, and the prediction model was constructed.
RESULTS: A total of 10,321 sepsis patients were included, among whom 4,691 
(45.45%) developed delirium. The 28-day mortality rate was markedly elevated in 
the delirium group (log-rank P < 0.001). The XGBoost model has the best 
performance. Finally, 5 variables were selected to draw a nomogram: 
hypertension, SOFA score, chlorine, Hb (hemoglobin), creatinine. The receiver 
operating characteristic (ROC) curve of the predictive delirium model showed 
better predictive efficiency, with an AUC of 0.767 (95%CI (confidence interval): 
0.726-0.798).
CONCLUSION: The nomogram built on the XGBoost model provides clinicians with an 
easy tool to quickly assess the risk of developing delirium in patients with 
sepsis. It provides a new idea and direction for the best model to predict 
delirium in patients with sepsis, so as to promote the development of delirium 
related research.

OBJECTIVE: To explore the optimal pulse oxygen saturation (SpO2) range during 
hospitalization for patients with sepsis.
METHODS: A case-control study design was employed. Demographic information, 
vital signs, comorbidities, laboratory parameters, critical illness scores, 
clinical treatment information, and clinical outcomes of sepsis patients were 
extracted from the Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care- IV (MIMIC- IV). 
A generalized additive model (GAM) combined with a Loess smoothing function was 
employed to analyze and visualize the nonlinear relationship between SpO2 levels 
during hospitalization and in-hospital all-cause mortality. The optimal range of 
SpO2 was determined, and Logistic regression model along with Kaplan-Meier curve 
were utilized to validate the association between the determined range of SpO2 
and in-hospital all-cause mortality.
RESULTS: A total of 5 937 patients met the inclusion criteria, among whom 1 191 
(20.1%) died during hospitalization. GAM analysis revealed a nonlinear and 
U-shaped relationship between SpO2 levels and in-hospital all-cause mortality 
among sepsis patients during hospitalization. Multivariable Logistic regression 
analysis further confirmed that patients with SpO2 levels between 0.96 and 0.98 
during hospitalization had a decreased mortality compared to those with SpO2 < 
0.96 [hypoxia group; odds ratio (OR) = 2.659, 95% confidence interval (95%CI) 
was 2.190-3.229, P < 0.001] and SpO2 > 0.98 (hyperoxia group; OR = 1.594, 95%CI 
was 1.337-1.900, P < 0.001). Kaplan-Meier survival curve showed that patients 
with SpO2 between 0.96 and 0.98 during hospitalization had a higher probability 
of survival than those patient with SpO2 < 0.96 and SpO2 > 0.98 (Log-Rank test: 
χ 2 = 113.400, P < 0.001). Sensitivity analyses demonstrated that, with the 
exception of subgroups with smaller sample sizes, across the strata of age, 
gender, body mass index (BMI), admission type, race, heart rate, systolic blood 
pressure, diastolic blood pressure, mean arterial pressure, respiratory rate, 
body temperature, myocardial infarction, congestive heart failure, 
cerebrovascular disease, chronic liver disease, diabetes mellitus, sequential 
organ failure assessment (SOFA), simplified acute physiology score II (SAPS II), 
systemic inflammatory response syndrome score (SIRS), and Glasgow coma score 
(GCS), the mortality of patients with SpO2 between 0.96 and 0.98 was 
significantly lower than those of patients with SpO2 < 0.96 and SpO2 > 0.98.
CONCLUSIONS: During hospitalization, the level of SpO2 among sepsis patients 
exhibits a U-shaped relationship with in-hospital all-cause mortality, 
indicating that heightened and diminished oxygen levels are both associated with 
increased mortality risk. The optimal SpO2 range is determined to be between 
0.96 and 0.98.

BACKGROUND: To develop an inflammatory biomarker-based, simple-to-use nomogram 
for the early identification of septic patients at high risk of mortality in the 
emergency department (ED).
METHODS: All patients diagnosed with sepsis admitted to the intensive care unit 
(ICU) from the ED were screened from the Medical Information Mart for Intensive 
Care III database and divided into two cohorts: the primary cohort and the 
validation cohort. We used bivariate logistic regression analysis to determine 
independent risk factors and to construct a predictive nomogram and subsequently 
evaluated the calibration, discrimination and clinical usefulness of the 
nomogram. The gradient boosting machine (GBM) model was used to more accurately 
evaluate these variables.
RESULTS: A total of 5663 admissions were enrolled, of which 3964 comprised the 
primary cohort and 1699 comprised the validation group, with 28-day mortality 
rates of 21.2% and 20.4%, respectively. Age > 69, neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio 
(NLR) > 9.8, platelet-to-lymphocyte ratio (PLR) > 249.89, lymphocyte-to-monocyte 
ratio (LMR) ≤ 2.18, and red cell distribution width (RDW) were detected as 
important determinants of 28-day mortality and included in the nomogram. The 
calibration plot revealed an adequate fit of the nomogram for predicting the 
risk of 28-day mortality. Regarding discriminative ability, receiver operating 
characteristic curve analysis showed that the nomogram had an area under the 
curve (AUC) of 0.826 (95% CI: 0.811-0.841, P < 0.001) in the primary cohort, 
which was greater than that of all individual parameters and other scores. 
Decision curve analysis also indicated that our nomogram was feasible in 
clinical practice, as the threshold probabilities were 0-0.62 for the primary 
cohort. The GBM model yielded a significantly greater AUC of up to 0.867.
CONCLUSIONS: This proposed simple-to-use nomogram based on age, NLR, PLR, LMR 
and RDW provides a relatively accurate mortality prediction for septic patients 
in the ED.

BACKGROUND: In critically ill elderly patients, malnutrition is a common 
comorbidity. The Geriatric Nutritional Risk Index (GNRI) is a straightforward 
tool for evaluating the nutritional status of elderly individuals. The 
association between GNRI score and unfavorable health outcomes has been 
established. However, no studies have yet elucidated the relationship between 
GNRI score and sepsis-related acute kidney injury (S-AKI).
METHODS: We sourced patient data from the Medical Information Mart for Intensive 
Care IV (MIMIC-IV) database. All patients were divided into four groups based on 
their GNRI score using quartile analysis. The main objective of this study was 
to investigate the 28-day mortality rate. Secondary study outcomes were the 
incidence of severe AKI, length of stay in the intensive care unit, and days in 
the hospital. To evaluate the association between GNRI score and study outcomes, 
we used a Cox proportional hazards regression model and restricted cubic 
splines. Kaplan-Meier curves were used to compare the outcomes in each group.
RESULTS: A total of 4515 elderly patients with S-AKI were included in this 
study. Patients were categorized into four groups according to GNRI quartile: Q1 
(< 78.92), Q2 (78.92-84.88), Q3 (84.88-90.84), and Q4 (> 90.84). Overall 28-day 
mortality was 29.5%. Patients with a low GNRI were predominantly women, and had 
a low body mass index. After controlling for confounding factors, GNRI score 
emerged as an independent predictor of 28-day mortality among elderly patients 
with S-AKI (Q4 vs. Q1: hazard ratio 0.74, 95% confidence interval 0.63-0.87; 
p < 0.001). Restricted cubic spline analysis revealed a linear relationship 
between GNRI and 28-day mortality (p for non-linearity = 0.207), and this 
association remained consistent across all subgroup analyses.
CONCLUSIONS: The GNRI is an important nutritional assessment tool, and is useful 
in predicting the prognosis of critically ill elderly patients with S- AKI.

BACKGROUND: The optimal timing of enteral nutrition for critically ill septic 
patients in the intensive care unit (ICU) who require invasive mechanical 
ventilation has not been determined, and the influence of early enteral 
nutrition on clinical outcomes is unclear.
METHODS: This retrospective observational study utilized data from the Medical 
Information Mart for Intensive Care IV 2.2 (MIMIC-IV 2.2) database to 
investigate patients with sepsis who needed invasive mechanical ventilation 
post-ICU admission. Patients who had enteral nutrition (EN) initiated within 72 
h of ICU were categorized into the early enteral nutrition (EEN) group, while 
those who began enteral nutrition after 72 h were placed in the delayed enteral 
nutrition (DEN) group. Propensity score matching analysis was performed to 
compare outcomes between these two groups, with the primary outcome being 28-day 
mortality.
RESULTS: The final analysis included 2293 patients, 1546 (67.4%) of whom 
received enteral nutrition within 72 h of invasive mechanical ventilation. The 
overall 28-day mortality rate was 31.0%. After propensity score matching 
employing the proximity matching method, Cox survival analysis revealed that 
early enteral nutrition was associated with increased 28-day mortality in septic 
patients on invasive mechanical ventilation (hazard ratio(HR) 1.440, 95% CI 
1.179-1.760; p < 0.001). The sensitivity and robustness of the evaluation 
results under different models, including optimal matching (adjusted odds ratio 
(aOR) 1.52, 95% CI 1.21-1.92, p < 0.001), inverse probability of treatment 
weighting (aOR 1.27, 95% CI 1.02-1.58, p = 0.034), and logistic regression 
analysis (aOR 1.48, 95% CI 1.18-1.84, p = 0.001), confirmed the association 
between early enteral nutrition and increased 28-day mortality in mechanically 
ventilated septic patients.
CONCLUSIONS: Compared to delayed enteral nutrition, early enteral nutrition is 
associated with higher 28-day mortality in septic patients on invasive 
mechanical ventilation. Randomized controlled trials are warranted to validate 
these findings.

Sepsis related acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) is a common and 
serious disease in clinic. Accurate prediction of in-hospital mortality of 
patients is crucial to optimize treatment and improve prognosis under the new 
global definition of ARDS. Our study aimed to use machine learning models to 
develop models that can effectively predict the in-hospital mortality of 
patients with sepsis related ARDS, calculate the mortality, and to identify 
related risk factors under the new global definition of ARDS. Based on MIMIC 
database, our study included 3470 first-time admission records of patients with 
sepsis related ARDS. After excluding 4 patients under the age of 18, 75 patients 
with less than 24 h stay in ICU, and 5 cases with missing indicators > 30%, 
finally 3386 cases were retained. The variance inflation factor (VIF) analysis 
was used to test the collinearity of the explanatory variables. The data were 
divided into the training set and the test set according to the ratio of 7:3. 
Six models, extreme gradient boosting (XGBoost), light gradient boosting 
(LightGBM), random forest (RF), classification and regression tree (CART), naive 
bayes (NB) and logistic regression (LR), were designed for training and testing. 
In the training set, XGBoost (AUROC = 0.951, 95% CI 0.942-0.961), LR 
(AUROC = 0.835, 95% CI 0.817-0.854), RF (AUROC = 1.0, 95% CI 1.0-1.0), LightGBM 
(AUROC = 1.0, 95% CI 1.0-1.0), CART (AUROC = 0.831, 95% CI 0.811-0.852), NB 
(AUROC = 0.793, 95% CI 0.772-0.814). In the test set, XGBoost (AUROC = 0.833, 
95% CI 0.804-0.861), LR (AUROC = 0.82695% CI 0.796-0.856), RF (AUROC = 0.846, 
95% CI 0.818-0.874), LightGBM (AUROC = 0.827, 95% CI 0.798-0.856), CART 
(AUROC = 0.753, 95% CI 0.718-0.787), NB (AUROC = 0.799, 95% CI 0.768-0.831). The 
RF model has the best performance on the test set. Further analyze the feature 
importance ranking and partial dependence plots of random forest model. Acute 
physiology and chronic health evaluation III (APACHE III), bicarbonate, anion 
gap and non-invasive blood pressure systolic were identified as the four most 
important risk characteristics. In this study, a variety of machine learning 
models have been successfully constructed to predict the in-hospital mortality 
of patients with sepsis related ARDS, among which the RF model performs well. 
Key risk factors identified include APACHE III, bicarbonate, anion gap and 
non-invasive blood pressure systolic. The identification of these factors helps 
clinicians to assess patients' conditions more accurately and develop 
personalized treatment plans, thereby improving the survival rate and prognosis 
quality of patients under the new global definition of ARDS.

University, Beijing, China.

BACKGROUND: Sepsis-associated liver injury (SALI) is a critical component of 
sepsis-induced multiple organ dysfunction with high mortality. Identifying 
biomarkers for risk stratification is essential. Red cell distribution width 
(RDW), indicating variation in red blood cell volume, has been linked to adverse 
outcomes in various diseases. This study aimed to evaluate the association 
between RDW and 30-day mortality in SALI patients.
METHODS: A retrospective cohort study was conducted using data from the Medical 
Information Mart for Intensive Care-IV database. Patients admitted to the 
intensive care unit (ICU) with SALI were included. RDW was recorded within the 
initial 24 h. The primary outcome was 30-day mortality. A multivariable Cox 
regression analysis was performed to examine the relationship between RDW and 
mortality.
RESULTS: Among 529 SALI patients (mean age 68.7 years, 61.8% male), 46.1% had 
RDW > 15.5%. The 30-day mortality rate was 35.5%. RDW was significantly higher 
in non-survivors compared to survivors (17.2 ± 3.0 vs. 15.4 ± 2.3, P < 0.001). 
Cox regression identified RDW as an independent risk factor for 30-day mortality 
(HR 1.14, 95% CI 1.09 to 1.19, P < 0.001). Subgroup analyses demonstrated that 
the findings were consistent across the various groups.
CONCLUSION: Elevated RDW is independently associated with higher 30-day 
mortality in patients with SALI, suggesting its potential role in risk 
stratification and clinical management.

Background: Dexmedetomidine is recommended for sedation in patients on 
mechanical ventilation. Whether age or ICU types could alter mortality in 
invasive mechanically ventilated patients with sepsis receiving dexmedetomidine 
is unknown. Methods: We included patients with sepsis receiving invasive 
mechanical ventilation from the Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care IV 
database. The exposure was intravenous dexmedetomidine administration during ICU 
stay. The primary outcome was 28-day mortality. The secondary outcomes were the 
length of ICU stay and liberation from invasive mechanical ventilation. 
Propensity score matching (PSM) and Cox proportional hazards regression were 
used to adjust for confounders and investigate any association. Restricted cubic 
spline models were used to evaluate potential nonlinear associations. Results: 
The pre-matched and propensity score-matched cohorts included 5,871 and 2016 
patients, respectively. In the PSM cohorts, dexmedetomidine exposure was related 
to lower 28-day mortality (186 [17.7%] vs. 319 [30.3%]; p < 0.001). Patients 
receiving dexmedetomidine, regardless of whether they were younger (≤65 years; 
hazard ratio [HR], 0.31; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.23-0.42; p < 0.001) or 
elderly (>65 years; HR, 0.65; 95% CI, 0.52-0.83; p < 0.001), was associated with 
lower 28-day mortality (61 [10.3%] vs. 168 [28.2%] for younger; 125 [27.2%] vs. 
152 [33.0%] for elderly). Patients receiving dexmedetomidine was also associated 
with lower 28-day mortality (53 [12.6%] vs. 113 [26.5%] for surgical intensive 
care unit [SICU]; 133 [21.0%] vs. 206 [32.9%] for non-SICU) regardless of 
whether the first admission to the SICU (HR, 0.36; 95% CI, 0.25-0.50; p < 0.001) 
or non-SICU (HR, 0.50; 95% CI, 0.40-0.62; p < 0.001). Moreover, both dose and 
duration of dexmedetomidine administration were related to lower 28-day 
mortality than no dexmedetomidine in younger patients (p < 0.001), but it not 
statistically significant in elderly patients. Conclusion: Dexmedetomidine was 
associated with lower 28-day mortality in critically ill patients with sepsis 
receiving invasive mechanical ventilation, regardless of whether patients were 
younger or elderly, the first admission to the SICU or non-SICU.

OBJECTIVES: This study investigates serum markers for short-term prognosis in 
hepatic encephalopathy patients.
BACKGROUND: Patients with hepatic encephalopathy face elevated mortality rates 
and bleak prognoses. However, effective prognostic models or indicators are 
lacking. This study aims to explore serum markers for predicting short-term 
prognosis in these patients.
METHODS: We conducted a retrospective analysis of 552 patients with hepatic 
encephalopathy, categorizing 429 individuals meeting exclusion criteria into 
normal and high activated partial thromboplastin time (APTT) groups. We assessed 
12-day and 25-day survival rates using Kaplan-Meier analysis and Cox regression 
models to examine associations between groups and outcomes.
RESULTS: Upon comparing baseline characteristics, the high APTT group exhibited 
significant disparities in acute kidney injury, sepsis, coagulation disorders, 
and ascites (p < 0.05). In the multivariate COX regression model, the hazard 
ratios [HRs; 95% confidence interval (CI)] of 12- and 25-day mortality were 
1.012 (1.001, 1.022, p = 0.033) and 1.010 (1.002, 1.018, p = 0.013), 
respectively. We discovered that APTT demonstrated an independent association 
with prognosis. Our findings revealed that the ability of APTT to predict 
short-term prognosis surpasses that of the traditional MELD model. Regarding 12- 
and 25-day survival, Kaplan-Meier survival curves from these groups demonstrated 
a lower survival probability for patients in the high APTT group than the normal 
group (log-rank p < 0.05). The results of subgroup analysis and interaction 
analysis indicate that APTT is not influenced by other confounding factors.
CONCLUSION: A prolonged APTT suggests a poorer short-term prognosis in patients 
with hepatic encephalopathy.

Aiming at the problem that the small samples of critical disease in clinic may 
lead to prognostic models with poor performance of overfitting, large prediction 
error and instability, the long short-term memory transferring algorithm 
(transLSTM) was proposed. Based on the idea of transfer learning, the algorithm 
leverages the correlation between diseases to transfer information of different 
disease prognostic models, constructs the effictive model of target disease of 
small samples with the aid of large data of related diseases, hence improves the 
prediction performance and reduces the requirement for target training sample 
quantity. The transLSTM algorithm firstly uses the related disease samples to 
pretrain partial model parameters, and then further adjusts the whole network 
with the target training samples. The testing results on MIMIC-Ⅲ database showed 
that compared with traditional LSTM classification algorithm, the transLSTM 
algorithm had 0.02-0.07 higher AUROC and 0.05-0.14 larger AUPRC, while its 
number of training iterations was only 39%-64% of the traditional algorithm. The 
results of application on sepsis revealed that the transLSTM model of only 100 
training samples had comparable mortality prediction performance to the 
traditional model of 250 training samples. In small sample situations, the 
transLSTM algorithm has significant advantages with higher prediciton accuracy 
and faster training speed. It realizes the application of transfer learning in 
the prognostic model of critical disease with small samples.

BACKGROUND: Sepsis is a life-threatening condition frequently observed in 
patients with intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH) who are critically ill. Early and 
accurate identification and prediction of sepsis are crucial. Machine learning 
(ML)-based predictive models exhibit promising sepsis prediction capabilities in 
emergency settings. However, their application in predicting sepsis among 
patients with ICH is still limited.
OBJECTIVE: The aim of the study is to develop an ML-driven risk calculator for 
early prediction of sepsis in patients with ICH who are critically ill and to 
clarify feature importance and explain the model using the Shapley Additive 
Explanations method.
METHODS: Patients with ICH admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) from the 
Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care IV database between 2008 and 2022 
were divided into training and internal test sets. The external test was 
performed using the eICU Collaborative Research Database, which includes over 
200,000 ICU admissions across the United States between 2014 and 2015. Sepsis 
following ICU admission was identified using Sepsis-3.0 through clinical 
diagnosis combining elevation of the Sequential Organ Failure Assessment by ≥2 
points with suspected infection. The Boruta algorithm was used for feature 
selection, confirming 29 features. Nine ML algorithms were used to construct the 
prediction models. Predictive performance was compared using several evaluation 
metrics, including the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve 
(AUC). The Shapley Additive Explanations technique was used to interpret the 
final model, and a web-based risk calculator was constructed for clinical 
practice.
RESULTS: Overall, 2414 patients with ICH were enrolled from the Medical 
Information Mart for Intensive Care IV database, with 1689 and 725 patients 
assigned to the training and internal test sets, respectively. An external test 
set of 2806 patients with ICH from the eICU database was used. Among the 9 ML 
models tested, the categorical boosting (CatBoost) model demonstrated the best 
discriminative ability. After reducing features based on their importance, an 
explainable final CatBoost model was developed using 8 features. The final model 
accurately predicted sepsis in internal (AUC=0.812) and external (AUC=0.771) 
tests.
CONCLUSIONS: We constructed a web-based risk calculator with 8 features based on 
the CatBoost model to assist clinicians in identifying people at high risk for 
sepsis in patients with ICH who are critically ill.

Sepsis is well known with high mortality, and there is a need for early 
recognition of septic patients with poor prognosis. The purpose of this study is 
to evaluate the association between lactate dehydrogenase to albumin ratio (LAR) 
and the short-term mortality in sepsis. Septic patients were selected from 
Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care IV database. The primary and 
secondary outcomes were 28-day and 90-day all-cause mortality. Cox regression 
analysis, Kaplan-Meier survival curves, restricted cubic spline and subgroup and 
sensitivity analyses were performed to explore the relationship between LAR and 
mortality. The study included 5784 patients with sepsis. Kaplan-Meier analysis 
showed that patients with higher LAR exhibited lower 28-day and 90-day survival 
rates. There existed a linear relationship between log2 transformed LAR and 
28-day and 90-day mortality. Multivariable Cox regression analysis revealed a 
positive relationship between log2-LAR and 28-day mortality risk (HR, 1.36; 95% 
CI, 1.29-1.42; P < .001). Patients in the second and third tertile groups had 
higher risk for 28-day mortality (HR = 1.46, 95% CI = 1.26-1.70, and HR = 2.14, 
95% CI = 1.85-2.49, respectively; P for trend < .001), compared to first tertile 
group. Similar results were found for 90-day mortality. Subgroup and sensitivity 
analyses revealed consistent results. High LAR was independently associated with 
an increased risk of 28-day and 90-day all-cause mortality in patients with 
sepsis. LAR was suggested to be a promising biomarker for early identification 
of septic patients at higher risk of short-term mortality.

BACKGROUND: The use, timing, and dosage of morphine in septic patients with a 
history of Chronic Heart Failure (CHF) are poorly studied, and it is still 
unclear if morphine administration affects sepsis survival. This study aims to 
elucidate the relationship between early morphine administration and 30-day 
mortality among septic patients with a history of CHF.
METHODS: Utilizing data from the Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care IV 
(MIMIC-IV) database, this retrospective cohort study focuses on septic patients 
with CHF. The authors investigated the effects of early morphine administration 
(within 24 h of ICU admission) on 30-day mortality, employing Cox proportional 
hazards modeling and Propensity Score Matching (PSM) for analysis.
RESULTS: The authors analyzed 7424 adult septic patients with CHF, among whom 
6495 received early morphine and 929 were managed without morphine. The early 
morphine group exhibited a significantly lower 30-day mortality rate compared to 
the nonmorphine group (post-matched 16.4 % vs. 25.7 %, Absolute Risk Reduction 
(ARR) 9.3 % (95 % Confidence Interval [95 % CI 5.1-13.6], p < 0.001). Among 
septic patients with CHF, early morphine administration was associated with a 
reduction in 30-day death in all adjusted variables (HR = 0.539‒0.735, p < 
0.001). After PSM, only <15 mg of morphine was correlated to a lower 30-day 
mortality rate (HR = 0.233, 95 % CI 0.086-0.632, p < 0.001).
CONCLUSION: This investigation reveals a significant association between the 
early administration of morphine and reduced risk-adjusted 30-day mortality in 
septic patients with CHF.

BACKGROUND: Multiple organ dysfunction syndrome (MODS) is a critical 
complication in trauma-induced sepsis patients and is associated with a high 
mortality rate. This study aimed to develop and validate predictive models for 
MODS in this patient population using a nomogram and machine learning 
approaches.
METHODS: This retrospective cohort study utilized data from the Medical 
Information Mart for Intensive Care-IV 2.2 database, focusing on trauma patients 
diagnosed with sepsis within the first day of intensive care unit (ICU) 
admission. Predictive variables were extracted from the initial 24 h of ICU 
data. The dataset (2008-2019) was divided into a training set (2008-2016) and a 
temporal validation set (2017-2019). Feature selection was conducted using the 
Boruta algorithm. Predictive models were developed and validated using a 
nomogram and various machine learning techniques. Model performance was 
evaluated based on discrimination, calibration, and decision curve analysis.
RESULTS: Among 1295 trauma patients with sepsis, 349 (26.95%) developed MODS. 
The 28-day mortality rates were 11.21% for non-MODS patients and 23.82% for MODS 
patients. Key predictors of MODS included the simplified acute physiology score 
II score, use of mechanical ventilation, and vasopressor administration. In 
temporal validation, all models significantly outperformed traditional scoring 
systems (all P <0.05). The nomogram achieved an area under the curve (AUC) of 
0.757 (95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.700 to 0.814), while the random forest 
model demonstrated the highest performance with an AUC of 0.769 (95% CI: 0.712 
to 0.826). Calibration plots showed excellent agreement between predicted and 
observed probabilities, and decision curve analysis indicated a consistently 
higher net benefit for the newly developed models.
CONCLUSION: The nomogram and machine learning models provide enhanced predictive 
accuracy for MODS in trauma-induced sepsis patients compared to traditional 
scoring systems. These tools, accessible via web-based applications, have the 
potential to improve early risk stratification and guide clinical 
decision-making, ultimately enhancing outcomes for trauma patients. Further 
external validation is recommended to confirm their generalizability.

Objective: The quick sequential organ failure assessment (qSOFA) score has been 
proposed as part of diagnostic criteria for sepsis, but there might be an 
underestimation of the incidence of qSOFA-negative sepsis according to a few 
recent studies. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the value of Oxford 
acute severity of illness score (OASIS) in identifying qSOFA-negative (qSOFA<2) 
patients with sepsis. Methods: Sepsis patients with negative qSOFA scores were 
selected from the Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care Ⅲ(MIMIC-Ⅲ), a 
database comprising de-identified health-related data from patients staying in 
the critical care units of Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center between 2001 and 
2012. Non-infectious patients with both qSOFA and SOFA scores less than 2 were 
enrolled as controls. Propensity score matching (PSM) analysis was used to 
reduce the effects of selection bias. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) 
curve analysis was performed to assess the value of OASIS in discriminating 
qSOFA-negative patients with sepsis and to determine its optimal cut-off. 
Associations of OASIS with 28-day mortality after intensive care unit (ICU) 
admission, ICU mortality, and hospital mortality were further examined using 
multivariate Cox regression and multivariate logistic regression analysis. 
Results: 2 273 qSOFA-negative patients with sepsis and 3 342 non-sepsis controls 
were included finally with a PSM cohort consisted of 1 677 sepsis patients and 1 
677 controls. Results of ROC analysis showed that the area under ROC curve was 
0.753 [95% confidence interval (CI) 0.741-0.765] and the optimal OASIS threshold 
according to the Youden index was 26.5 and yielded a 67.2% sensitivity and 70.8% 
specificity. Multivariate regression analysis indicated that OASIS>26 was an 
independent risk factor for 28-day mortality (hazard ratio 2.80, 95% CI 
2.15-3.65, P<0.01), ICU mortality (odds ratio 4.69, 95% CI 2.60-8.49, P<0.01), 
and hospital mortality (odds ratio 4.48, 95% CI 3.13-6.42, P<0.01). Analysis of 
the PSM cohort presented consistent results. Conclusions: OASIS had a good 
discriminative value to differentiate qSOFA-negative patients with sepsis from 
those without sepsis.

方法：从存储了美国贝斯以色列迪康医学中心重症监护室2001年至2012年住院患者医疗信息的监护室医学信息数据集(MIMIC-Ⅲ)中选取qSOFA阴性的脓毒症患者，同时筛选qSOFA<2、无可疑感染且SOFA<2的其他患者作为对照，并构建倾向性评分匹配队列以减少选择偏倚，运用ROC曲线分析OASIS鉴别qSOFA阴性脓毒症患者的价值并确定其阈值，进一步运用多因素Cox回归、logistic回归分析基于该阈值的OASIS水平与研究对象临床结局的关联。 
结果： 2 273例qSOFA阴性脓毒症患者与3 342例作为对照的非脓毒症患者纳入最终分析，其中1 
677对患者成功匹配。受试者工作特征曲线(ROC曲线)分析结果显示，OASIS鉴别qSOFA阴性脓毒症患者的曲线下面积为0.753(95%CI为0.741～0.765)，Youden指数法确定的阈值为26.5，相应的敏感度为67.2%，特异度为70.8%。多因素回归分析显示，OASIS>26分别是患者28 
d死亡(风险比为2.80，95%CI为2.15～3.65，P<0.01)、ICU内死亡(比值比为4.69，95%CI为2.60～8.49，P<0.01)以及院内死亡(比值比为4.48，95%CI为3.13～6.42，P<0.01)的独立危险因素。对匹配队列的分析结果亦类似。 
结论： OASIS对qSOFA阴性脓毒症患者具有较高的鉴别能力。.

BACKGROUND: Stress hyperglycemia ratio (SHR), which adjusts blood glucose levels 
using glycated hemoglobin to eliminate the influence of chronic hyperglycemia, 
has been demonstrated to have superior predictive value than absolute 
hyperglycemia. However, its predictive value for sepsis-associated acute kidney 
injury (SA-AKI) remains unclear. This study aimed to investigate the 
relationship between the SHR and the risk of developing SA-AKI.
METHODS: Data were extracted from the Medical Information Mart for Intensive 
Care IV (MIMIC-IV) database. Restricted cubic splines (RCS) were employed to 
depict the relationship between SHR and the likelihood of SA-AKI, determining an 
optimal cut-off value. Based on this threshold, patients were categorized into 
two groups. Logistic regression was utilized to evaluate SHR's predictive value 
for SA-AKI, with adjustments for confounding variables. Propensity score 
matching (PSM) was applied to balance baseline characteristics. Subgroup and 
sensitivity analyses were conducted.
RESULTS: A total of 2,249 patients were included. The RCS curve indicated a 
non-linear positive association between SHR and the likelihood of SA-AKI (P for 
non-linearity < 0.001), with an optimal cut-off at 1.55. Accordingly, patients 
were divided into SHR ≤ 1.55 and SHR > 1.55 subgroups, comprising 1,131 and 
1,118 individuals, respectively. A higher incidence of SA-AKI was observed in 
the SHR > 1.55 group (38.64% vs. 27.23%, P < 0.001). This association persisted 
after baseline adjustment through PSM. Logistic regression analysis confirmed 
that SHR > 1.55 was linked to increased odds of SA-AKI in both unadjusted (OR: 
1.68, P < 0.001) and adjusted models (OR: 1.73, P < 0.001), with SHR ≤ 1.55 
serving as the reference. In subgroup analysis, all subgroups consistently 
demonstrated a significant association between SHR > 1.55 and elevated odds of 
SA-AKI (all OR > 1). Sensitivity analysis validated that SHR > 1.55 remained 
significantly correlated with SA-AKI occurrence in the survival subgroup (OR: 
1.46, P < 0.001) and the non-CKD subgroup (OR: 1.69, P < 0.001).
CONCLUSION: The findings indicate a non-linear positive relationship between SHR 
and the likelihood of SA-AKI in patients with sepsis, suggesting that SHR could 
be a potential predictor for SA-AKI.

BACKGROUND: Hypoalbuminemia in septic patients is a known prognostic factor for 
poor outcomes, yet the optimal therapeutic interventions remain unclear. This 
study aimed to evaluate the effect of the co-administration of albumin and loop 
diuretics on in-hospital mortality among septic patients with hypoalbuminemia.
METHODS: This retrospective cohort study utilized data from the Medical 
Information Mart for Intensive Care IV (MIMIC-IV) database, analyzing 3,373 
adult septic patients diagnosed with hypoalbuminemia. To control for potential 
confounding factors, Cox proportional hazard models and propensity score 
matching (PSM) were employed. The primary outcome was in-hospital mortality, and 
secondary outcomes included the effects of different dosages of loop diuretics.
RESULTS: The results demonstrated that septic patients with hypoalbuminemia who 
received a combination of albumin and loop diuretics had a significantly lower 
in-hospital mortality rate compared to those treated with albumin alone (25.5% 
vs. 36.5%, p < 0.001). The timing of diuretic administration, specifically after 
albumin infusion, was linked to further reductions in mortality. Notably, the 
administration of furosemide at dosages between 10mg and 40mg per day was 
associated with the lowest mortality rates.
CONCLUSION: In septic patients with hypoalbuminemia, co-administration of 
albumin and loop diuretics is associated with a substantial reduction in 
in-hospital mortality, especially when loop diuretics are administered following 
albumin infusion. These findings suggest a potential treatment strategy that 
merits validation through future prospective randomized controlled trials.

University, Dongyang, Zhejiang, 322100, People's Republic of China.

PURPOSE: Studies on the prognosis of critically ill older adult patients 
admitted to the emergency department (ED) but requiring immediate admission to 
the intensive care unit (ICU) remain limited. This study aimed to develop an 
in-hospital mortality prediction model for critically ill older adult patients 
transferred from the ED to the ICU.
PATIENTS AND METHODS: The training cohort was taken from the Medical Information 
Mart for Intensive Care IV (version 2.2) database, and the external validation 
cohort was taken from the Affiliated Dongyang Hospital of Wenzhou Medical 
University. In the training cohort, class balance was addressed using Random 
Over Sampling Examples (ROSE). Univariate and multivariate Cox regression 
analyses were performed to identify independent risk factors. These were then 
integrated into the predictive nomogram. In the validation cohort, the 
predictive performance of the nomogram was evaluated using the area under the 
curve (AUC) of the receiver operating characteristic curve, calibration curve, 
clinical utility decision curve analysis (DCA), and clinical impact curve (CIC).
RESULTS: In the ROSE-balanced training cohort, univariate and multivariate Cox 
regression analysis identified that age, sex, Glasgow coma scale score, 
malignant cancer, sepsis, use of mechanical ventilation, use of vasoactive 
agents, white blood cells, potassium, and creatinine were independent predictors 
of in-hospital mortality in critically ill older adult patients, and were 
included in the nomogram. The nomogram showed good predictive performance in the 
ROSE-balanced training cohort (AUC [95% confidence interval]: 0.792 
[0.783-0.801]) and validation cohort (AUC [95% confidence interval]: 0.780 
[0.727-0.834]). The calibration curves were well-fitted. DCA and CIC 
demonstrated that the nomogram has good clinical application value.
CONCLUSION: This study developed a predictive model for early prediction of 
in-hospital mortality in critically ill older adult patients transferred from 
the ED to the ICU, which was validated by external data and has good predictive 
performance.

BACKGROUND: Recent research has revealed the potential value of machine learning 
(ML) models in improving prognostic prediction for patients with trauma. ML can 
enhance predictions and identify which factors contribute the most to 
posttraumatic mortality. However, no studies have explored the risk factors, 
complications, and risk prediction of preoperative and postoperative traumatic 
coagulopathy (PPTIC) in patients with trauma.
OBJECTIVE: This study aims to help clinicians implement timely and appropriate 
interventions to reduce the incidence of PPTIC and related complications, 
thereby lowering in-hospital mortality and disability rates for patients with 
trauma.
METHODS: We analyzed data from 13,235 patients with trauma from 4 medical 
centers, including medical histories, laboratory results, and hospitalization 
complications. We developed 10 ML models in Python (Python Software Foundation) 
to predict PPTIC based on preoperative indicators. Data from 10,023 Medical 
Information Mart for Intensive Care patients were divided into training (70%) 
and test (30%) sets, with 3212 patients from 3 other centers used for external 
validation. Model performance was assessed with 5-fold cross-validation, 
bootstrapping, Brier score, and Shapley additive explanation values.
RESULTS: Univariate logistic regression identified PPTIC risk factors as (1) 
prolonged activated partial thromboplastin time, prothrombin time, and 
international normalized ratio; (2) decreased levels of hemoglobin, hematocrit, 
red blood cells, calcium, and sodium; (3) lower admission diastolic blood 
pressure; (4) elevated alanine aminotransferase and aspartate aminotransferase 
levels; (5) admission heart rate; and (6) emergency surgery and perioperative 
transfusion. Multivariate logistic regression revealed that patients with PPTIC 
faced significantly higher risks of sepsis (1.75-fold), heart failure 
(1.5-fold), delirium (3.08-fold), abnormal coagulation (3.57-fold), tracheostomy 
(2.76-fold), mortality (2.19-fold), and urinary tract infection (1.95-fold), 
along with longer hospital and intensive care unit stays. Random forest was the 
most effective ML model for predicting PPTIC, achieving an area under the 
receiver operating characteristic of 0.91, an area under the 
precision-recall curve of 0.89, accuracy of 0.84, sensitivity of 0.80, 
specificity of 0.88, precision of 0.88, F1-score of 0.84, and Brier score of 
0.13 in external validation.
CONCLUSIONS: Key PPTIC risk factors include (1) prolonged activated partial 
thromboplastin time, prothrombin time, and international normalized ratio; (2) 
low levels of hemoglobin, hematocrit, red blood cells, calcium, and sodium; (3) 
low diastolic blood pressure; (4) elevated alanine aminotransferase and 
aspartate aminotransferase levels; (5) admission heart rate; and (6) the need 
for emergency surgery and transfusion. PPTIC is associated with severe 
complications and extended hospital stays. Among the ML models, the random 
forest model was the most effective predictor.

OBJECTIVE: To investigate the association between furosemide administration and 
clinical outcomes in patients with sepsis-associated acute kidney injury (SAKI) 
receiving renal replacement therapy (RRT).
DESIGN: A retrospective observational cohort study.
SETTING: The data were collected from the Medical Information Mart for Intensive 
Care IV (MIMIC-IV) database, which contains clinical data from more than 380 000 
patients admitted to the intensive care units (ICUs) of the Beth Israel 
Deaconess Medical Center from 2008 to 2019.
PARTICIPANTS: All adult patients with SAKI receiving RRT were enrolled. Data for 
each patient within the first 24 hours of ICU admission were extracted from the 
MIMIC-IV database.
PRIMARY AND SECONDARY OUTCOME MEASURES: The primary outcome was in-hospital 
mortality, and the secondary outcome was the length of hospital stay, length of 
ICU stay, RRT-free time and ventilator-free time. Logistic regression was used 
to investigate the association between furosemide administration and in-hospital 
mortality. Subgroup analysis was employed to explore the potential sources of 
heterogeneity.
RESULTS: A total of 1663 patients with SAKI receiving RRT were enrolled in the 
study, of whom 991 patients (59.6%) were retrospectively allocated to the 
Furosemide group and 672 (40.4%) patients to the non-furosemide group. 
Univariate and multivariate logistic regression showed that furosemide 
administration was associated with reduced in-hospital mortality, respectively 
((OR 0.77; 95% CI 0.63 to 0.93; p=0.008 < 0.05), (OR 0.59; 95% CI 0.46 to 0.75; 
p<0.001)). The association remained robust to different ways of adjusting for 
baseline confounding (all p<0.05). Subgroup analysis suggested that AKI-stage 
may be a source of heterogeneity. Patients in the furosemide group also had 
longer RRT-free time (p<0.001) and longer ventilator-free time (p<0.001) than 
those in the non-furosemide group.
CONCLUSIONS: Furosemide is associated with decreased in-hospital mortality, 
longer RRT-free time and ventilator-free time in patients with SAKI receiving 
RRT.

BACKGROUND: Sepsis-induced myocardial injury (SIMI) is a severe and common 
complication of sepsis; However, its definition remains unclear. Prognostic 
analyses may vary depending on the definition applied. Early prediction of SIMI 
is crucial for timely intervention, ultimately improving patient outcomes. This 
study aimed to evaluate the prognostic impact of SIMI and develop validated 
predictive models using advanced machine learning (ML) algorithms for 
identifying SIMI in critically ill sepsis patients.
METHODS: Data were sourced from the Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care 
IV (MIMIC-IV, v3.0) database. Patients meeting Sepsis-3.0 criteria were 
included, and SIMI was defined as troponin T (TNT) levels ≥0.1 ng/mL. Prognostic 
evaluation involved propensity score matching, inverse probability weighting, 
doubly robust analysis, logistic regression, and Cox regression. Patients were 
divided into training and testing datasets in a 7:3 ratio. Least absolute 
shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) regression was used for variable 
selection to simplify the model. Twelve hyperparameter-tuned ML models were 
developed and evaluated using visualized heatmaps. The best-performing model was 
deployed as a web-based application.
RESULTS: Among 2,435 patients analyzed, 571 (23.45%) developed SIMI following 
intensive care unit (ICU) admission. Boruta and LASSO identified 46 and 10 key 
variables, respectively, for prognostic and predictive modeling. Doubly robust 
analysis revealed significantly worse short- and intermediate-term outcomes for 
SIMI patients, including increased in-ICU mortality [odds ratio (OR) 1.39, 95% 
confidence interval (CI) 1.02-1.85, p < 0.05], 28-day mortality (OR 1.35, 95% CI 
1.02-1.79, p < 0.05), and 180-day mortality [hazard ratio (HR) 1.21, 95% CI 
1.01-1.44, p < 0.05]. However, one-year mortality showed no significant 
difference (HR 1.03, 95% CI 0.99-1.08, p = 0.169). The XGBoost model 
outperformed others, achieving an area under the receiver operating 
characteristic curve (AUROC) of 0.83 (95% CI 0.79-0.87). SHapley Additive 
exPlanations (SHAP) analysis highlighted the top five predictive features: 
creatine kinase-myocardial band (CKMB), creatinine, alanine aminotransferase 
(ALT), lactate, and blood urea nitrogen (BUN). A web-based application was 
subsequently developed for real-world use.
CONCLUSION: SIMI significantly worsens patient prognosis, while the XGBoost 
model demonstrated excellent predictive performance. The development of a 
web-based application provides clinicians with a practical tool for timely 
intervention, potentially improving outcomes for septic patients.

Routine blood examination is an easy way to examine infectious diseases. This 
study is aimed to develop a model to diagnose serious bacterial infections (SBI) 
in ICU neonates based on routine blood parameters. This was a cross-sectional 
study, and data were extracted from the Medical Information Mart for Intensive 
Care III (MIMIC-III). SBI was defined as suffering from one of the following: 
pyelonephritis, bacteraemia, bacterial meningitis, sepsis, pneumonia, 
cellulitis, and osteomyelitis. Variables with statistical significance in the 
univariate logistic regression analysis and log systemic immune-inflammatory 
index (SII) were used to develop the model. The area under the curve (AUC) was 
calculated to assess the performance of the model. A total of 1,880 participants 
were finally included for analysis. Weight, haemoglobin, mean corpuscular 
volume, white blood cell, monocyte, premature delivery, and log SII were 
selected to develop the model. The developed model showed a good performance to 
diagnose SBI for ICU neonates, with an AUC of 0.812 (95% confidence interval 
(CI): 0.737-0.888). A nomogram was developed to make this model visualise. In 
conclusion, our model based on routine blood parameters performed well in the 
diagnosis of neonatal SBI, which may be helpful for clinicians to improve 
treatment recommendations.

OBJECTIVE: We aimed to investigate the association between serum phosphate 
levels and the risk for developing sepsis associated acute kidney injury (SAKI).
METHODS: Septic patients from the Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care IV 
(MIMIC IV) and the eICU Collaborative Research Database (eICU-CRD) were 
enrolled. Restricted cubic spline (RCS) was used to visualize the relationship 
between phosphate levels and the risk of SAKI. Patients were divided into four 
categories based on their serum phosphate levels. Logistic regression analysis, 
receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve and subgroup analysis were 
performed to evaluate the predictive value of serum phosphate for SAKI.
RESULTS: A total of 9,244 and 2,124 patients from the MIMIC IV and eICU-CRD 
database were included in the final analysis. RCS curve revealed a non-linear 
correlation between phosphate levels and the risk of SAKI (p for non-linearity 
<0.05). Each 1 mg/dL increase in phosphate levels was associated with a 1.51 to 
1.64-fold increased risk of SAKI (OR 2.51-2.64, p < 0.001) in the MIMIC IV 
cohort and a 0.29 to 0.38-fold increased risk (OR 1.29-1.38, p < 0.001) in the 
eICU-CRD cohort. Compared to the normal-low category, hyperphosphatemia and 
normal-high category were independently associated with an increased risk of 
SAKI, while hypophosphatemia was independently associated with a decreased risk 
in the MIMIC IV cohort. A similar trend was observed in the eICU-CRD cohort, but 
statistical significance disappeared in the hypophosphatemia category and the 
adjusted model of normal high category. These finding was consistent in subgroup 
analysis.
CONCLUSION: Elevated serum phosphate, even within the normal range, is an 
independent risk factor for developing SAKI in septic patients. Abnormal change 
in serum phosphate levels may be a novel biomarker for early prediction of SAKI 
occurrence.

BACKGROUND: High Neutrophil-to-Lymphocyte Ratio (NLR), Monocyte-to-Lymphocyte 
Ratio (MLR), Platelet-to-Lymphocyte Ratio (PLR) were associated with worse 
prognosis of patients with sepsis. In-hospital mortality has been reported to be 
higher in patients with coronary artery disease (CAD) and sepsis than those with 
sepsis alone. However, the relationship between NLR, MLR, PLR and mortality in 
septic patients with coronary artery disease (CAD) remains unclear. The study 
aimed to explore the association between NLR, MLR, PLR and 28-day all-cause 
mortality in septic patients with CAD.
METHODS: We performed an observational cohort study of septic patients with CAD 
from the Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care (MIMIC)-IV database between 
2008 and 2019. The patients were categorized by three group (Q1: low levels, Q2: 
medium levels, Q3: high levels) based on tertiles of NLR, MLR, and PLR. The 
associations between NLR, MLR, PLR and 28-day all-cause mortality were examined 
using the Cox proportional hazards model. Subsequently, we applied receiver 
operating characteristic (ROC) analysis for predicting 28-day mortality in 
septic patients with CAD by combining NLR, MLR and PLR with the modified 
sequential organ failure assessment (mSOFA) scores.
RESULTS: Overall 1,175 septic patients with CAD were included in the study. 
Observed all-cause mortality rates in 28 days were 27.1%. Multivariate Cox 
proportional hazards regression analysis results showed that 28-day all-cause 
mortality of septic patients with CAD was significantly related to rising NLR 
levels (adjusted hazard ratio [aHR]: 1.02; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 
1.01-1.02; P < 0.001), MLR levels (aHR: 1.29; 95%CI: 1.18-1.41; P < 0.001), and 
PLR levels (aHR: 1.0007; 95%CI: 1.0004-1.0011; P < 0.001). Meanwhile, the higher 
levels (Q3) group of NLR, MLR, and PLR also had a higher risk of 28-day 
all-cause mortality than the lower (Q1) group. The area under the ROC curve of 
NLR, MLR, PLR, and mSOFA score were 0.630 (95%CI 0.595-0.665), 0.611 (95%CI 
0.576-0.646), 0.601 (95%CI 0.567-0.636) and 0.718 (95%CI 0.689-0.748), 
respectively. Combining NLR, MLR, and PLR with mSOFA scores may improve ability 
of predicting 28-day mortality (AUC: 0.737, 95%CI 0.709-0.766).
CONCLUSION: Higher levels of NLR, MLR and PLR were associated with 28-day 
all-cause mortality in septic patients with CAD. Further investigation will be 
needed to improve understanding of the pathophysiology of this relationship.

BACKGROUND: Sepsis-associated acute kidney injury (S-AKI) is a major contributor 
to mortality in intensive care units (ICU). Early prediction of mortality risk 
is crucial to enhance prognosis and optimize clinical decisions. This study aims 
to develop a 28-day mortality risk prediction model for S-AKI utilizing an 
explainable ensemble machine learning (ML) algorithm.
METHODS: This study utilized data from the Medical Information Mart for 
Intensive Care IV (MIMIC-IV 2.0) database to gather information on patients with 
S-AKI. Univariate regression, correlation analysis and Boruta were combined for 
feature selection. To construct the four ML models, hyperparameters were tuned 
via random search and five-fold cross-validation. To evaluate the performance of 
all models, ROC, K-S, and LIFT curves were used. The discrimination of ML models 
and traditional scoring systems was compared using area under the receiver 
operating characteristic curve (AUC). Additionally, the SHapley Additive 
exPlanation (SHAP) was utilized to interpret the ML model and identify essential 
variables. To investigate the relationship between the top nine continuous 
variables and the risk of 28-day mortality. COX regression-restricted cubic 
splines were utilized while controlling for age and comorbidities.
RESULTS: The study analyzed data from 9,158 patients with S-AKI, dividing them 
into a 28-day mortality group of 1,940 and a survival group of 7,578. The 
results showed that XGBoost was the best performing model of the four ML models 
with AUC of 0.873. All models outperformed APS-III 0.713 and SAPS-II 0.681. The 
K-S and LIFT curves indicated XGBoost as the most effective predictor for 28-day 
mortality risk. The model's performance was evaluated using ROCpr curves, 
calibration curves, accuracy, precision, and F1 scores. SHAP force plots were 
utilized to interpret and visualize the personalized predictive power of the 
28-day mortality risk model. Additionally, COX regression restricted cubic 
splines revealed an interesting non-linear relationship between the top nine 
variables and 28-day mortality.
CONCLUSION: The use of ensemble ML models has shown to be more effective than 
the LR model and conventional scoring systems in predicting 28-day mortality 
risk in S-AKI patients. By visualizing the XGBoost model with the best 
predictive performance, clinicians are able to identify high-risk patients early 
on and improve prognosis.

OBJECTIVE: To compare the characteristics and outcomes of culture-positive 
sepsis (CPS) with culture-negative sepsis (CNS) patients in order to understand 
the impact of CNS on prognosis and explore the possible risk factors for 
mortality.
METHODS: A retrospective cohort study was conducted. Patients with sepsis were 
identified from the Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care database-IV v0.4 
(MIMIC-IV v0.4). Patients were divided into CPS and CNS groups according to the 
culture results within 24 hours before and after the diagnosis of sepsis. 
General information, baseline characteristics, and medical operation data 
between CNS and CPS groups were compared. Logistic regression analysis was used 
to calculate the relationship between CNS and in-hospital mortality under three 
regression models. Chi-square analysis and mediation analysis were used to 
analyze the effect of initial antibiotic and prior antibiotic use within 90 days 
on the in-hospital mortality of CNS.
RESULTS: A total of 8 587 patients with sepsis were enrolled in the final 
analysis, including 5 483 patients in the CPS group and 3 104 patients in the 
CNS group. Compared with the CPS group, the patients in the CNS group were 
younger [years old: 68 (56, 79) vs. 70 (58, 81)], had higher sequential organ 
failure assessment (SOFA) score and higher proportion of using mechanical 
ventilation, renal replacement therapy and vasopressin within 24 hours after 
intensive care unit (ICU) admission [SOFA score: 3 (2, 5) vs. 3 (2, 4), 
mechanical ventilation: 48.61% (1 509/3 104) vs. 39.25% (2 152/5 483), renal 
replacement therapy: 13.69% (425/3 104) vs. 9.68% (531/5 483), vasopressin: 
15.79% (490/3 104) vs. 13.44% (737/5 483)], longer length of ICU stay [days: 5 
(3, 10) vs. 3 (2, 6)] and higher in-hospital mortality [25.00% (776/3 104) vs. 
18.53% (1 016/5 483)], with significant differences (all P < 0.01). However, 
there was no significant difference in gender, ICU type, simplified acute 
physiology score II (SAPS II), and Charlson comorbidity index (CCI) score 
between the two groups. After adjustment for multiple confounding factors, CNS 
was still a risk factor for in-hospital mortality [odds ratio (OR) = 1.441, 95% 
confidence interval (95%CI) was 1.273-1.630, P < 0.001]. The results of 
Chi-square analysis and mediation analysis showed that the initial antibiotic 
had no significant effect on the higher in-hospital mortality of CNS, while the 
prior use of antibiotics within 90 days was related to higher in-hospital 
mortality of CNS (OR = 1.683, 95%CI was 1.328-2.134, P < 0.05). The mediating 
effect of CNS in prior antibiotic use within 90 days and in-hospital death was 
significant (Z = 5.302, P < 0.001), accounting for 7.58%.
CONCLUSIONS: Compared with CPS, CNS was more severe and had a worse prognosis. 
Prior use of antibiotics within 90 days may be related to the higher in-hospital 
mortality of CNS patients, but it could not fully explain the high mortality of 
CNS.

BACKGROUND: Sepsis is a significant health burden on a global scale. Timely 
identification and treatment of sepsis can greatly improve patient outcomes, 
including survival rates. However, time-consuming laboratory results are often 
needed for screening sepsis. We aimed to develop a quick sepsis screening tool 
(qSepsis) based on patients' non-laboratory clinical data at the emergency 
department (ED) using machine learning (ML), and compare its performance with 
established clinical scores.
METHODS: This retrospective study included patients admitted to the ED of 
Zhongnan Hospital of Wuhan University (Wuhan, China) from 1/1/2015 to 5/31/2022. 
Patients who were under 18 years of age, had cardiopulmonary arrest upon arrival 
at the ED, or had missing and abnormal medical record data were excluded. The 
qSepsis was derived by three ML algorithms, including logistic regression (LR), 
random forest (RF), and extreme gradient boosting (XGB). To benchmark the 
existing clinical tools for assessing the risk of sepsis in the ED, qSepsis was 
compared with the Systemic Inflammatory Response Syndrome (SIRS), the Quick 
Sepsis-Related Organ Failure Assessment (qSOFA), and the Modified Early Warning 
Score (MEWS). The external validation was performed with the Medical Information 
Mart for Intensive Care IV ED database (United States), and adopted the same 
inclusion and exclusion criteria. The predictive power of qSepsis and other 
clinical scores was measured using the area under the receiver operating 
characteristic curve (AUROC). The primary outcome of the study was the diagnosis 
of sepsis in the ED based on the Sepsis 3.0 criteria, which served as the basis 
for developing the qSepsis tool.
FINDINGS: A total of 414,864 patients were finally included in the cohort 
(median ([IQR]) patient age, 43 (29, 60) years; 202,730 (48.87%) females, 
212,134 (51.13%) males), and 200,089 in the external testing cohort (median (SD) 
patient age, 57 (39, 71) years; 107,427 (53.69%) females, 92,663 (46.31%) 
males). For internal testing, LR outperformed RF and XGB with an AUROC of 0.862 
(95% CI, 0.855-0.869). In external testing, the AUROC decreased to 0.766 (95% 
CI, 0.758-0.774) for LR, 0.725 (95% CI, 0.717-0.733) for RF, and 0.735 (95% CI, 
0.728-0.742) for XGB. In addition, the AUROC for the qSOFA, MEWS, and SIRS 
scores in external validation cohort were 0.579 (95% CI, 0.563-0.596), 0.600 
(95% CI, 0.578-0.622), and 0.704 (95% CI, 0.683-0.725), respectively. The area 
under the precision-recall curve (AUPRC) for the qSepsis model was 0.213 (95% 
CI: 0.204-0.222). The AUPRC values for the other scores were as follows: SIRS, 
0.071 (95% CI: 0.013-0.099); qSOFA, 0.096 (95% CI: 0.003-0.186); and MEWS, 0.083 
(95% CI: 0.063-0.111).
INTERPRETATION: This retrospective study demonstrated that qSepsis had better 
predictive performance in terms of AUROC and area under the precision-recall 
curve (AUPRC) compared to existing assessment scores. It has the potential to be 
used in pre-hospital settings with limited access to laboratory tests and in the 
ED for quick screening of patients with sepsis. However, due to its low positive 
predictive value (PPV), the false alarms may increase in actual clinical 
practice.

BACKGROUND: Platelets play a critical role in hemostasis and inflammatory 
diseases. Low platelet count and activity have been reported to be associated 
with unfavorable prognosis. This study aims to explore the relationship between 
dynamics in platelet count and in-hospital morality among septic patients and to 
provide real-time updates on mortality risk to achieve dynamic prediction.
METHODS: We conducted a multi-cohort, retrospective, observational study that 
encompasses data on septic patients in the eICU Collaborative Research Database 
(eICU-CRD) and the Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care IV (MIMIC-IV) 
database. The joint latent class model (JLCM) was utilized to identify 
heterogenous platelet count trajectories over time among septic patients. We 
assessed the association between different trajectory patterns and 28-day 
in-hospital mortality using a piecewise Cox hazard model within each trajectory. 
We evaluated the performance of our dynamic prediction model through area under 
the receiver operating characteristic curve, concordance index (C-index), 
accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity calculated at predefined time points.
RESULTS: Four subgroups of platelet count trajectories were identified that 
correspond to distinct in-hospital mortality risk. Including platelet count did 
not significantly enhance prediction accuracy at early stages (day 1 
C-indexDynamic  vs C-indexWeibull: 0.713 vs 0.714). However, our model showed 
superior performance to the static survival model over time (day 14 
C-indexDynamic  vs C-indexWeibull: 0.644 vs 0.617).
CONCLUSIONS: For septic patients in an intensive care unit, the rapid decline in 
platelet counts is a critical prognostic factor, and serial platelet measures 
are associated with prognosis.

Low blood glucose levels and high urea nitrogen levels affect patient prognosis, 
but few studies have investigated whether the blood urea nitrogen to glucose 
(BGR) ratio predicts the risk of death.This retrospective research examined the 
connection between the BGR and 365-day mortality in patients with chronic kidney 
disease (CKD) stages 1-4 admitted to an intensive care unit (ICU). The study 
utilized data from 6,380 patients in the Medical Information Mart for Intensive 
Care IV version 2.2 (MIMIC-IV v2.2), taking into account confounding factors 
such as demographics, vital signs, laboratory indicators, and comorbidities. The 
study employed both univariate and multivariate Cox regression analyses 
stratified by BGR quartiles. Additionally, restricted cubic spline regression 
and inflection point analysis were used to explore the linear relationship 
between BGR and 365-day mortality, while Kaplan-Meier curve analysis was used to 
observe mortality changes under different BGR stratifications. Subgroup and 
mediating effect analyses were performed to evaluate the robustness of BGR's 
effect on 365-day mortality. The study found a cumulative 365-day mortality rate 
of 34.2% among CKD stages 1-4 patients, with a 2.43-fold increase in the risk of 
death associated with BGR and at least a 44% increase in the risk of death for 
each unit increase in BGR (P = 0.022). A significant nonlinear relationship was 
identified, showing a stepwise change in the risk of death with a marked 
increase in the slope of the curve for BGR values below 0.52 and above 0.9 
(P < 0.001). Subgroup analyses indicated interactions between BGR and factors 
such as age, sepsis, first-day antibiotic use, and cerebrovascular disease 
(P < 0.05). In conclusion, this study confirms that BGR is a significant and 
stable predictor of 1-year mortality risk in patients with CKD stages 1-4. 
Interventions aimed at timely adjustment, correction of metabolic imbalances, 
reduction of inflammation, and management of BGR levels are beneficial for 
reducing mortality in this patient population.

OBJECTIVES: Ischaemic stroke (IS) has become a major health problem globally as 
it is one of the leading causes of long-term disability and death. This study 
aimed to evaluate the association between red cell distribution width (RDW) to 
lymphocyte (LYM) ratio (RLR) and 30-day mortality risk in patients with IS.
METHODS: The present study employed a retrospectively cohort study design with 
the adult data extracted from the Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care 
(MIMIC-III, MIMIC-IV) databases between 2001 and 2019. The RLR was measured 
using RDW and LYM. Confounders were adjusted in Cox proportional hazards model. 
The outcome was 30-day mortality. Univariable and multivariable Cox proportional 
hazards models were establised. A further analysis was conducted on the basis of 
subgroup stratification by heart failure (HF) (yes or no), atrial fibrillation 
or flutter (yes or no), hypertension (yes or no), dyslipidemia (yes or no), 
sepsis (yes or no), and age (≥ 65 years and < 65 years).
RESULTS: In this study, 1,127 adult patients with IS were finally identified. 
Among them,818 patients survived (the survival group) and 309 patients died (the 
death group). The mean age was older in individuals from the death group than 
those from the survival group (70.19 years vs. 64.56 years). The elevated levels 
of RLR were linked to an increased risk of mortality within 30 days in patients 
with IS, with an HR of 1.70 (95% CI: 1.34-2.17). Subgroup analyses showed that 
high RLR levels was a significant risk factor for mortality at 30 days 
particularly in IS patients aged ≥ 65 years, HF, no atrial fibrillation or 
flutter, no hypertension, no dyslipidemia, and no sepsis.
CONCLUSION: Our study shows that high levels of RLR were associated with an 
increased risk of 30-day mortality in patients with IS, providing additional 
prognostic information for the treatment and supportive care of these patients.

OBJECTIVE: To investigate the association between early central venous pressure 
(CVP) measurement and mortality in patients with sepsis.
METHODS: The adult patients with sepsis were identified from the health data of 
Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care-III v1.4 (MIMIC-III v1.4). Data of 
all adult patients with sepsis were collected, including gender, age, 
comorbidities, length of survival, total length of hospital stay and intensive 
care unit (ICU) stay, sequential organ failure assessment (SOFA) score, vital 
signs, laboratory test results on the first day, vasoactive agents usage, fluid 
input, urine output and fluid balance on the first day, need for renal 
replacement therapy and mechanical ventilation, diagnosis of sepsis, and the 
time and value of the first CVP measurement in the ICU. Patients were divided 
into early measurement and control groups based on whether or not they had a CVP 
measurement within the first 6 hours of ICU stay. According to the time of the 
first CVP measurement, the patients were subdivided into four subgroups: ≤ 3 
hours, 4-6 hours, 7-12 hours and no measurement within 12 hours. The primary 
endpoint was 28-day mortality. The relationship between initial CVP and 
mortality was analyzed by Lowess smoothing method. Kaplan-Meier survival 
analysis and Log-Rank test were performed for univariate analysis. Cox 
regression analysis was performed for multivariate analysis to estimate the 
relationship between timeliness of CVP measurement and mortality.
RESULTS: A total of 4 733 sepsis patients were enrolled, 1 673 of whom had CVP 
measured within 6 hours of admission to the ICU, and the other 3 060 patients 
served as the control group. There were no differences in demographic 
characteristics and underlying diseases between the two groups, except that the 
early CVP measurement group had less underlying renal failure compared with 
control group. The early CVP measurement group had higher lactic acid (Lac) 
levels and SOFA scores, indicating worse severity of disease as compared with 
control group. The 28-day mortality in the early CVP measurement group was 
significantly lower than that in the control group (34.2% vs. 40.7%, P < 0.01). 
The early CVP measurement group had shorter length of total hospitalization and 
longer length of ICU stay, higher rate of mechanical ventilation and vasoactive 
agents dependent, and more fluid input and fluid balanced in the first day of 
ICU stay compared with control group. Lowess smoothing analysis showed that a 
"U"-shaped relationship between initial CVP and mortality was identified, 
suggesting that too high or too low initial CVP was associated with worse 
survival. Kaplan-Meier survival analysis showed that compared with the patients 
without early CVP measurement within 12 hours, the cumulative survival rate of 
patients with CVP measured within 3 hours was significantly higher (66.7% vs. 
59.1%; Log-Rank test: χ2 = 15.810, adjusted P < 0.001); while no significant 
difference was found in patients with CVP measured between 4 hours and 6 hours 
and between 7 hours and 12 hours compared with the patients without early CVP 
measurement within 12 hours (64.4%, 60.3% vs. 59.1%; Log-Rank test: χ2 values 
were 5.630 and 0.100, and adjusted P values were 0.053 and > 0.999, 
respectively). Cox multivariate analysis showed that the Cox proportional risk 
model was established by taking patients without CVP measurement within 12 hours 
as reference, timely CVP measurement after ICU admission was associated with 
reduced 28-day mortality of patients with sepsis [≤ 3 hours: hazard ratio (HR) = 
0.65, 95% confidence interval (95%CI) was 0.55-0.77, P < 0.001; 4-6 hours: HR = 
0.72, 95%CI was 0.60-0.87, P = 0.001; 7-12 hours: HR = 0.80, 95%CI was 
0.66-0.98, P = 0.032] after the confounding variables (gender, age, SOFA score, 
initial Lac, renal failure, maximal blood glucose and white blood cell count, 
and minimal platelet count within 24 hours) were adjusted.
CONCLUSIONS: Early CVP measurement is associated with decreased 28-day mortality 
in patients with sepsis. CVP should be considered as a valuable and easily 
accessible safety parameter during early fluid resuscitation.

INTRODUCTION: Septic patients requiring intensive care unit (ICU) readmission 
are at high risk of mortality, but research focusing on the association of ICU 
readmission due to sepsis and mortality is limited. The aim of this study was to 
develop and validate a machine learning (ML) model for predicting in-hospital 
mortality in septic patients readmitted to the ICU using routinely available 
clinical data.
METHODS: The data used in this study were obtained from the Medical Information 
Mart for Intensive Care (MIMIC-IV, v1.0) database, between 2008 and 2019. The 
study cohort included patients with sepsis requiring ICU readmission. The data 
were randomly split into a training (75%) data set and a validation (25%) data 
set. Nine popular ML models were developed to predict mortality in septic 
patients readmitted to the ICU. The model with the best accuracy and area under 
the curve (A.C.) in the validation cohort was defined as the optimal model and 
was selected for further prediction studies. The SHAPELY Additive explanations 
(SHAP) values and Local Interpretable Model-Agnostic Explanation (LIME) methods 
were used to improve the interpretability of the optimal model.
RESULTS: A total of 1117 septic patients who had required ICU readmission during 
the study period were enrolled in the study. Of these participants, 434 (38.9%) 
were female, and the median (interquartile range [IQR]) age was 68.6 (58.4-79.2) 
years. The median (IQR) ICU interval duration was 2.60 (0.64-5.78) days. After 
feature selection, 31 of 47 clinical factors were ultimately chosen for use in 
model construction. Of the nine ML models tested, the best performance was 
achieved with the random forest (RF) model, with an A.C. of 0.81, an accuracy of 
85% and a precision of 62% in the validation cohort. The SHAP summary analysis 
revealed that Glasgow Coma Scale score, urine output, blood urea nitrogen, 
lactate, platelet count and systolic blood pressure were the top six most 
important factors contributing to the RF model. Additionally, the LIME method 
demonstrated how the RF model works in terms of explaining risk of death 
prediction in septic patients requiring ICU readmission.
CONCLUSION: The ML models reported here showed a good prognostic prediction 
ability in septic patients requiring ICU readmission. Of the features selected, 
the parameters related to organ perfusion made the largest contribution to 
outcome prediction during ICU readmission in septic patients.

Objectives: This present study aimed to infer the association between aspirin 
exposure prior to ICU admission and the clinical outcomes of patients with 
Sepsis-associated acute respiratory failure (S-ARF). Methods: We obtained data 
from the Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care IV 2.0. Patients were 
divided into pre-ICU aspirin exposure group and Non-aspirin exposure group based 
on whether they took aspirin before ICU admission. The primary outcome is 28-day 
mortality. Augmented inverse propensity weighted was used to explore the average 
treatment effect (ATE) of the pre-ICU aspirin exposure. A generalized additive 
mixed model was used to analyze the longitudinal data of neutrophil to 
lymphocyte ratio (NLR), red cell distribution width (RDW), oxygenation index 
(P/F), dynamic lung compliance (Cdyn), mechanical power (MP), and mechanical 
power normalized to predicted body weight (WMP) in the two groups. A multiple 
mediation model was constructed to explore the possible mediators between 
pre-ICU aspirin exposure and outcomes of patients with S-ARF. Results: A total 
of 2090 S-ARF patients were included in this study. Pre-ICU aspirin exposure 
decreased 28-day mortality (ATE, -0.1945, 95% confidence interval [CI], -0.2786 
to -0.1103, p < 0.001), 60-day mortality (ATE, -0.1781, 95% Cl, -0.2647 to 
-0.0915, p < 0.001), and hospital mortality (ATE, -0.1502, 95%CI, -0.2340 to 
-0.0664, p < 0.001). In subgroup analysis, the ATE for 28-day mortality, 60-day 
mortality, and hospital mortality were not statistically significant in the 
coronary care unit group, high-dose group (over 100 mg/d), and no invasive 
mechanical ventilation (IMV) group. After excluding these non-beneficiaries, 
Cdyn and P/F ratio of the pre-ICU aspirin exposure group increased by 
0.31mL/cmH2O (SE, 0.21, p = 0.016), and 0.43 mmHg (SE, 0.24, p = 0.041) every 
hour compared to that of non-aspirin exposure group after initialing IMV. The 
time-weighted average of NLR, Cdyn, WMP played a mediating role of 8.6%, 24.7%, 
and 13% of the total effects of pre-ICU aspirin exposure and 28-day mortality, 
respectively. Conclusion: Pre-ICU aspirin exposure was associated with decreased 
28-day mortality, 60-day mortality, and hospital mortality in S-ARF patients 
except those admitted to CCU, and those took a high-dose aspirin or did not 
receive IMV. The protective effect of aspirin may be mediated by a low dynamic 
level of NLR and a high dynamic level of Cdyn and WMP. The findings should be 
interpreted cautiously, given the sample size and potential for residual 
confounding.

AIM: This study aimed to investigate the associations of serum lactate level 
[within and after 24 h of the intensive care unit (ICU) admission] and lactate 
clearance rate with delirium and assess associations of lactate and lactate 
clearance rate with 30-day mortality in delirium patients.
METHODS: Data in this retrospective cohort study were extracted from the Medical 
Information Mart for Intensive Care IV (MIMIC-IV) database in 2012-2019. The 
associations of lactate and lactate clearance rate with delirium were explored 
through univariable and multivariable logistic regression analyses, whereas the 
associations of lactate and lactate clearance rate with 30-day mortality in 
delirium patients were investigated using univariable and multivariable Cox 
regression analyses. Subgroup analysis was performed for age, gender, sepsis, 
hypertension, sedative drug, ventilation, antibiotic drug, vasopressors, and the 
Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (SOFA) score. The evaluation indexes were 
odds ratios (ORs), hazard ratios (HRs), and 95% confidence intervals (CIs).
RESULTS: Among 7,812 (14.58%) eligible participants, 4,338 (8.19%) had delirium 
and 1,903 (24.36%) died within 30 days. After adjusting for covariates, patients 
with lactic acidosis (lactate level > 5 mmol/L and PH < 7.35) at T0 (within 24 h 
of the ICU admission) had higher odds of delirium (OR = 1.235, 95%CI: 
1.105-1.382). Hyperlactatemia (lactate level 2-5 mmol/L and PH > 7.35) at T1 
(after 24 h of the ICU admission) was also associated with higher odds of 
delirium (OR = 1.277, 95%CI: 1.126-1.447). Lactate clearance rate > 50% was 
linked to lower odds of delirium (OR = 0.705, 95%CI: 0.613-0.811), and this 
relationship was also observed in ≥65 years old, female, male, non-sepsis, 
sepsis, non-hypertension, non-sedative drug use, sedative drug use, ventilation, 
antibiotic drug use, use of vasopressors, and different SOFA score subgroups 
(all p < 0.05). Additionally, hyperlactatemia and lactic acidosis (whether at T0 
or T1) may be potential risk factors for 30-day mortality in delirium patients, 
whereas lactate clearance rate ≥ 0 had a potential protective effect on 30-day 
mortality (all p < 0.05).
CONCLUSION: Higher serum lactate levels in the early stage of the ICU were 
associated with a higher risk of delirium and subsequent mortality. Measures 
taken to increase the lactate clearance rate are necessary to reduce potential 
delirium or mortality risk in clinical settings. However, more evidence from 
prospective studies is needed to verify these findings.

OBJECTIVE: Coagulopathy score has been applied as a new prognostic indicator for 
sepsis, heart failure and acute respiratory failure. However, its ability to 
forecast intensive care unit (ICU) mortality in patients with an acute cerebral 
hemorrhage (ICH) has not been assessed. The purpose of this study was to clarify 
the relationship between ICU mortality and early coagulation problem score.
METHODS: Data from the Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care (MIMIC-IV) 
(v2.0) database were used in this retrospective cohort analysis. The association 
between the coagulation disorder score and ICU mortality was examined using 
multivariate logistic regression. Furthermore, the impact of additional 
variables on the results was investigated by a subgroup analysis.
RESULTS: 3174 patients (57.3 % male) were enrolled in total. The ICU mortality 
reached 18.2 %. After adjusting for potential confounders, the ICU mortality of 
patients rose with the increase of coagulation disorder score. The ROC curve 
revealed the predictive accuracy of coagulation dysfunction score to mortality 
in patients with ICU. The coagulation disorder score had a lower AUC value 
(0.601, P < 0.001) than the SAPSII(AUCs of 0.745[95 % CI, 0.730-0.761]) and the 
combined indicators(AUCs of 0.752[95 % CI, 0.737-0.767]), but larger than single 
indicators platelet, INR and APTT. In the subgroup analysis, most subgroups 
showed no significant interaction, but only age showed significant interaction 
in the adjusted model.
CONCLUSION: The coagulopathy score and ICU mortality were found to be strongly 
positively correlated in this study, and its ability to predict ICU mortality 
was better than that of a single measure (platelet, INR, or APTT), but worse 
than that of the SAPSII score, GCS system.

BACKGROUND: Stroke is a disease characterized by sudden cerebral ischemia and is 
the second leading cause of death worldwide. We aimed to develop and validate a 
nomogram model to predict mortality in intensive care unit patients with stroke.
METHODS: All data involved in this study were extracted from the Medical 
Information Mart for Intensive Care III database (MIMIC-III). The data were 
analyzed using multivariate Cox regression, and the performance of the novel 
nomogram, which assessed the patient's overall survival at 30, 180, and 360 days 
after stroke, was evaluated using Harrell's concordance index (C-index) and the 
area under the receiver operating characteristic curve. A calibration curve and 
decision curve were introduced to test the clinical value and effectiveness of 
our prediction model.
RESULTS: A total of 767 patients with stroke were randomly divided into 
derivation (n = 536) and validation (n = 231) cohorts at a 7:3 ratio. 
Multivariate Cox regression showed that 12 independent predictors, including 
age, weight, ventilation, cardiac arrhythmia, metastatic cancer, explicit 
sepsis, Oxford Acute Severity of Illness Score or OASIS score, diastolic blood 
pressure, bicarbonate, chloride, red blood cell and white blood cell counts, 
played a significant role in the survival of individuals with stroke. The 
nomogram model was validated based on the C-indices, calibration plots, and 
decision curve analysis results.
CONCLUSIONS: The plotted nomogram accurately predicted stroke outcomes and, thus 
may contribute to clinical decision-making and treatment as well as consultation 
services for patients.

OBJECTIVE: To investigate the correlation of hemoglobin (Hb) level with 
prognosis of elderly patients diagnosed as sepsis.
METHODS: A retrospective cohort study was conducted. Information on the cases of 
elderly patients with sepsis in the Medical Information Mart for Intensive 
Care-IV (MIMIC-IV), including basic information, blood pressure, routine blood 
test results [the Hb level of a patient was defined as his/her maximum Hb level 
from 6 hours before admission to intensive care unit (ICU) and 24 hours after 
admission to ICU], blood biochemical indexes, coagulation function, vital signs, 
severity score and outcome indicators were extracted. The curves of Hb level vs. 
28-day mortality risk were developed by using the restricted cubic spline model 
based on the Cox regression analysis. The patients were divided into four groups 
(Hb < 100 g/L, 100 g/L ≤ Hb < 130 g/L, 130 g/L ≤ Hb < 150 g/L, Hb ≥ 150 g/L 
groups) based on these curves. The outcome indicators of patients in each group 
were analyzed, and the 28-day Kaplan-Meier survival curve was drawn. Logistic 
regression model and Cox regression model were used to analyze the relationship 
between Hb level and 28-day mortality risk in different groups.
RESULTS: A total of 7 473 elderly patients with sepsis were included. There was 
a "U" curve relationship between Hb levels within 24 hours after ICU admission 
and the risk of 28-day mortality in patients with sepsis. The patients with 100 
g/L ≤ Hb < 130 g/L had a lower risk of 28-day mortality. When Hb level was less 
than 100 g/L, the risk of death decreased gradually with the increase of Hb 
level. When Hb level was ≥ 130 g/L, the risk of death gradually increased with 
the increase of Hb level. Multivariate Logistic regression analysis revealed 
that the mortality risks of patients with Hb < 100 g/L [odds ratio (OR) = 1.44, 
95% confidence interval (95%CI) was 1.23-1.70, P < 0.001] and Hb ≥ 150 g/L (OR = 
1.77, 95%CI was 1.26-2.49, P = 0.001) increased significantly in the model 
involving all confounding factors; the mortality risks of patients with 130 g/L 
≤ Hb < 150 g/L increased, while the difference was not statistically significant 
(OR = 1.21, 95%CI was 0.99-1.48, P = 0.057). The multivariate Cox regression 
analysis suggested that the mortality risks of patients with Hb < 100 g/L 
[hazard ratio (HR) = 1.27, 95%CI was 1.12-1.44, P < 0.001] and Hb ≥ 150 g/L (HR 
= 1.49, 95%CI was 1.16-1.93, P = 0.002) increased significantly in the model 
involving all confounding factors; the mortality risks of patients with 130 g/L 
≤ Hb < 150 g/L increased, while the difference was not statistically significant 
(HR = 1.17, 95%CI was 0.99-1.37, P = 0.053). Kaplan-Meier survival curve showed 
that the 28-day survival rate of elderly septic patients in 100 g/L ≤ Hb < 130 
g/L group was significantly higher than that in Hb < 100 g/L, 130 g/L ≤ Hb < 150 
g/L and Hb ≥ 150 g/L groups (85.26% vs. 77.33%, 79.81%, 74.33%; Log-Rank test: 
χ2 = 71.850, P < 0.001).
CONCLUSIONS: Elderly patients with sepsis exhibited low mortality risk if their 
100 g/L ≤ Hb < 130 g/L within 24 hours after admission to ICU, and both higher 
and lower Hb levels led to increased mortality risks.

OBJECTIVE: To investigate the correlation between early-stage blood pressure 
indexes and prognosis in sepsis patients.
METHODS: A retrospective cohort study was conducted on the medical records of 
patients diagnosed with sepsis from 2001 to 2012 in the Medical Information Mart 
for Intensive Care-III (MIMIC-III) database. Patients were divided into survival 
group and death group according to the 28-day prognosis. General data of 
patients and heart rate (HR) and blood pressure at admission to ICU and within 
24 hours after admission were collected. The blood pressure indexes including 
the maximum, median and mean value of systolic index, diastolic index and mean 
arterial pressure (MAP) index were calculated. The data were randomly divided 
into training set and validation set (4 : 1). Univariate Logistic regression 
analysis was used to screen covariates, and multivariate Logistic stepwise 
regression models were further developed. Model 1 (including HR, blood pressure, 
and blood pressure index related variables with P < 0.1 and other variables with 
P < 0.05) and Model 2 (including HR, blood pressure, and blood pressure index 
related variables with P < 0.1) were developed respectively. The receiver 
operator characteristic curve (ROC curve), precision recall curve (PRC) and 
decision curve analysis (DCA) curve were used to evaluate the quality of the two 
models, and the influencing factors of the prognosis of sepsis patients were 
analyzed. Finally, nomogram model was developed according to the better model 
and effectiveness of it was evaluated.
RESULTS: A total of 11 559 sepsis patients were included in the study, with 10 
012 patients in the survival group and 1 547 patients in the death group. There 
were significant differences in age, survival time, Elixhauser comorbidity score 
and other 46 variables between the two groups (all P < 0.05). Thirty-seven 
variables were preliminarily screened by univariate Logistic regression 
analysis. After multivariate Logistic stepwise regression model screening, among 
the indicators related to HR, blood pressure and blood pressure index, the HR at 
admission to ICU [odds ratio (OR) = 0.992, 95% confidence interval (95%CI) was 
0.988-0.997] and the maximum HR (OR = 1.006, 95%CI was 1.001-1.011), maximum MAP 
index (OR = 1.620, 95%CI was 1.244-2.126), mean diastolic index (OR = 0.283, 
95%CI was 0.091-0.856), median systolic index (OR = 2.149, 95%CI was 
0.805-4.461), median diastolic index (OR = 3.986, 95%CI was 1.376-11.758) were 
selected (all P < 0.1). There were 14 other variables with P < 0.05, including 
age, Elixhauser comorbidity score, continuous renal replacement therapy (CRRT), 
use of ventilator, sedation and analgesia, norepinephrine, norepinephrine, 
highest serum creatinine (SCr), maximum blood urea nitrogen (BUN), highest 
prothrombin time (PT), highest activated partial thromboplastin time (APTT), 
lowest platelet count (PLT), highest white blood cell count (WBC), minimum 
hemoglobin (Hb). The ROC curve showed that the area under the curve (AUC) of 
Model 1 and Model 2 were 0.769 and 0.637, respectively, indicating that model 1 
had higher prediction accuracy. The PRC curve showed that the AUC of Model 1 and 
Model 2 were 0.381 and 0.240, respectively, indicating that Model 1 had a better 
effect. The DCA curve showed that when the threshold was 0-0.8 (the probability 
of death was 0-80%), the net benefit rate of Model 1 was higher than that of 
Model 2. The calibration curve showed that the prediction effect of the nomogram 
model developed according to Model 1 was in good agreement with the actual 
outcome. The Bootstrap verification results showed that the nomogram model was 
consistent with the above results and had good prediction effects.
CONCLUSIONS: The nomogram model constructed has good prediction effects on the 
28-day prognosis in sepsis patients, and the blood pressure indexes are 
important predictors in the model.

OBJECTIVE: To investigate the association between the glucose-to-lymphocyte 
ratio (GLR) and prognosis of patients with sepsis-associated acute kidney injury 
(SA-AKI).
METHODS: Based on the Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care-IV (MIMIC-IV), 
SA-AKI patients aged ≥ 18 years were selected. According to the tertiles of GLR, 
the patients were divided into GLR1 group (GLR ≤ 4.97×10-9 mmol), GLR2 group 
(4.97×10-9 mmol < GLR < 9.75×10-9 mmol) and GLR3 group (GLR ≥ 9.75×10-9 mmol). 
Patients with SA-AKI were divided into survival group and death group according 
to whether they survived 28 days after admission. The patient's gender, age, 
vital signs, laboratory test results, comorbidities, sequential organ failure 
assessment (SOFA), acute physiology score III (APS III) score and treatment 
measures were extracted from the database. Kaplan-Meier survival analysis was 
used to make the survival curves of patients with SA-AKI at 28 days, 90 days, 
180 days and 1 year. Multivariate Logistic regression analysis model was used to 
explore the independent risk factors of 28-day mortality in patients with 
SA-AKI. Receiver operator characteristic curve (ROC curve) was used to analyze 
the predictive efficacy of GLR for the prognosis of patients with SA-AKI.
RESULTS: A total of 1 524 patients with SA-AKI were included, with a median age 
of 68.28 (58.96, 77.24) years old, including 612 females (40.16%) and 912 males 
(59.84%). There were 507 patients in the GLR1 group, 509 patients in the GLR2 
group and 508 patients in the GLR3 group. There were 1 181 patients in the 
28-day survival group and 343 patients in the death group. Grouping according to 
GLR tertiles showed that with the increase of GLR, the 28-day, 90-day, 180-day 
and 1-year mortality of SA-AKI patients gradually increased (28-day mortality 
were 11.64%, 22.00%, 33.86%, respectively; 90-day mortality were 15.98%, 26.72%, 
40.55%, respectively; 180-day mortality were 17.16%, 28.29% and 41.73%, and the 
1-year mortality were 17.95%, 29.27% and 42.72%, respectively, all P < 0.01). 
According to 28-day survival status, the GLR of the death group was 
significantly higher than that of the survival group [×10-9 mmol: 9.81 (5.75, 
20.01) vs. 6.44 (3.64, 10.78), P < 0.01]. Multivariate Logistic regression 
analysis showed that GLR was an independent risk factor for 28-day mortality in 
patients with SA-AKI [when GLR was used as a continuous variable: odds ratio 
(OR) = 1.065, 95% confidence interval (95%CI) was 1.045-1.085, P < 0.001; when 
GLR was used as a categorical variable, compared with GLR1 group: GLR2 group OR 
= 1.782, 95%CI was 1.200-2.647, P = 0.004; GLR3 group OR = 2.727, 95%CI was 
1.857-4.005, P < 0.001]. ROC curve analysis showed that the area under the ROC 
curve (AUC) of GLR for predicting 28-day mortality in patients with SA-AKI was 
0.674, when the optimal cut-off value was 8.769×10-9 mmol, the sensitivity was 
57.1% and the specificity was 67.1%. The predictive performance was improved 
when GLR was combined with APS III score and SOFA score, and the AUC was 0.806, 
the sensitivity was 74.6% and the specificity was 71.4%.
CONCLUSIONS: GLR is an independent risk factor of 28-day mortality in patients 
with SA-AKI, and high GLR is associated with poor prognosis in patients with 
SA-AKI.

OBJECTIVE: This research aims to investigate the prognosis value using the 
time-weighted average neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio (TWA-NLR) for predicting 
all-cause hospital mortality among sepsis patients. Data were analyzed through 
the use of the eICU Collaborative Research Database (eICU-CRD 2.0) as well as 
Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care IV 2.2 (MIMIC-IV 2.2).
METHODS: Septic patients from both eICU-CRD 2.0 as well as MIMIC-IV 2.2 
databases were included. The neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratios (NLR) were 
available for analysis, utilizing complete blood counts obtained on days one, 
four, and seven following ICU admission. The TWA-NLR was computed at the end of 
the seven days, and patients were then stratified based on TWA-NLR thresholds. 
90-day all-cause mortality during hospitalization was the primary objective, 
with 60-day all-cause hospital mortality as a secondary objective. The 
correlation between TWA-NLR and sepsis patients' primary outcome was analyzed 
using univariable and multivariable Cox proportional hazard regressions. A 
restricted cubic spline (RCS) analysis was conducted in an attempt to confirm 
this association further, and subgroup analyses were employed to evaluate the 
correlation across various comorbidity groups.
RESULTS: 3921 patients were included from the eICU-CRD 2.0, and the hospital 
mortality rate was 20.8 %. Both multivariable as well as univariable Cox 
proportional hazard regression analyses revealed that TWA-NLR was independently 
correlated with 90-day all-cause hospital mortality, yielding a hazard ratio 
(HR) of 1.02 (95 % CI 1.01-1.02, P-value<0.01) as well as 1.12 (95 % CI 
1.01-1.15, P-value<0.01), respectively. The RCS analysis demonstrated a 
significant nonlinear relationship between TWA-NLR and 90-day all-cause hospital 
mortality risk. The study subjects were divided into higher (>10.5) and lower 
(≤10.5) TWA-NLR cohorts. A significantly decreased incidence of 90-day all-cause 
hospital mortality (HR = 0.56, 95 % CI 0.48-0.64, P-value<0.01) and longer 
median survival time (40 days vs 24 days, P-value<0.05) were observed in the 
lower TWA-NLR cohort. However, septic patients with chronic pulmonary 
(interaction of P-value = 0.009) or renal disease (interaction of 
P-value = 0.008) exhibited significant interactive associations between TWA-NLR 
and 90-day all-cause hospital mortality, suggesting the predictive power of 
TWA-NLR may be limited in these subgroups. The MIMIC-IV 2.2 was utilized as a 
validation cohort and exhibited a similar pattern.
CONCLUSION: Our findings suggest that TWA-NLR is a powerful and independent 
prognostic indicator for 90-day all-cause hospital mortality among septic 
patients, and the TWA-NLR cutoff value may prove a useful method for identifying 
high-risk septic patients.

BACKGROUND: Acinetobacter baumanni infection is a leading cause of morbidity and 
mortality in the Intensive Care Unit (ICU). Early recognition of patients at 
risk for infection allows early proper treatment and is associated with improved 
outcomes. This study aimed to construct an innovative Machine Learning (ML) 
based prediction tool for Acinetobacter baumanni infection, among patients in 
the ICU, and to examine its robustness and predictive power.
METHODS: For model development and internal validation, we used The Medical 
Information Mart for Intensive Care database (MIMIC) III data from 19,690 
consecutive adult patients admitted between 2001 and 2012 at a Boston tertiary 
center ICU. For external validation, we used a different dataset from Rabin 
Medical Center (RMC, Israeli tertiary center) ICU, of 1,700 patients admitted 
between 2017 and 2021. After training on MIMIC cohorts, we adapted the algorithm 
from MIMIC to RMC and evaluated its discriminating power in terms of Area Under 
the Receiver Operating Curve (AUROC), sensitivity, specificity, Negative 
Predictive Value and Positive Predictive Value.
RESULTS: The prediction model achieved AUROC = 0.624 (95% CI 0.604-0.647). The 
most significant predictors were (i) physiological parameters of 
cardio-respiratory function, such as carbon dioxide (CO2) levels and respiratory 
rate, (ii) metabolic disturbances such as lactate and acidosis (pH) and (iii) 
past administration of antibiotics.
CONCLUSIONS: Infection with Acinetobacter baumanni is more likely to occur in 
patients with respiratory failure and higher lactate levels, as well as patients 
who have used larger amounts of antibiotics. The accuracy of Acinetobacter 
prediction may be enhanced by future studies.

Introduction: Septic patients with atrial fibrillation (AF) are common in the 
intensive care unit accompanied by high mortality. The early prediction of 
prognosis of these patients is critical for clinical intervention. This study 
aimed to develop a model by using machine learning (ML) algorithms to predict 
the risk of 28-day mortality in septic patients with AF. Methods: In this 
retrospective cohort study, we extracted septic patients with AF from the 
Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care III (MIMIC-III) and IV database. 
Afterward, only MIMIC-IV cohort was randomly divided into training or internal 
validation set. External validation set was mainly extracted from MIMIC-III 
database. Propensity score matching was used to reduce the imbalance between the 
external validation and internal validation data sets. The predictive factors 
for 28-day mortality were determined by using multivariate logistic regression. 
Then, we constructed models by using ML algorithms. Multiple metrics were used 
for evaluation of performance of the models, including the area under the 
receiver operating characteristic curve, sensitivity, specificity, recall, and 
accuracy. Results: A total of 5,317 septic patients with AF were enrolled, with 
3,845 in the training set, 960 in the internal testing set, and 512 in the 
external testing set, respectively. Then, we established four prediction models 
by using ML algorithms. AdaBoost showed moderate performance and had a higher 
accuracy than the other three models. Compared with other severity scores, the 
AdaBoost obtained more net benefit. Conclusion: We established the first ML 
model for predicting the 28-day mortality of septic patients with AF. Compared 
with conventional scoring systems, the AdaBoost model performed moderately. The 
model established will have the potential to improve the level of clinical 
practice.

BACKGROUND: Patients with heart failure (HF) with diabetes may face a poorer 
prognosis and higher mortality than patients with either disease alone, 
especially for those in intensive care unit. So far, there is no precise 
mortality risk prediction indicator for this kind of patient.
METHOD: Two high-quality critically ill databases, the Medical Information Mart 
for Intensive Care IV (MIMIC-IV) database and the Telehealth Intensive Care Unit 
(eICU) Collaborative Research Database (eICU-CRD) Collaborative Research 
Database, were used for study participants' screening as well as internal and 
external validation. Nine machine learning models were compared, and the best 
one was selected to define indicators associated with hospital mortality for 
patients with HF with diabetes. Existing attributes most related to hospital 
mortality were identified using a visualization method developed for machine 
learning, namely, Shapley Additive Explanations (SHAP) method. A new composite 
indicator ASL was established using logistics regression for patients with HF 
with diabetes based on major existing indicators. Then, the new index was 
compared with existing indicators to confirm its discrimination ability and 
clinical value using the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve, decision 
curve, and calibration curve.
RESULTS: The random forest model outperformed among nine models with the area 
under the ROC curve (AUC) = 0.92 after hyper-parameter optimization. By using 
this model, the top 20 attributes associated with hospital mortality in these 
patients were identified among all the attributes based on SHAP method. Acute 
Physiology Score (APS) III, Sepsis-related Organ Failure Assessment (SOFA), and 
Max lactate were selected as major attributes related to mortality risk, and a 
new composite indicator was developed by combining these three indicators, which 
was named as ASL. Both in the initial and external cohort, the new indicator, 
ASL, had greater risk discrimination ability with AUC higher than 0.80 in both 
low- and high-risk groups compared with existing attributes. The decision curve 
and calibration curve indicated that this indicator also had a respectable 
clinical value compared with APS III and SOFA. In addition, this indicator had a 
good risk stratification ability when the patients were divided into three risk 
levels.
CONCLUSION: A new composite indicator for predicting mortality risk in patients 
with HF with diabetes admitted to intensive care unit was developed on the basis 
of attributes identified by the random forest model. Compared with existing 
attributes such as APS III and SOFA, the new indicator had better discrimination 
ability and clinical value, which had potential value in reducing the mortality 
risk of these patients.

BACKGROUND: Trauma patients admitted to critical care are at high risk of 
mortality because of their injuries. Our aim was to develop a machine 
learning-based model to predict mortality using Fahad-Liaqat-Ahmad Intensive 
Machine (FLAIM) framework. We hypothesized machine learning could be applied to 
critically ill patients and would outperform currently used mortality scores.
METHODS: The current Deep-FLAIM model evaluates the statistically significant 
risk factors and then supply these risk factors to deep neural network to 
predict mortality in trauma patients admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU). 
We analyzed adult patients (≥18 years) admitted to the trauma ICU in the 
publicly available database Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care III 
version 1.4. The first phase selection of risk factor was done using 
Cox-regression univariate and multivariate analyses. In the second phase, we 
applied deep neural network and other traditional machine learning models like 
Linear Discriminant Analysis, Gaussian Naïve Bayes, Decision Tree Model, and 
k-nearest neighbor models.
RESULTS: We identified a total of 3,041 trauma patients admitted to the trauma 
surgery ICU. We observed that several clinical and laboratory-based variables 
were statistically significant for both univariate and multivariate analyses 
while others were not. With most significant being serum anion gap (hazard ratio 
[HR], 2.46; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.94-3.11), sodium (HR, 2.11; 95% CI, 
1.61-2.77), and chloride (HR, 2.11; 95% CI, 1.69-2.64) abnormalities on 
laboratories, while clinical variables included the diagnosis of sepsis (HR, 
2.03; 95% CI, 1.23-3.37), Quick Sequential Organ Failure Assessment score (HR, 
1.52; 95% CI, 1.32-3.76). And Systemic Inflammatory Response Syndrome criteria 
(HR. 1.41; 95% CI, 1.24-1.26). After we used these clinically significant 
variables and applied various machine learning models to the data, we found out 
that our proposed DNN outperformed all the other methods with test set accuracy 
of 92.25%, sensitivity of 79.13%, and specificity of 94.16%; positive predictive 
value, 66.42%; negative predictive value, 96.87%; and area under the curve of 
the receiver-operator curve of 0.91 (1.45-1.29).
CONCLUSION: Our novel Deep-FLAIM model outperformed all other machine learning 
models. The model is easy to implement, user friendly and with high accuracy.

Patients with positive blood cultures in the intensive care unit (ICU) are at 
high risk for septic acute kidney injury requiring continuous kidney replacement 
therapy (CKRT), especially when treated with vancomycin. This study developed a 
machine learning model to predict CKRT and examined vancomycin's impact using 
deep learning-based causal inference. We analyzed ICU patients with positive 
blood cultures, utilizing the Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care III 
data set. The primary outcome was defined as the initiation of CKRT during the 
ICU stay. The machine learning models were developed to predict the outcome. The 
deep learning-based causal inference model was utilized to quantitatively 
demonstrate the impact of vancomycin on the probability of CKRT initiation. 
Logistic regression was performed to analyze the relationship between the 
variables and the susceptibility of vancomycin. A total of 1,318 patients were 
included in the analysis, with 41 requiring CKRT. The Random Forest and Light 
Gradient Boosting Machine exhibited the best performance, with Area Under Curve 
of Receiver Operating Characteristic Curve values of 0.905 and 0.886, 
respectively. The deep learning-based causal inference model demonstrated an 
average 7.7% increase in the probability of CKRT occurrence when administrating 
vancomycin in total data set. Additionally, that younger age, lower diastolic 
blood pressure, higher heart rate, higher baseline creatinine, and lower 
bicarbonate levels sensitized the probability of CKRT application in response to 
vancomycin treatment. Deep learning-based causal inference models showed that 
vancomycin administration increases CKRT risk, identifying specific patient 
characteristics associated with higher susceptibility.IMPORTANCEThis study 
assesses the impact of vancomycin on the risk of continuous kidney replacement 
therapy (CKRT) in intensive care unit (ICU) patients with blood culture-positive 
infections. Utilizing deep learning-based causal inference and machine learning 
models, the research quantifies how vancomycin administration increases CKRT 
risk by an average of 7.7%. Key variables influencing susceptibility include 
baseline creatinine, diastolic blood pressure, heart rate, and bicarbonate 
levels. These findings offer insights into managing vancomycin-induced kidney 
risk and may inform patient-specific treatment strategies in ICU settings.

OBJECTIVE: Developing and validating a simple and clinically useful dynamic 
nomogram for predicting early acute kidney injury (AKI) in patients with acute 
heart failure (AHF) admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU).
METHODS: Clinical data from patients with AHF were obtained from the Medical 
Information Mart for Intensive Care IV database. The patients with AHF were 
randomly allocated into derivation and validation sets. The independent 
predictors for AKI development in AHF patients were identified through least 
absolute shrinkage and selection operator and multivariate logistic regression 
analyses. A nomogram was developed based on the results of the multivariable 
logistic regression to predict early AKI onset in AHF patients, which was 
subsequently implemented as a web-based calculator for clinical application. An 
evaluation of the nomogram was conducted using discrimination, calibration 
curves, and decision curve analyses (DCA).
RESULTS: After strict screening, 1,338 patients with AHF were included in the 
derivation set, and 3,129 in the validation set. Sepsis, use of human albumin, 
age, mechanical ventilation, aminoglycoside administration, and serum creatinine 
levels were identified as predictive factors for AKI in patients with AHF. The 
discrimination of the nomogram in both the derivation and validation sets was 
0.81 (95% confidence interval: 0.78-0.83) and 0.79 (95% confidence interval: 
0.76-0.83). Additionally, the calibration curve demonstrated that the predicted 
outcomes aligned well with the actual observations. Ultimately, the DCA curves 
indicated that the nomogram exhibited favorable clinical applicability.
CONCLUSION: The nomogram that integrates clinical risk factors and enables the 
personalized prediction of AKI in patients with AHF upon admission to the ICU, 
which has the potential to assist in identifying AHF patients who would derive 
the greatest benefit from interventions aimed at preventing and treating AKI.

Predicting Mortality in Critical Care Patients with Fungemia Using Structured 
and Unstructured Data.

Baxter SL, Klie AR, Saseendrakumar BR, Ye GY, Hogarth M, Nemati S.

Fungemia is a life-threatening infection, but predictive models of in-patient 
mortality in this infection are few. In this study, we developed models 
predicting all-cause in-hospital mortality among 265 fungemic patients in the 
Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care (MIMIC-III) database using both 
structured and unstructured data. Structured data models included multivariable 
logistic regression, extreme gradient boosting, and stacked ensemble models. 
Unstructured data models were developed using Amazon Comprehend Medical and 
BioWordVec embeddings in logistic regression, convolutional neural networks 
(CNNs), and recurrent neural networks (RNNs). We evaluated models trained on all 
notes, notes from only the first three days of hospitalization, and models 
trained on only physician notes. The best-performing structured data model was a 
multivariable logistic regression model that achieved an accuracy of 0.74 and 
AUC of 0.76. Liver disease, acute renal failure, and intubation were some of the 
top features driving prediction in multiple models. CNNs using unstructured data 
achieved similar performance even when trained with notes from only the first 
three days of hospitalization. The best-performing unstructured data models used 
the Amazon Comprehend Medical document classifier and CNNs, achieving accuracy 
ranging from 0.99-1.00, and AUCs of 1.00. Therefore, unstructured data - 
particularly notes composed by physicians - offer added predictive value over 
models based on structured data alone.

OBJECTIVE: To analyze the risk factors related to the prognosis of patients with 
sepsis in intensive care unit (ICU), construct a nomogram model, and verify its 
predictive efficacy.
METHODS: A retrospective cohort study was conducted using data from Medical 
Information Mart for Intensive Care-IV 0.4 [MIMIC-IV (version 2.0)]. The 
information of 6 500 patients with sepsis who meet the diagnostic criteria of 
Sepsis-3 were collected, including demography characteristics, complications, 
laboratory indicators within 24 hours after ICU admission, and final outcome. 
Using a simple random sampling method, the patients were divided into a training 
set and a validation set at a ratio of 7 : 3. The restricted cubic spline (RCS) 
was used to explore whether there was a linear relationship between each 
variable and the prognosis, and the nonlinear variables were truncated into 
categorical variables. All variables were screened by LASSO regression and 
included in multivariate Cox regression analysis to analyze the death risk 
factors in ICU patients with sepsis, and construct a nomograph. The consistency 
index, calibration curve and receiver operator characteristic curve (ROC curve) 
were used to evaluate the prediction efficiency of nomogram model. The decision 
curve analysis (DCA) was used to validate the clinical value of the model and 
its impact on actual decision-making.
RESULTS: Among 6 500 patients with sepsis, 4 551 were in the training set and 1 
949 were in the validation set. The 28-day, 90-day and 1-year mortality in the 
training set were 27.73% (1 262/4 551), 34.76% (1 582/4 551), and 42.98% (1 
956/4 551), respectively, those in the validation set were 27.24% (531/1 949), 
33.91% (661/1 949), and 42.23% (823/1 949), respectively. Both in training set 
and the validation set, compared with the final survival patients, the death 
patients were older, and had higher sequential organ failure assessment (SOFA) 
score and simplified acute physiology score II (SAPS II), more comorbidities, 
less urine output, and more use of vasoactive drugs, kidney replacement therapy, 
and mechanical ventilation. By RCS analysis, the variables with potential 
nonlinear correlation with the prognosis risk of septic patients were 
transformed into categorical variable. The variables screened by LASSO 
regression were enrolled in the multivariate Cox regression model. The results 
showed that age [hazard ratio (HR) = 1.021, 95% confidence interval (95%CI) was 
1.018-1.024], SOFA score (HR = 1.020, 95%CI was 1.000-1.040), SAPS II score > 44 
(HR = 1.480, 95%CI was 1.340-1.634), mean arterial pressure (MAP) ≤ 75 mmHg (1 
mmHg ≈ 0.133 kPa; HR = 1.120, 95%CI was 1.026-1.222), respiratory rate (RR; HR = 
1.044, 95%CI was 1.034-1.055), cerebrovascular disease (HR = 1.620, 95%CI was 
1.443-1.818), malignant tumor (HR = 1.604, 95%CI was 1.447-1.778), severe liver 
disease (HR = 1.330, 95%CI was 1.157-1.530), use of vasoactive drugs within 24 
hours (HR = 1.213, 95%CI was 1.101-1.336), arterial partial pressure of oxygen 
(PaO2; HR = 0.999, 95%CI was 0.998-1.000), blood lactic acid (Lac; HR = 1.066, 
95%CI was 1.053-1.079), blood urea nitrogen (BUN) > 8.9 mmol/L (HR = 1.257, 
95%CI was 1.144-1.381), total bilirubin (TBil; HR = 1.023, 95%CI was 
1.015-1.031), and prothrombin time (PT) > 14.5 s (HR = 1.232, 95%CI was 
1.127-1.347) were associated with the death of ICU patients with sepsis (all P < 
0.05). Based on the above factors, a nomogram model was constructed, and the 
model validation results showed that the consistency index was 0.730. The 
calibration curve showed a good consistency between the predicted results of the 
nomogram model and observed results in the training and validation sets. ROC 
curve analysis showed that the area under the ROC curve (AUC) predicted by the 
nomogram model in the training set and the validation set for 28-day, 90-day and 
1-year death risk was 0.771 (95%CI was 0.756-0.786) and 0.761 (95%CI was 
0.738-0.784), 0.777 (95%CI was 0.763-0.791) and 0.765 (95%CI was 0.744-0.787), 
0.677 (95%CI was 0.648-0.707) and 0.685 (95%CI was 0.641-0.728), respectively. 
DCA analysis showed that the nomogram model had significant net benefits in 
predicting 28-day, 90-day, and 1-year death risk, verifying the clinical value 
of the model and its good impact on actual decision-making.
CONCLUSIONS: The death risk factors related to ICU patients with sepsis include 
age, SOFA score, SAPS II score > 44, MAP ≤ 75 mmHg, RR, cerebrovascular disease, 
malignant tumors, severe liver disease, use of vasoactive drugs within 24 hours, 
PaO2, Lac, BUN, TBil, PT > 14.5 s. The nomogram model constructed based on this 
can predict the death risk of ICU patients with sepsis.

INTRODUCTION: Glomerular diseases, encompassing primary and secondary forms, 
pose significant morbidity and mortality risks. Despite their impact, little is 
known about critically ill patients with primary glomerulopathy admitted to the 
intensive care unit (ICU).
METHODS: We conducted a case‒control study of patients with primary 
glomerulopathy using the Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care IV 
database. Demographic, clinical, and outcome data were collected. Logistic 
regression and mediation analysis were performed to identify predictors of 
hospital and long-term mortality.
RESULTS: Among 50,920 patients, 307 with primary glomerulopathy were included. 
Infectious and cardiovascular-related causes were the main reasons for ICU 
admission, with sepsis being diagnosed in more than half of the patients during 
their ICU stay. The hospital mortality rate was similar to that of the control 
group, with a long-term mortality rate of 29.0% three years post-ICU discharge. 
Reduced urine output and serum albumin were identified as independent predictors 
of hospital mortality, while serum albumin and the Charlson comorbidity index 
were significantly associated with long-term mortality. Notably, although acute 
kidney injury was frequent, it was not significantly associated with mortality. 
Additionally, reduced urine output mediates nearly 25% of the association 
between serum albumin and hospital mortality.
CONCLUSION: Critically ill patients with primary glomerulopathy exhibit unique 
characteristics and outcomes. Although hospital mortality was comparable to that 
of the control group, long-term mortality remained high. The serum albumin 
concentration and Charlson Comorbidity Index score emerged as robust predictors 
of long-term mortality, highlighting the importance of comprehensive risk 
assessment in this population. The lack of an association between acute kidney 
injury and mortality suggests the need for further research to understand the 
complex interplay of factors influencing outcomes in this patient population.

BACKGROUND: Previous studies have shown the association of waiting time in the 
emergency department with the prognosis of critically ill patients, but these 
studies linking the waiting time to clinical outcomes have been inconsistent and 
limited by small sample size.
AIM: To determine the relationship between the waiting time in the emergency 
department and the clinical outcomes for critically ill patients in a large 
sample population.
DESIGN: A retrospective cohort study of 13 634 patients.
METHODS: We used the Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care III database. 
Multivariable logistic regression was used to determine the independent 
relationships of the in-hospital mortality rate with the delayed time and 
different groups. Interaction and stratified analysis were conducted to test 
whether the effect of delayed time differed across various subgroups.
RESULTS: After adjustments, the in-hospital mortality in the ≥6 h group 
increased by 38.1% (OR 1.381, 95% CI 1.221-1.562). Moreover, each delayed hour 
was associated independently with a 1.0% increase in the risk of in-hospital 
mortality (OR 1.010, 95% CI 1.008-1.010). In the stratified analysis, intensive 
care unit (ICU) types, length of hospital stay, length of ICU stay, simplified 
acute physiology score II and diagnostic category were found to have 
interactions with ≥6 h group in in-hospital mortality.
CONCLUSIONS: In this large retrospective cohort study, every delayed hour was 
associated with an increase in mortality. Furthermore, clinicians should be 
cautious of patients diagnosed with sepsis, liver/renal/metabolic diseases, 
internal hemorrhage and cardiovascular disease, and if conditions permit, they 
should give priority to transferring to the corresponding ICUs.

BACKGROUND: This study was performed to develop and validate machine learning 
models for early detection of ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) 24 h before 
diagnosis, so that VAP patients can receive early intervention and reduce the 
occurrence of complications.
PATIENTS AND METHODS: This study was based on the MIMIC-III dataset, which was a 
retrospective cohort. The random forest algorithm was applied to construct a 
base classifier, and the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve 
(AUC), sensitivity and specificity of the prediction model were evaluated. 
Furthermore, We also compare the performance of Clinical Pulmonary Infection 
Score (CPIS)-based model (threshold value ≥ 3) using the same training and test 
data sets.
RESULTS: In total, 38,515 ventilation sessions occurred in 61,532 ICU 
admissions. VAP occurred in 212 of these sessions. We incorporated 42 VAP risk 
factors at admission and routinely measured the vital characteristics and 
laboratory results. Five-fold cross-validation was performed to evaluate the 
model performance, and the model achieved an AUC of 84% in the validation, 74% 
sensitivity and 71% specificity 24 h after intubation. The AUC of our VAP 
machine learning model is nearly 25% higher than the CPIS model, and the 
sensitivity and specificity were also improved by almost 14% and 15%, 
respectively.
CONCLUSIONS: We developed and internally validated an automated model for VAP 
prediction using the MIMIC-III cohort. The VAP prediction model achieved high 
performance based on its AUC, sensitivity and specificity, and its performance 
was superior to that of the CPIS model. External validation and prospective 
interventional or outcome studies using this prediction model are envisioned as 
future work.

After severe infection in osteomyelitis patients in the Intensive Care Unit 
(ICU), there's a higher risk of mortality. However, limited research exists on 
predicting prognosis. Develop a predictive model for 1-year mortality risk in 
ICU-admitted osteomyelitis patients to inform clinical diagnosis and treatment. 
MIMIC IV database was used to retrieve ICU data for osteomyelitis patients. The 
data were randomly split into training and validation sets (7:3 ratio). 
Univariate and multiple logistic regression identified independent predictors of 
one-year mortality and constructed a risk prediction nomogram in the training 
set. Predictive value of the nomogram was assessed using C-indexes, ROC curves, 
DCA, CIC and calibration curves. This study included a total of 1153 
osteomyelitis patients, with 137 deaths within one year. These patients were 
randomly divided into training (N = 807) and validation (N = 346) sets. In the 
training set, multiple features were identified as key predictors of one-year 
mortality in osteomyelitis patients in the ICU. These factors were incorporated 
into the nomogram model, demonstrating good identification performance, with 
AUCs of 0.872 and 0.826 for the training and validation sets, respectively. The 
calibration curve and ROC curve indicate excellent predictive accuracy. DCA 
suggests strong clinical utility and robust predictive efficiency. Further 
analysis through CIC illustrates the clinical effectiveness of this predictive 
model. We have developed a nomogram model to predict the 1-year mortality rate 
for osteomyelitis patients admitted to the ICU, providing valuable predictive 
information for clinical decision-making.

BACKGROUND: Carbapenem-resistant Pseudomonas aeruginosa (CRPA) infection has 
become a major public health concern. The recommendations for monotherapy and 
combination therapy in the current guidelines lack sufficient evidence to 
support them. The primary objective of this study is to determine the 
effectiveness of anti-Infective combination therapy compared to monotherapy in 
achieving clinical success in patients with CRPA infection and risk factors of 
clinical failure of monotherapy.
METHODS: A retrospective study from Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care 
IV (MIMIC-IV) was conducted. We included adults with infections caused by CRPA. 
The outcomes of this study were clinical success, complete clinical success, and 
28-day all-cause mortality.
RESULTS: A total of 279 subjects were finally enrolled. The rate of clinical 
success for combination therapy was higher than that for monotherapy (73.1% 
versus 60.4%, p=0.028). Compared to clinical failure patients, patients in the 
clinical success group were more likely to die within 28 days after CRPA was 
found (48.3% versus 3.6%, p<0.001). In a multivariate logistic regression 
analysis, monotherapy was found to be significantly correlated with clinical 
success (OR, 0.559, 95% CI, 0.321-0.976; p = 0.041).
CONCLUSION: Combination therapy is more effective for CRPA infection patients, 
especially those whose SOFA score is ≥ 2 or whose Charlson comorbidity index is 
≥ 6.

BACKGROUND: Persistent critical illness (PerCI) is an immunosuppressive status. 
The underlying pathophysiology driving PerCI remains incompletely understood. 
The objectives of the study were to identify the biological signature of PerCI 
development, and to construct a reliable prediction model for patients who had 
suffered orthopedic trauma using machine learning techniques.
METHODS: This study enrolled 1257 patients from the Medical Information Mart for 
Intensive Care III (MIMIC-III) database. Lymphocytes were tracked from ICU 
admission to more than 20 days following admission to examine the dynamic 
changes over time. Over 40 possible variables were gathered for investigation. 
Patients were split 80:20 at random into a training cohort (n=1035) and an 
internal validation cohort (n=222). Four machine learning algorithms, including 
random forest, gradient boosting machine, decision tree, and support vector 
machine, and a logistic regression technique were utilized to train and optimize 
models using data from the training cohort. Patients in the internal validation 
cohort were used to validate models, and the optimal one was chosen. Patients 
from two large teaching hospitals were used for external validation (n=113). The 
key metrics that used to assess the prediction performance of models mainly 
included discrimination, calibration, and clinical usefulness. To encourage 
clinical application based on the optimal machine learning-based model, a 
web-based calculator was developed.
RESULTS: 16.0% (201/1257) of all patients had PerCI in the MIMIC-III database. 
The means of lymphocytes (%) were consistently below the normal reference range 
across the time among PerCI patients (around 10.0%), whereas in patients without 
PerCI, the number of lymphocytes continued to increase and began to be in normal 
range on day 10 following ICU admission. Subgroup analysis demonstrated that 
patients with PerCI were in a more serious health condition at admission since 
those patients had worse nutritional status, more electrolyte imbalance and 
infection-related comorbidities, and more severe illness scores. Eight 
variables, including albumin, serum calcium, red cell volume distributing width 
(RDW), blood pH, heart rate, respiratory failure, pneumonia, and the 
Sepsis-related Organ Failure Assessment (SOFA) score, were significantly 
associated with PerCI, according to the least absolute shrinkage and selection 
operator (LASSO) logistic regression model combined with the 10-fold 
cross-validation. These variables were all included in the modelling. In 
comparison to other algorithms, the random forest had the optimal prediction 
ability with the highest area under receiver operating characteristic (AUROC) 
(0.823, 95% CI: 0.757-0.889), highest Youden index (1.571), and lowest Brier 
score (0.107). The AUROC in the external validation cohort was also up to 0.800 
(95% CI: 0.688-0.912). Based on the risk stratification system, patients in the 
high-risk group had a 10.0-time greater chance of developing PerCI than those in 
the low-risk group. A web-based calculator was available at 
https://starxueshu-perci-prediction-main-9k8eof.streamlitapp.com/.
CONCLUSIONS: Patients with PerCI typically remain in an immunosuppressive 
status, but those without PerCI gradually regain normal immunity. The dynamic 
changes of lymphocytes can be a reliable biomarker for PerCI. This work 
developed a reliable model that may be helpful in improving early diagnosis and 
targeted intervention of PerCI. Beneficial interventions, such as improving 
nutritional status and immunity, maintaining electrolyte and acid-base balance, 
curbing infection, and promoting respiratory recovery, are early warranted to 
prevent the onset of PerCI, especially among patients in the high-risk group and 
those with a continuously low level of lymphocytes.

Background: Traumatic brain injury-induced coagulopathy (TBI-IC), is a disease 
with poor prognosis and increased mortality rate. Objectives: Our study aimed to 
identify predictors as well as develop machine learning (ML) models to predict 
the risk of coagulopathy in this population. Methods: ML models were developed 
and validated based on two public databases named Medical Information Mart for 
Intensive Care (MIMIC)-IV and the eICU Collaborative Research Database 
(eICU-CRD). Candidate predictors, including demographics, family history, 
comorbidities, vital signs, laboratory findings, injury type, therapy strategy 
and scoring system were included. Models were compared on area under the curve 
(AUC), accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, positive and negative predictive 
values, and decision curve analysis (DCA) curve. Results: Of 999 patients in 
MIMIC-IV included in the final cohort, a total of 493 (49.35%) patients 
developed coagulopathy following TBI. Recursive feature elimination (RFE) 
selected 15 variables, including international normalized ratio (INR), 
prothrombin time (PT), sepsis related organ failure assessment (SOFA), activated 
partial thromboplastin time (APTT), platelet (PLT), hematocrit (HCT), red blood 
cell (RBC), hemoglobin (HGB), blood urea nitrogen (BUN), red blood cell volume 
distribution width (RDW), creatinine (CRE), congestive heart failure, myocardial 
infarction, sodium, and blood transfusion. The external validation in eICU-CRD 
demonstrated that adapting boosting (Ada) model had the highest AUC of 0.924 
(95% CI: 0.902-0.943). Furthermore, in the DCA curve, the Ada model and the 
extreme Gradient Boosting (XGB) model had relatively higher net benefits (ie, 
the correct classification of coagulopathy considering a trade-off between 
false- negatives and false-positives)-over other models across a range of 
threshold probability values. Conclusions: The ML models, as indicated by our 
study, can be used to predict the incidence of TBI-IC in the intensive care unit 
(ICU).

Background: Serum bilirubin level has been suggested to be associated with 
mortality for patients with severe sepsis. This study aimed to investigate the 
association of serum total bilirubin level with hospital mortality rate in adult 
critically ill patients. Method: Data were extracted from the Medical 
Information Mart for Intensive Care-III (MIMIC-III) database. Patients with 
measured serum total bilirubin levels that recorded within 24 h after admission 
were involved in this study. Association of serum total bilirubin level and 
hospital mortality rate was assessed using logistic regression analysis. 
Propensity score-matching (PSM) was used to minimize differences between 
different groups. Results: A total of 12,035 critically ill patients were herein 
involved. In patients with serum total bilirubin level ≥ 2 mg/dL, the hospital 
mortality rate was 31.9% compared with 17.0% for patients with serum total 
bilirubin level < 2 mg/dL (546/1714 vs. 1750/10321, P < 0.001). The results of 
multivariable logistic regression analysis showed that the odds ratio of 
mortality in patients with serum total bilirubin level ≥ 2 mg/dL was 1.654 [95% 
confidence interval (CI): 1.307, 2.093, P < 0.001]. After propensity score 
matching, in patients with serum total bilirubin level ≥ 2 mg/dL, the weighted 
hospital mortality rate was 32.2% compared with 24.8% for patients with serum 
total bilirubin level < 2 mg/dL, P = 0.001). Conclusions: Serum total bilirubin 
concentration was found to be independently associated with hospital mortality 
rate in adult critically ill patients.

The purpose is to analyze the prevalence of intestinal infection in patients 
with pneumonia in intensive care units (ICU) and the impact of intestinal 
infection on the prognosis of patients with pneumonia, so as to explore the 
bidirectional association between pneumonia and intestinal infection. The study 
aims to investigate the correlation between the occurrence of pneumonia and 
intestinal infection among patients in the ICU, utilizing the Medical 
Information Mart for Intensive Care IV (MIMIC-IV) database, as well as the 
impact of intestinal infection on the prognosis of pneumonia patients. The 
enrolled patients were first divided into pneumonia group and non-pneumonia 
group, and the primary outcome was that patients developed intestinal infection. 
Multivariate logistic regression was used to elucidate the association between 
pneumonia and the prevalence of intestinal infection, and propensity score 
matching (PSM) and inverse probability of treatment weighing (IPTW) were used to 
validate our findings. We then divided patients with pneumonia into two groups 
according to whether they were complicated by intestinal infection, and analyzed 
the effect of intestinal infection on 28-day mortality, length of ICU stay, and 
length of hospital stay in patients with pneumonia. This study included 50,920 
patients, of which 7493 were diagnosed with pneumonia. Compared with 
non-pneumonia patients, the incidence of intestinal infection in pneumonia 
patients was significantly increased [OR 1.58 (95% CI 1.34-1.85; P < 0.001)]. 
Cox proportional hazards regression model showed no significant effect of 
co-infection on 28-day mortality in patients with pneumonia (P = 0.223). 
Patients in the intestinal infection group exhibited a longer length stay in ICU 
and hospital than those without intestinal infection (P < 0.001). In the ICU, 
patients with pneumonia were more likely linked to intestinal infection. In 
addition, the presence of concurrent intestinal infections can prolong both ICU 
and hospital stays for pneumonia patients.

OBJECTIVE: Recent advances in deep learning show significant potential in 
analyzing continuous monitoring electronic health records (EHR) data for 
clinical outcome prediction. We aim to develop a Transformer-based, 
Encounter-level Clinical Outcome (TECO) model to predict mortality in the 
intensive care unit (ICU) using inpatient EHR data.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: TECO was developed using multiple baseline and 
time-dependent clinical variables from 2579 hospitalized COVID-19 patients to 
predict ICU mortality, and was validated externally in an ARDS cohort (n=2799) 
and a sepsis cohort (n=6622) from the Medical Information Mart for Intensive 
Care (MIMIC)-IV. Model performance was evaluated based on area under the 
receiver operating characteristic (AUC) and compared with Epic Deterioration 
Index (EDI), random forest (RF), and extreme gradient boosting (XGBoost).
RESULTS: In the COVID-19 development dataset, TECO achieved higher AUC 
(0.89-0.97) across various time intervals compared to EDI (0.86-0.95), RF 
(0.87-0.96), and XGBoost (0.88-0.96). In the two MIMIC testing datasets (EDI not 
available), TECO yielded higher AUC (0.65-0.76) than RF (0.57-0.73) and XGBoost 
(0.57-0.73). In addition, TECO was able to identify clinically interpretable 
features that were correlated with the outcome.
DISCUSSION: TECO outperformed proprietary metrics and conventional machine 
learning models in predicting ICU mortality among COVID-19 and non-COVID-19 
patients.
CONCLUSIONS: TECO demonstrates a strong capability for predicting ICU mortality 
using continuous monitoring data. While further validation is needed, TECO has 
the potential to serve as a powerful early warning tool across various diseases 
in inpatient settings.

OBJECTIVE: Within this study we attempt to express a correlation between the 
mortality of stroke and stroke related infection to a novel biomarker 
represented by the red blood cell width-albumin levels ratio within the patient. 
We hypothesize that this novel biomarker could be utilized as better predictive 
tool for stroke associated infections.
METHODS: Patient data sets were obtained via the Medical Information Mart for 
Intensive Care Database iii V1.4 (MIMIC-iii). Data from 1480 patients were 
obtained to serve the testing for the RA biomarker tests. Clinical endpoints of 
30-, 60-, and 365-day all-cause mortality in stroke patients were used as 
subgroups within the analyzed population. Estimation of hazard ratios (HR) were 
obtained from Cox regression models for stroke-associated infection and 
all-cause mortality in relation to RA values.
RESULTS: A high-RA was associated with increased mortality in ICU patients 
suffering from a stroke. After adjusting for age and sex, compared to the 
reference group (the first quartile), the high-RA group had the highest 30-day 
(HR, 95% CI: 1.88 (1.36, 2.58)), 90-day (HR, 95% CI: 2.12 (1.59, 2.82)), and 
one-year (HR, 95% CI: 2.15 (1.65, 2.80)) all-cause mortality. The RA values were 
independently associated with an increased risk of stroke-associated infection 
when adjusting for confounders.
CONCLUSIONS: Our data suggest RA may be an easily accessible, reproducible, and 
low-cost biomarker for predicting stroke-associated infections and mortality in 
patients who have suffered from a stroke.

BACKGROUND: Multidrug-resistant organisms (MDRO) pose a significant threat to 
public health. Intensive Care Units (ICU), characterized by the extensive use of 
antimicrobial agents and a high prevalence of bacterial resistance, are hotspots 
for MDRO proliferation. Timely identification of patients at high risk for MDRO 
can aid in curbing transmission, enhancing patient outcomes, and maintaining the 
cleanliness of the ICU environment. This study focused on developing a machine 
learning (ML) model to identify patients at risk of MDRO during the initial 
phase of their ICU stay.
METHODS: Utilizing patient data from the First Medical Center of the People's 
Liberation Army General Hospital (PLAGH-ICU) and the Medical Information Mart 
for Intensive Care (MIMIC-IV), the study analyzed variables within 24 h of ICU 
admission. Machine learning algorithms were applied to these datasets, 
emphasizing the early detection of MDRO colonization or infection. Model 
efficacy was evaluated by the area under the receiver operating characteristics 
curve (AUROC), alongside internal and external validation sets.
RESULTS: The study evaluated 3,536 patients in PLAGH-ICU and 34,923 in MIMIC-IV, 
revealing MDRO prevalence of 11.96% and 8.81%, respectively. Significant 
differences in ICU and hospital stays, along with mortality rates, were observed 
between MDRO positive and negative patients. In the temporal validation, the 
PLAGH-ICU model achieved an AUROC of 0.786 [0.748, 0.825], while the MIMIC-IV 
model reached 0.744 [0.723, 0.766]. External validation demonstrated reduced 
model performance across different datasets. Key predictors included biochemical 
markers and the duration of pre-ICU hospital stay.
CONCLUSIONS: The ML models developed in this study demonstrated their capability 
in early identification of MDRO risks in ICU patients. Continuous refinement and 
validation in varied clinical contexts remain essential for future applications.

BACKGROUND: Hepatic encephalopathy (HE) is associated with marked increases in 
morbidity and mortality for cirrhosis patients. This study aimed to develop and 
validate machine learning (ML) models to predict 28-day mortality for patients 
with HE.
METHODS: A retrospective cohort study was conducted in the Medical Information 
Mart for Intensive Care (MIMIC)-IV database. Patients from MIMIC-IV were 
randomized into training and validation cohorts in a ratio of 7:3. Training 
cohort was used for establishing the model while validation cohort was used for 
validation. The outcome was defined as 28-day mortality. Predictors were 
identified by recursive feature elimination (RFE) within 24 h of intensive care 
unit (ICU) admission. The area under the curve (AUC) and calibration curve were 
used to determine the predictive performance of different ML models.
RESULTS: In the MIMIC-IV database, 601 patients were eventually diagnosed with 
HE. Of these, 112 (18.64%) experienced death within 28 days. Acute physiology 
score III (APSIII), sepsis related organ failure assessment (SOFA), 
international normalized ratio (INR), total bilirubin (TBIL), albumin, blood 
urea nitrogen (BUN), acute kidney injury (AKI) and mechanical ventilation were 
identified as independent risk factors. Validation set indicated that the 
artificial neural network (NNET) model had the highest AUC of 0.837 (95% 
CI:0.774-0.901). Furthermore, in the calibration curve, the NNET model was also 
well-calibrated (P = 0.323), which means that it can better predict the 28-day 
mortality in HE patients. Additionally, the performance of the NNET is superior 
to existing scores, including Model for End-Stage Liver Disease (MELD) and Model 
for End-Stage Liver Disease-Sodium (MELD-Na).
CONCLUSIONS: In this study, the NNET model demonstrated better discrimination in 
predicting 28-day mortality as compared to other models. This developed model 
could potentially improve the early detection of HE with high mortality, 
subsequently improving clinical outcomes in these patients with HE, but further 
external prospective validation is still required.

OBJECTIVE: This study aims to construct and compare four machine learning models 
using the MIMIC-IV database to identify high-risk factors for 
multidrug-resistant organism (MDRO) infection in Ventilator-associated pneumonia 
(VAP) patients.
METHODS: The study included 972 VAP patients from the MIMIC-IV database. Data 
encompassing demographic information, vital signs, laboratory results, and other 
relevant variables were collected. The class imbalance issue was addressed using 
the Synthetic Minority Over-sampling Technique (SMOTE). The dataset was randomly 
split into training and testing sets (8:2). LASSO regression and feature 
importance scores were used for feature selection. Clinical prediction models 
were built using logistic regression, XGBoost, random forest and gradient 
boosting machine. The performance of the models was evaluated through receiver 
operating characteristic(ROC) curve analysis.Model calibration was assessed 
using calibration curves and Brier scores. The effectiveness was evaluated 
through Decision Curve Analysis (DCA). SHAP was utilized for model 
interpretation.
RESULTS: Among 972 patients, 824 were non-MDROs-VAP and 128 were MDROs-VAP. 
Comparative analysis revealed statistically significant differences in various 
clinical parameters. XGBoost exhibited the best predictive performance, 
incorporating 20 features with an AUC of 0.831 (95 % CI: 0.785-0.877) on the 
test set. Calibration curves demonstrated robust consistency, corroborated by 
Decision Curve Analysis (DCA) affirming the clinical utility. SHAP analysis 
identified the most important features: red cell distribution width, duration of 
mechanical ventilation, anion gap, basophil percentage, and neutrophil 
percentage.
CONCLUSION: This study established and compared four machine learning models for 
MDROs infections in VAP patients. XGBoost was identified as the optimal 
predictor, and SHAP values provided insights into 20 independent risk factors, 
confirming its excellent predictive value.
IMPLICATIONS FOR CLINICAL PRACTICE: VAP is a common infection in ICU patients 
with a heightened risk of MDRO and increased mortality. The recognition of high 
bias in existing models calls for future research to employ rigorous 
methodologies and robust data sources, aiming to develop and validate more 
accurate and clinically applicable predictive models for MDROs infections in VAP 
patients.

The relationship between body temperature changes and prognosis in patients with 
acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) remains inconclusive. Our study aimed 
to investigate the clinical value of body temperature in the management of ARDS. 
Data from the Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care III database were 
collected. Adult patients with ARDS were enrolled and further grouped based on 
their temperature values in the intensive care unit. Both the maximum 
(temperaturemax) and minimum (temperaturemin) temperatures were used. The 
primary outcome was 28-day mortality rate. Polynomial regression, subgroup 
analysis, and logistic regression analysis were performed in the final analysis. 
A total of 3922 patients with ARDS were enrolled. There was a U-shaped 
relationship between 28-day mortality and body temperature. For patients with 
infection, the elevated temperaturemax (≥37.0°C) was associated with decreased 
mortality, with an odds ratio ranging from 0.39 to 0.49, using temperaturemax 
from 36.5°C to 36.9°C as reference. For patients without infection, a similar 
tendency was observed, but the protective effect was lost at extremely high 
temperatures (≥38.0°C, p < 0.05). Elevated temperaturemin (≥37.0°C) and 
decreased temperaturemin (<35.0°C) were associated with increased mortality, 
using the temperaturemin from 36.0°C to 36.9°C as a reference. Hypothermia was 
associated with increased mortality in patients with ARDS, while the effect of 
hyperthermia (≥37.0°C) on the mortality of patients with ARDS was not fully 
consistent in the infection and noninfection subgroups. Short-term and transient 
temperatures above 37.0°C would be beneficial to patients with ARDS, but extreme 
hyperthermia and persistent temperatures above 37.0°C should be avoided.

BACKGROUND: This study aimed to develop a higher performance nomogram based on 
explainable machine learning methods, and to predict the risk of death of stroke 
patients within 30 days based on clinical characteristics on the first day of 
intensive care units (ICU) admission.
METHODS: Data relating to stroke patients were extracted from the Medical 
Information Marketplace of the Intensive Care (MIMIC) IV and III database. The 
LightGBM machine learning approach together with Shapely additive explanations 
(termed as explain machine learning, EML) was used to select clinical features 
and define cut-off points for the selected features. These selected features and 
cut-off points were then evaluated using the Cox proportional hazards regression 
model and Kaplan-Meier survival curves. Finally, logistic regression-based 
nomograms for predicting 30-day mortality of stroke patients were constructed 
using original variables and variables dichotomized by cut-off points, 
respectively. The performance of two nomograms were evaluated in overall and 
individual dimension.
RESULTS: A total of 2982 stroke patients and 64 clinical features were included, 
and the 30-day mortality rate was 23.6% in the MIMIC-IV datasets. 10 variables 
("sofa (sepsis-related organ failure assessment)", "minimum glucose", "maximum 
sodium", "age", "mean spo2 (blood oxygen saturation)", "maximum temperature", 
"maximum heart rate", "minimum bun (blood urea nitrogen)", "minimum wbc (white 
blood cells)" and "charlson comorbidity index") and respective cut-off points 
were defined from the EML. In the Cox proportional hazards regression model (Cox 
regression) and Kaplan-Meier survival curves, after grouping stroke patients 
according to the cut-off point of each variable, patients belonging to the 
high-risk subgroup were associated with higher 30-day mortality than those in 
the low-risk subgroup. The evaluation of nomograms found that the EML-based 
nomogram not only outperformed the conventional nomogram in NIR (net 
reclassification index), brier score and clinical net benefits in overall 
dimension, but also significant improved in individual dimension especially for 
low "maximum temperature" patients.
CONCLUSIONS: The 10 selected first-day ICU admission clinical features require 
greater attention for stroke patients. And the nomogram based on explainable 
machine learning will have greater clinical application.

The blood urea nitrogen to albumin ratio (BAR) has been demonstrated as a 
prognostic factor in sepsis and respiratory diseases, yet its role in severe 
coronary heart disease (CHD) remains unexplored. This retrospective study, 
utilizing data from the Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care-IV database, 
included 4254 CHD patients, predominantly male (63.54%), with a median age of 
74 years (IQR 64-83). Primary outcomes included in-hospital, 28-day and 1-year 
all-cause mortality after ICU admission. The Kaplan-Meier curves, Cox regression 
analysis, multivariable restricted cubic spline regression were employed to 
assess association between BAR index and mortality. In-hospital, within 28-day 
and 1-year mortality rates were 16.93%, 20.76% and 38.11%, respectively. 
Multivariable Cox proportional hazards analysis revealed associations between 
the increased BAR index and higher in-hospital mortality (HR 1.11, 95% CI 
1.02-1.21), 28-day mortality (HR 1.17, 95% CI 1.08-1.27) and 1-year mortality 
(HR 1.23, 95% CI 1.16-1.31). Non-linear relationships were observed for 28-day 
and 1-year mortality with increasing BAR index (both P for 
non-linearity < 0.05). Elevated BAR index was a predictor for mortality in ICU 
patients with CHD, offering potential value for early high-risk patient 
identification and proactive management by clinicians.

The present study aimed to explore the association between the 
neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio (NLR) and prognosis of critically ill chronic 
heart failure patients. The records of 5298 patients who met the inclusion 
criteria were extracted from the Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care IV 
database. The primary outcome was 30-days all-cause mortality and the secondary 
outcome was 90-days all-cause mortality. Multivariable logistic regression 
analysis was performed to examine the relationship between NLR and 30-days 
mortality. Subgroup analysis was carried out to identify whether the association 
between NLR and 30-days mortality differed across various subgroups. For 30-days 
mortality, after adjusting for multiple confounders, the odds ratio (OR) (95% 
confidence interval [CI]) for the second (NLR 4.0-8.4) and the third (NLR ≥8.4) 
tertiles were 1.52 (1.13-2.03) and 2.53 (1.92-3.34), respectively, compared with 
the first tertile (NLR <4.0). As for 90-days mortality, the OR for the second 
(NLR 4.0-8.4) was 1.34 (1.07-1.67) and 2.23 (1.81-2.76) for the third (NLR ≥8.4) 
tertiles compared with the reference (NLR<4.0). The interactions between the 
sepsis subgroup and 30-days mortality were significant. Our study concluded that 
the NLR was an independent predictor of 30- and 90-days mortality for critically 
ill patients with chronic heart failure.

BACKGROUND: Acute pancreatitis (AP) is a common gastrointestinal disease in 
which infection is a serious complication. Understanding its bacterial spectrum 
and antibiotic resistance is of great significance for treatment.
OBJECTIVE: This retrospective study analyzed the Medical Information Mart for 
Intensive Care database with the aim of identifying the distribution 
characteristics of pathogenic bacteria in AP patients.
METHODS: First, 2089 AP patients were classified and analyzed statistically 
according to culture results. Second, the bacterial profile, antibiotic 
resistance, and antibiotic-use data of positive culture group were analyzed. 
Third, logistic regression analysis was used to identify the rick factors of 
culture results, and culture results correlations with mortality.
RESULTS: This study included 1486 patients in negative culture group, 603 
patients in positive cultures. Enterococcus spp. (71%), Enterococcus faecium 
(61%), and Staphylococcus aureus coagulase-positive (54%) exhibited the highest 
proportions of drug resistance. Logistic regression revealed five factors 
related to positive culture (the number of antibiotics, length of stay in 
hospital, length of stay in intensive care unit, mechanical ventilation, and 
parenteral nutrition) and four factors related to distribution of 
multidrug-resistant bacterial infection (age, hemoglobin, length of stay in 
hospital, and duration on antibiotics).
CONCLUSIONS: This study found that enteric bacteria were the most common source 
of infection (26.7%). Carbapenems, penicillins containing enzyme inhibitors, 
fifth-generation cephalosporins, oxazolidinones, and some of the aminoglycoside 
antibiotics had high sensitivity, which can guide the use of clinical empiric 
antibiotics. Positive culture was an independent risk factor for in-hospital 
all-cause mortality of AP patients.

OBJECTIVES: This study aimed to determine the relationship between the body mass 
index (BMI) and short-term mortality of patients with intra-abdominal infection 
(IAI) using the Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care (MIMIC-III) 
database.
DESIGN: Retrospective cohort study.
SETTING: Adult intensive care units (ICUs) at a tertiary hospital in the USA .
PARTICIPANTS: Adult IAI ICU patients from 2001 to 2012 in the MIMIC-III 
database.
INTERVENTIONS: In univariate analysis, we compared the differences in the 
characteristics of patients in each BMI group. Cox regression models were used 
to evaluate the relationships between BMI and short-term prognosis.
PRIMARY AND SECONDARY OUTCOME MEASURES: 90-day survival.
RESULTS: In total, 1161 patients with IAI were included. There were 399 (34.4%) 
patients with a normal BMI (<25 kg/m2), 357 (30.8%) overweight patients 
(25-30 kg/m2) and 405 (34.9%) obese patients (>30 kg/m2) who tended to be 
younger (p<0.001) and had higher Sequential Organ Failure Assessment scores 
(p<0.05). The mortality of obese patients at 90 days was lower than that of 
patients with a normal BMI (20.74% vs 23.25%, p<0.05), but their length of stay 
in the ICU was higher (4.9 days vs 3.6 days, p<0.001); however, their rate of 
mechanical ventilation utilisation was higher (61.48% vs 56.86%, p<0.05). In the 
Cox regression model, we also confirmed that BMI was a protective factor in 
patients with IAIs, and the adjusted mortality rate of patients with a higher 
BMI was 0.97 times lower than that of patients with a lower BMI (p<0.001, 
HR=0.97, 95% CI 0.96 to 0.99).
CONCLUSIONS: IAI patients with an overweight or obese status might have lower 
90-day mortality than patients with a normal BMI.

Osmotic therapy has been recognized as an important treatment option for 
patients with traumatic brain injury (TBI). Nevertheless, the effect of 
hypertonic saline (HTS) remains unknown, as findings are primarily based on a 
large database. This study aimed to elucidate the effect of HTS on the clinical 
outcomes of patients with TBI admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU). We 
retrospectively identified patients with moderate-to-severe TBI from two public 
databases: Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care (MIMIC)-IV and eICU 
Collaborative Research Database (eICU-CRD). A marginal structural Cox model 
(MSCM) was used, with time-dependent variates designed to reflect exposure over 
time during ICU stay. Trajectory modeling based on the intracranial pressure 
evolution pattern allowed for the identification of subgroups. Overall, 130 
(6.65%) of 1955 eligible patients underwent HTS. MSCM indicated that the HTS 
significantly associated with higher infection complications (e.g., urinary 
tract infection (HR 1.88, 95% CI 1.26-2.81, p = 0.002)) and increased ICU LOS 
(HR 2.02, 95% CI 1.71-2.40, p < 0.001). A protective effect of HTS on GCS was 
found in subgroups with medium and low intracranial pressure. Our study revealed 
no significant difference in mortality between patients who underwent HTS and 
those who did not. Increased occurrence rates of infection and electrolyte 
imbalance are inevitable outcomes of continuous HTS infusion. Although the study 
suggests slight beneficial effects, including better neurological outcomes, 
these results warrant further validation.

Background: Sepsis, as one of the severe diseases, is frequently observed in 
critically ill patients, especially concurrent with diabetes. Whether admission 
blood glucose is associated with the prognosis, and outcome of septic patients 
is still debatable. Methods: We retrospectively reviewed and analyzed the 
demographic characteristics of septic patients in the Medical Information Mart 
for Intensive Care III (MIMIC III, version 1.4) between June 2001 and October 
2012. The Chi-square and Fisher's exact tests were used for the comparison of 
qualitative variables among septic patients with different glucose levels and 
the 30-day mortality in septic patients with diabetes or not. Univariate and 
stepwise multivariate Cox regression analyses were used to determine the risk 
factors for 30-day mortality. Kaplan-Meier analysis was conducted to reveal the 
different 30-day survival probabilities in each subgroup. Results: A total of 
2,948 septic patients (910 cases with diabetes, 2,038 cases without diabetes) 
were ultimately included in the study. The 30-day mortality was 32.4% (956/2,948 
cases) in the overall population without any difference among diabetic and 
non-diabetic septic patients (p = 1.000). Admission blood glucose levels <70 
mg/dl were only observed to be significantly associated with the 30-day 
mortality of septic patients without diabetes (hazard ratio (HR) = 2.48, p < 
0.001). After adjusting for confounders, age >65 years (HR = 1.53, p = 0.001), 
the Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (SOFA) score >5 (HR = 2.26, p < 0.001), 
lactic acid >2 mmol/L (Lac, HR = 1.35, p = 0.024), and platelet abnormality 
(<100 k/ul: HR = 1.49; >300 k/ul: HR = 1.36, p < 0.001) were the independent 
risk factors for 30-day mortality in septic patients with diabetes. In 
non-diabetes population, age >65 years (HR = 1.53, p < 0.001), non-White or 
non-Black patients (HR = 1.30, p = 0.004), SOFA score >5 (HR = 1.56, p < 0.001), 
blood glucose <70 mg/dl (HR = 1.91, p = 0.003), anion gap (AG) >2 mmol/L (HR = 
1.60, p < 0.001), Lac (HR = 1.61, p < 0.001), urea nitrogen >21 mg/dl (HR = 
1.45, p = 0.001), alanine aminotransferase (ALT, HR = 1.31, p = 0.009), total 
bilirubin >1.2 mg/dl (HR = 1.20, p = 0.033), and low hemoglobin (HR = 1.34, p = 
0.001) were the independent risk factors for 30-day mortality. Conclusions: Our 
results indicate admission blood glucose, especially in terms of <70 mg/dl, is 
the key signaling in predicting the worse 30-day survival probability of septic 
patients without diabetes, which could help clinicians to make a more suitable 
and precise treatment modality in dealing with septic patients.

Medical University, Beijing, China.

PURPOSE: This study aims to develop and validate a nomogram for predicting the 
risk of bloodstream infections (BSI) in critically ill patients based on their 
admission status to the Intensive Care Unit (ICU).
PATIENTS AND METHODS: Patients' data were extracted from the Medical Information 
Mart for Intensive Care-IV (MIMIC-IV) database (training set), the Beijing 
Friendship Hospital (BFH) database (validation set) and the eICU Collaborative 
Research Database (eICU-CRD) (validation set). Univariate logistic regression 
analyses were used to analyze the influencing factors, and lasso regression was 
used to select the predictive factors. Model performance was assessed using area 
under receiver operating characteristic curve (AUROC) and Presented as a 
Nomogram. Various aspects of the established predictive nomogram were evaluated, 
including discrimination, calibration, and clinical utility.
RESULTS: The model dataset consisted of 14930 patients (1444 BSI patients) from 
the MIMIC-IV database, divided into the training and internal validation 
datasets in a 7:3 ratio. The eICU dataset included 2100 patients (100 with BSI) 
as the eICU validation dataset, and the BFH dataset included 419 patients (21 
with BSI) as the BFH validation dataset. The nomogram was constructed based on 
Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS), sepsis related organ failure assessment (SOFA) score, 
temperature, heart rate, respiratory rate, white blood cell (WBC), red width of 
distribution (RDW), renal replacement therapy and presence of liver disease on 
their admission status to the ICU. The AUROCs were 0.83 (CI 95%:0.81-0.84) in 
the training dataset, 0.88 (CI 95%:0.88-0.96) in the BFH validation dataset, and 
0.75 (95%CI 0.70-0.79) in the eICU validation dataset. The clinical effect curve 
and decision curve showed that most areas of the decision curve of this model 
were greater than 0, indicating that this model has a certain clinical 
effectiveness.
CONCLUSION: The nomogram developed in this study provides a valuable tool for 
clinicians and nurses to assess individual risk, enabling them to identify 
patients at a high risk of bloodstream infections in the ICU.

OBJECTIVES: Recent advances in deep learning show significant potential in 
analyzing continuous monitoring electronic health records (EHR) data for 
clinical outcome prediction. We aim to develop a Transformer-based, 
Encounter-level Clinical Outcome (TECO) model to predict mortality in the 
intensive care unit (ICU) using inpatient EHR data.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: The TECO model was developed using multiple baseline and 
time-dependent clinical variables from 2579 hospitalized COVID-19 patients to 
predict ICU mortality and was validated externally in an acute respiratory 
distress syndrome cohort (n = 2799) and a sepsis cohort (n = 6622) from the 
Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care IV (MIMIC-IV). Model performance was 
evaluated based on the area under the receiver operating characteristic (AUC) 
and compared with Epic Deterioration Index (EDI), random forest (RF), and 
extreme gradient boosting (XGBoost).
RESULTS: In the COVID-19 development dataset, TECO achieved higher AUC 
(0.89-0.97) across various time intervals compared to EDI (0.86-0.95), RF 
(0.87-0.96), and XGBoost (0.88-0.96). In the 2 MIMIC testing datasets (EDI not 
available), TECO yielded higher AUC (0.65-0.77) than RF (0.59-0.75) and XGBoost 
(0.59-0.74). In addition, TECO was able to identify clinically interpretable 
features that were correlated with the outcome.
DISCUSSION: The TECO model outperformed proprietary metrics and conventional 
machine learning models in predicting ICU mortality among patients with 
COVID-19, widespread inflammation, respiratory illness, and other organ 
failures.
CONCLUSION: The TECO model demonstrates a strong capability for predicting ICU 
mortality using continuous monitoring data. While further validation is needed, 
TECO has the potential to serve as a powerful early warning tool across various 
diseases in inpatient settings.

BACKGROUND: Serum anion gap (AG) can potentially be applied to the diagnosis of 
various metabolic acidosis, and a recent study has reported the association of 
AG with the mortality of patients with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). 
However, the relationship of AG with the short-term mortality of patients with 
ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) is still unclear. Herein, we aimed to 
investigate the association between AG and the 30-day mortality of VAP patients, 
and construct and assess a multivariate predictive model for the 30-day 
mortality risk of VAP.
METHODS: This retrospective cohort study extracted data of 477 patients with VAP 
from the Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care III (MIMIC-III) database. 
Data of patients were divided into a training set and a testing set with a ratio 
of 7:3. In the training set, variables significantly associated with the 30-day 
mortality of VAP patients were included in the multivariate predictive model 
through univariate Cox regression and stepwise regression analyses. Then, the 
predictive performance of the multivariate predictive model was assessed in both 
training set and testing set, and compared with the single AG and other scoring 
systems including the Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (SOFA) score, the 
confusion, urea, respiratory rate (RR), blood pressure, and age (≥65 years old) 
(CURB-65) score, and the blood urea nitrogen (BUN), altered mental status, 
pulse, and age (>65 years old) (BAP-65) score. In addition, the association of 
AG with the 30-day mortality of VAP patients was explored in subgroups of 
gender, age, and infection status. The evaluation indexes were hazard ratios 
(HRs), C-index, and 95% confidence intervals (CIs).
RESULTS: A total of 70 patients died within 30 days. The multivariate predictive 
model consisted of AG (HR =1.052, 95% CI: 1.008-1.098), age (HR =1.037, 95% CI: 
1.019-1.055), duration of mechanical ventilation (HR =0.998, 95% CI: 
0.996-0.999), and vasopressors use (HR =1.795, 95% CI: 1.066-3.023). In both 
training set (C-index =0.725, 95% CI: 0.670-0.780) and testing set (C-index 
=0.717, 95% CI: 0.637-0.797), the multivariate model had a relatively superior 
predictive performance to the single AG value. Moreover, the association of AG 
with the 30-day mortality was also found in patients who were male (HR =1.088, 
95% CI: 1.029-1.150), and whatever the pathogens they infected (bacterial 
infection: HR =1.059, 95% CI: 1.011-1.109; fungal infection: HR =1.057, 95% CI: 
1.002-1.115).
CONCLUSIONS: The AG-related multivariate model had a potential predictive value 
for the 30-day mortality of patients with VAP. These findings may provide some 
references for further exploration on simple and robust predictors of the 
short-term mortality risk of VAP, which may further help clinicians to identify 
patients with high risk of mortality in an early stage in the intensive care 
units (ICUs).

BACKGROUND: Calcium administration in septic patients with hypocalcemia is a 
controversial issue. The present study preliminarily investigated the effects of 
calcium supplementation on the length of hospitalization and mortality in septic 
ICU patients with different severities of hypocalcemia and disease.
METHOD: A total of 5761 eligible septic patients, including 2689 who received 
calcium supplementation and 3072 who did not receive calcium supplementation, 
were extracted from the Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care III 
(MIMIC-III) database. The cofounding covariates between the calcium supplement 
and nonsupplement groups were balanced using the propensity score matching 
model. We compared the length of stay (LOS) in the ICU and hospital with 28-day 
and hospital mortality and stratified the analysis according to the sequential 
organ failure assessment (SOFA) score and ionized calcium (iCa) at the first ICU 
admission in the matched groups.
RESULTS: The results showed that iCa at the first ICU admission was associated 
with mortality in sepsis patients (HR: 0.421; 95% CI: 0.211∼0.837), but the 
lowest mortality rate was observed in patients with mild hypocalcemia. A total 
of 993 paired patients were included in the analysis after propensity score 
matching. Regardless of the SOFA score or presence of iCa, the LOS in the ICU 
was higher in the calcium supplement group than in the nonsupplement group. The 
survival analysis was stratified by the SOFA score and showed that calcium 
supplementation reduced mortality when the patient's SOFA score was ≥8 
(p=0.002), and it worsened the outcome when the patient's SOFA score was ≤4 
(p=0.010). It had no significant effect on patients with SOFA scores ranging 
from 5 to 7 (p=0.911).
CONCLUSION: Our results showed that mild hypocalcemia may be protective in 
septic patients, and calcium supplementation may have positive and negative 
effects on mortality depending on disease severity. The SOFA score may be a 
valuable clinical index for decisions regarding calcium administration.

BACKGROUND: Carbapenem-resistant microorganism (CRO) transmission in the medical 
setting confers a global threat to public health. However, there is no 
established risk prediction model for infection due to CRO in ICU patients. This 
study aimed to develop a nomogram to predict the risk of acquiring CRO infection 
in patients with the first ICU admission and to determine the length of ICU stay 
(ICU-LOS) and 28-day survival.
METHODS: Patient data were retrieved from the Medical Information Mart for 
Intensive Care (MIMIC-IV) database based on predetermined inclusion and 
exclusion criteria. A CRO was defined as a bacterium isolated from any humoral 
microbial culture that showed insensitivity or resistance to carbapenems. The 
characteristics of CRO and non-CRO patients in the first ICU admission were 
compared. Propensity score matching was applied to balance the differences 
between the CRO and non-CRO cohorts. Kaplan-Meier curves were constructed to 
determine the 28-day survival rate and ICU-LOS. Furthermore, after randomization 
of the CRO cohort into the training and validation sets, a predictive nomogram 
was constructed based on LASSO regression and Logistic regression analysis, and 
its performance was verified by internal validation.
RESULTS: Overall, 4531 patients who had first ICU admission as recorded in 
MIMIC-IV were enrolled, 183 (4.04%) of whom were diagnosed with CRO infection. 
Moreover, CRO infection was independently associated with 28-day survival and 
ICU-LOS in ICU patients. Parameters eligible for inclusion in this nomogram were 
male sex, hemoglobin-min, temperature-max, use of a peripherally inserted 
central catheter line, dialysis treatment, and use of carbapenems. This nomogram 
showed a better performance as indicated by the area under the receiver 
operating characteristic curve values of 0.776 (95% confidence interval [CI] 
0.667-0.750) and 0.723 (95% CI 0.556-0.855) in the training and validation sets, 
respectively, in terms of predicting the risk of acquiring CRO infection.
CONCLUSIONS: CRO infection was independently associated with ICU-LOS and 28-day 
survival in patients with first ICU admission. The nomogram showed the best 
prediction of the risk of acquiring CRO infection in ICU patients. Based on the 
nomogram-based scoring, we can management the risk factors and guide 
individualized prevention and control of CRO.

OBJECTIVE: To compare the accuracy of serum lactate parameters, including 
lactate peak concentration (LACpeak), lactate time area (LACarea), and lactate 
clearance (LC) for predicting mortality of the septic patients, and to compare 
with the predictive accuracy of National Early Warning Score (NEWS) and 
Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (SOFA) scores.
METHODS: This study retrospectively screened the septic patients admitted to the 
ICU in the Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care IV (MIMIC-IV) from 2008 
to 2019. The baseline data and outcomes of patients were gathered. The subjects 
were divided into the non-survival group and the survival group. SOFA, NEWS, 
LACpeak, and LACarea were recorded. The LC was calculated 6 h after LACpeak. The 
above parameters were compared by the T-test and Mann-Whitney U test, and odds 
ratios were calculated adjusting for age and sex. The receiver operating 
characteristic curves (ROCs) of subjects were plotted according to SOFA, NEWS, 
LACpeak, and LACarea within 24h, and LC at 6h of ICU admission. The Areas under 
the ROC curve (AUCs), sensitivity, and specificity were compared with R version 
4.1.1.
RESULTS: 1,169 septic patients were involved, and 366 (31.3%) patients died 
within 28 days. Compared to the survival group, the LACpeak of the non-survival 
group was higher [4.85 (3.2, 7.9) vs. 3.4 (2.6, 5.25) mmol/L, adjusted odds 
ratio 1.18, P < 0.001], and the LACarea of the non-survivals was higher than the 
survivals too [18.44 (10.36, 27.63) vs. 13.65 (9.01, 21.73), adjusted odds ratio 
1.03, P < 0.001)]. The LC of the survivals at 6 h after LACpeak was 
significantly higher than that of the non-survivals [0.26 (0.14.0.42) vs. 0.19 
(0.10, 0.33), adjusted odds ratio 0.06, P < 0.01]. Within 24h of ICU admission, 
the AUCs of mortality prediction in descending order were NEWS [0.73 (0.70, 
0.76)], SOFA [0.69 (0.66, 0.73)], LACpeak [0.64 (0.61, 0.68)], and LACarea [0.60 
(0.56, 0.63)]. There were 204 patients with 6-hour LC after LACpeak the AUCs of 
LACarea, LACpeak and LC were 0.73(0.65, 0.80), 0.71(0.62,0.78) and 0.65 (0.56, 
0.73), respectively.
CONCLUSIONS: The predictive accuracy of LC was not superior to LACpeak and 
LACarea for the mortality of the septic patients and the predictive value of all 
the above lactate parameters for mortality maybe not better than SOFA and NEWS.

Background: It is unclear if the addition of antifungal therapy for perforated 
peptic ulcers (PPU) leads to improved outcomes. We hypothesized that empiric 
antifungal therapy is associated with better clinical outcomes in critically ill 
patients with PPU. Patients and Methods: The 2001-2012 Medical Information Mart 
for Intensive Care (MIMIC-III) database was searched for patients with PPU and 
the included subjects were divided into two groups depending on receipt of 
antifungal therapy. Propensity score matching by surgical intervention, 
mechanical ventilation (MV), and vasopressor administration was then performed 
and clinically important outcomes were compared. Multiple logistic regression 
was performed to calculate the odds of a composite end point (defined as "alive, 
hospital-free, and infection-free at 30 days"). Results: A total of 89 patients 
with PPU were included, of whom 52 (58%) received empiric antifungal therapy. 
Propensity score matching resulted in 37 pairs. On logistic regression 
controlling for surgery, vasopressors, and MV, receipt of antifungal therapy was 
not associated with higher odds (odds ratio [OR], 1.5; 95% confidence interval 
[CI], 0.5-4.7; p = 0.4798) of the composite end point. Conclusions: In 
critically ill patients with perforated peptic ulcer, receipt of antifungal 
therapy, regardless of surgical intervention, was not associated with improved 
clinical outcomes. Selection bias is possible and therefore randomized 
controlled trials are required to confirm/refute causality.

Background Patients with invasive mechanical ventilation may be at high risk of 
acquiring venous thromboembolism (VTE). We aim to develop risk assessment models 
for predicting the improvement of VTE in invasively ventilated patients. 
Methodology A total of 6,734 invasively ventilated patients enrolled from the 
Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care-III (MIMIC-III) database were used 
as input for model development and internal validation, while data from 168 
patients from Nanfang Hospital were used for external validation. Logistic 
regression was performed based on predictive factors derived from least absolute 
shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) regression analysis and logistic 
regression with backward selection to develop two Risk Assessment Models (RAM), 
namely, I and II, for the prediction of VTE, respectively. Model selection was 
performed by evaluation of the area under the receiver operating characteristic 
curve (AUC), the goodness of fit with calibration curves, and decision curve 
analyses (DCA). Results RAM-I included prior history of VTE, in-hospital 
immobilization, infection, glucose, the use of antiplatelet, and activated 
partial thromboplastin time (APTT) as variables, while RAM-II included prior 
history of VTE, in-hospital immobilization, infection, ischemic stroke, glucose, 
the use of antiplatelet and APTT as variables. Compared with RAM-I and 
ICU-Venous Thromboembolism Score, RAM-II exhibited better discrimination in the 
training dataset (AUC = 0.826), internal validation dataset (AUC = 0.771), and 
external validation dataset (AUC = 0.770). Additionally, DCA demonstrated that 
RAM-II was clinically beneficial. Inspection of the calibration curves revealed 
good agreement between the predictions and observations. Conclusions A RAM for 
VTE in invasively ventilated patients was developed with reasonable performance.

BACKGROUND: Extracorporeal circulation auxiliary to open heart surgery is a 
common procedure used to treat heart diseases. However, the optimal transfusion 
strategy for patients undergoing this surgery remains a subject of debate. This 
study aims to investigate the association between hemoglobin levels and clinical 
outcomes in patients undergoing extracorporeal circulation auxiliary to open 
heart surgery, with the ultimate goal of improving surgical success rates and 
enhancing patients' quality of life.
METHODS: A retrospective analysis was conducted on data from the Medical 
Information Mart for Intensive Care IV 2.2 (MIMIC-IV 2.2) database, including 
4144 patients. The patients were categorized into five groups based on their 
minimum hemoglobin levels during hospitalization. Baseline characteristics, 
clinical scores, laboratory results, and clinical outcome data were collected. 
Statistical analyses utilized descriptive statistics, ANOVA or Kruskal-Wallis 
tests, Kaplan-Meier method, and Log-rank test.
RESULTS: The results revealed a significant correlation between hemoglobin 
levels and in-hospital mortality, as well as mortality rates at 30 days, 60 
days, and 180 days (p < 0.001). Patients with lower hemoglobin levels exhibited 
higher mortality rates. However, once hemoglobin levels exceeded 7g/dL, no 
significant difference in mortality rates was observed (p = 0.557). 
Additionally, lower hemoglobin levels were associated with prolonged hospital 
stay, ICU admission time, and mechanical ventilation time (p < 0.001). 
Furthermore, hemoglobin levels were significantly correlated with complication 
risk, norepinephrine dosage, and red blood cell transfusion volume (p < 0.001). 
However, there was no significant difference among the groups in terms of major 
complications, specifically sepsis (p > 0.05).
CONCLUSION: The study highlights the importance of managing hemoglobin levels in 
patients undergoing heart surgery with extracorporeal circulation. Hemoglobin 
levels can serve as valuable indicators for predicting clinical outcomes and 
guiding treatment decisions. Physicians should carefully consider hemoglobin 
levels to optimize transfusion strategies and improve postoperative patient 
outcomes. Further research and intervention studies are warranted to validate 
and implement these findings in clinical practice.

This study aimed to preliminarily develop machine learning (ML) models capable 
of predicting the risk of device-associated infection and 30-day outcomes 
following invasive device procedures in intensive care unit (ICU) patients. The 
study utilized data from 8574 ICU patients who underwent invasive procedures, 
sourced from the Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care (MIMIC)-IV version 
2.2 database. Patients were allocated into training and validation datasets in a 
7:3 ratio. Seven ML models were employed for predicting device-associated 
infections, while five models were used for predicting 30-day survival outcomes. 
Model performance was primarily evaluated using the receiver operating 
characteristic (ROC) curve for infection prediction and the survival model's 
concordance index (C-index). Top-performing models progressively reduced the 
number of variables based on their importance, thereby optimizing practical 
utility. The inclusion of all variables demonstrated that extreme gradient 
boosting (XGBoost) and extra survival trees (EST) models yielded superior 
discriminatory performance. Notably, when restricted to the top 10 variables, 
both models maintained performance levels comparable to when all variables were 
included. In the validation cohort, the XGBoost model, with the top 10 
variables, achieved an area under the curve (AUC) of 0.810 (95% CI 0.808-0.812), 
an area under the precision-recall curve (AUPRC) of 0.226 (95% CI 0.222-0.230), 
and a Brier score (BS) of 0.053 (95% CI 0.053-0.054). The EST model, with the 
top 10 variables, reported a C-index of 0.756 (95% CI 0.754-0.757), a 
time-dependent AUC of 0.759 (95% CI 0.763-0.775), and an integrated Brier score 
(IBS) of 0.087 (95% CI 0.087-0.087). Both models are accessible via a web 
application. The internally evaluated XGBoost and EST models demonstrated 
exceptional predictive accuracy for device-associated infection risks and 30-day 
survival outcomes post-invasive procedures in ICU patients. Further validation 
is required to confirm the clinical utility of these two models in future 
studies.

University, Beijing, China.

AIM: Study results on blood glucose and the risk of delirium in patients 
receiving cardiac surgery are inconsistent, and there is also a gap in how to 
manage blood glucose after coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG). This study 
focused on patients with diabetes mellitus (DM) undergoing CABG and explored the 
associations of different blood glucose-related indexes and blood glucose change 
trajectory with postoperative delirium (POD), with the aim of providing some 
information for the management of blood glucose in this population.
METHODS: Data of patients with DM undergoing CABG were extracted from the 
Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care (MIMIC)-IV database in this 
retrospective cohort study. The blood glucose-related indexes included baseline 
blood glucose, mean blood glucose (MBG), mean absolute glucose (MAG), mean 
amplitude of glycemic excursions (MAGE), glycemic lability index (GLI), and 
largest amplitude of glycemic excursions (LAGE). The MBG trajectory was 
classified using the latent growth mixture modeling (LGMM) method. Univariate 
and multivariate logistic regression analyses were utilized to screen covariates 
and explore the associations of blood glucose-related indexes and MBG trajectory 
with POD. These relationships were also assessed in subgroups of age, gender, 
race, estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR), international normalized 
ratio (INR), sepsis, mechanical ventilation use, and vasopressor use. In 
addition, the potential interaction effect between blood glucose and hepatorenal 
function on POD was investigated. The evaluation indexes were odds ratios (ORs), 
relative excess risk due to interaction (RERI), attributable proportion of 
interaction (AP), and 95% confidence intervals (CIs).
RESULTS: Among the eligible 1,951 patients, 180 had POD. After adjusting for 
covariates, higher levels of MBG (OR = 3.703, 95% CI: 1.743-7.870), MAG >0.77 
mmol/L/h (OR = 1.754, 95% CI: 1.235-2.490), and GLI >2.6 (mmol/L)2/h/per se (OR 
= 1.458, 95% CI: 1.033-2.058) were associated with higher odds of POD. The 
positive associations of MBG, MAG, and GLI with POD were observed in patients 
aged <65 years old, male patients, White patients, those with eGFR <60 and 
INR <1.5, patients with sepsis, and those who received mechanical ventilation 
and vasopressors (all p < 0.05). Patients with class 3 (OR = 3.465, 95% CI: 
1.122-10.696) and class 4 (OR = 3.864, 95% CI: 2.083-7.170) MBG trajectory 
seemed to have higher odds of POD, compared to those with a class 1 MBG 
trajectory. Moreover, MAG (RERI = 0.71, 95% CI: 0.14-1.27, AP = 0.71, 95% CI: 
0.12-1.19) and GLI (RERI = 0.78, 95% CI: 0.19-1.39, AP = 0.69, 95% CI: 
0.16-1.12) both had a potential synergistic effect with INR on POD.
CONCLUSION: Focusing on levels of MBG, MAG, GLI, and MBG trajectory may be more 
beneficial to assess the potential risk of POD than the blood glucose level upon 
ICU admission in patients with DM undergoing CABG.

OBJECTIVES: To investigate the independent association of platelet transfusion 
with hospital mortality and key relevant clinical outcomes in cardiac surgery.
DESIGN: A single-center, propensity score-matched, retrospective, cohort study.
SETTING: At an American tertiary teaching hospital data from the Medical 
Information Mart for Intensive Care III and IV databases from 2001 to 2019.
PARTICIPANTS: Consecutive adults undergoing coronary artery bypass graft and/or 
cardiac valvular surgery.
INTERVENTIONS: Platelet transfusion during perioperative intensive care unit 
(ICU) admission.
MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Overall, 12,043 adults met the study inclusion 
criteria. Of these, 1,621 (13.5%) received apheresis-leukoreduced platelets, 
with a median of 1.19 units per recipient (IQR: 0.93-1.19) at a median of 1.78 
hours (IQR: 0.75-4.25) after ICU admission. The platelet count was measured in 
1,176 patients (72.5%) before transfusion, with a median count of 120 × 109/L 
(IQR: 89.0-157.0), and only 53 (3.3%) had platelet counts below 50 × 109/L. 
After propensity matching of 1,046 platelet recipients with 1,046 controls, 
perioperative platelet transfusion carried no association with in-hospital 
mortality (odds ratio [OR]: 1.28; 99% CI: 0.49-3.35; p = 0.4980). However, it 
was associated with a pattern of decreased odds of suspected infection (eg, 
respiratory infection, urinary tract infection, septicaemia, or other; OR: 0.70; 
99% CI: 0.50-0.97; p = 0.0050), days in the hospital (adjusted mean difference 
[AMD]: 0.86; 99% CI: -0.27 to 1.98; p = 0.048), or days in intensive care (AMD 
0.83; 99% CI: -0.15 to 1.82; p = 0.0290).
CONCLUSIONS: Platelet transfusion was not associated with hospital mortality, 
but it was associated with decreased odds of suspected infection and with 
shorter ICU and hospital stays.

OBJECTIVES: To explore the relationship between base excess (BE), alactic BE 
(aBE), and the deterioration of kidney function in patients undergoing coronary 
artery bypass grafting (CABG) surgery.
DESIGN: A retrospective cohort study.
SETTING: The Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care IV (MIMIC-IV) database.
PARTICIPANTS: Patients undergoing CABG surgery.
INTERVENTIONS: None.
MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: The outcome was kidney function deterioration, 
including new-onset acute kidney injury (AKI) and increased severity of AKI. 
Univariate and multivariate logistic regression models were conducted to explore 
the associations between baseline BE, aBE levels, and kidney function 
deterioration in patients undergoing CABG surgery. Odds ratios (ORs) and 95% 
confidence intervals (CIs) are reported. Covariates were adjusted for, including 
sepsis, weight, pulse oximetry-derived oxygen saturation, Simplified Acute 
Physiology Score II, Charlson Comorbidity Index, partial thromboplastin time, 
vasopressor use, loop diuretics, blood infusions, and acetaminophen use. In 
total, 5,634 individuals were included who underwent CABG surgery. BE ≤2.61 (OR= 
1.22, 95% CI: 1.05-1.41) and aBE ≤1.038 (OR = 1.19, 95% CI: 1.02-1.38) were 
related to the higher incidence of kidney function deterioration. aBE ≤1.038 (OR 
= 1.26, 95% CI: 1.01-1.57) was linked to a higher incidence of new onset of AKI. 
In patients who had AKI at baseline, BE ≤2.61 (OR = 1.88, 95% CI: 1.47-2.41) and 
aBE ≤1.038 (OR = 1.82, 95% CI: 1.42-2.33) were also related to increased odds of 
AKI recovery. The relationships between lower BE and aBE and higher odds of 
kidney function deterioration were also found in those aged ≥65 years, males, 
patients without chronic kidney disease, patients given vasopressors, and those 
not administered loop diuretics, nephrotoxic antibiotics, blood infusions, and 
acetaminophen.
CONCLUSION: Lower BE and aBE values are associated with an increased risk of 
kidney function deterioration in patients undergoing CABG surgery. BE and aBE 
could serve as early markers of kidney injury.

Objectives: This study aimed to analyze clinical characteristics and outcomes of 
critically ill patients with multiple myeloma (MM) admitted to the intensive 
care unit (ICU) and identify predictors of poor short-term prognosis. Methods: 
Data for patients with MM admitted to the ICU were extracted from the Medical 
Information Mart for Intensive Care III database. The risk factors leading to 
the ICU and hospital mortality were evaluated using logistic regression 
analysis. Results: Of 126 patients identified, 17 (13.5%) and 37 (29.4%) died in 
the ICU and hospital, respectively. Patients with ICU mortality showed higher 
median blood urea nitrogen (57.0 vs. 29.0) and poorer Acute Physiology Scores 
(APS, 70.0 vs. 46.0) than did surviving patients on the day of ICU admission. 
In-ICU deceased patients had higher proportion of mechanical ventilation (64.7% 
vs. 26.6%) and vasopressor use (64.7% vs. 17.4%) at admission and positive 
pathogenic culture during ICU stay (58.8% vs. 19.3%). The APS and positive 
pathogenic culture were independent prognostic factors for ICU mortality, while 
risk factors for hospital mortality included higher APS and relapsed/refractory 
disease. Conclusion: The short-term prognoses for patients with MM admitted to 
the ICU were mainly determined by the severity of organ failure, infection, and 
disease status.

Background: The relationship between urine output (UO) and severe-stage 
progression in the early phase of acute kidney injury (AKI) remains unclear. 
This study aimed to investigate the relationship between early-phase UO6-12h [UO 
within 6 h after diagnosis of stage 1 AKI by Kidney Disease: Improving Global 
Outcomes (KDIGO) UO criteria] and severe-stage progression of AKI and to 
identify a reference value of early-phase UO6-12h for guiding initial therapy in 
critical care. Methods: Adult patients with UO < 0.5 ml/kg/h for the first 6 h 
after intensive care unit (ICU) admission (meeting stage 1 AKI by UO) and 
UO6-12h ≥ 0.5 ml/kg/h were identified from the Medical Information Mart for 
Intensive Care (MIMIC) III database. The primary outcome was progression to 
stage 2/3 AKI by UO. After other variables were adjusted through multivariate 
analysis, generalized additive model (GAM) was used to visualize the 
relationship between early-phase UO6-12h and progression to stage 2/3 AKI by UO. 
A two-piecewise linear regression model was employed to identify the inflection 
point of early-phase UO6-12h above which progression risk significantly leveled 
off. Sensitivity and subgroup analyses were performed to assess the robustness 
of our findings. Results: Of 2,984 individuals, 1,870 (62.7%) with KDIGO stage 1 
UO criteria progressed to stage 2/3 AKI. In the multivariate analysis, 
early-phase UO6-12h showed a significant association with progression to stage 
2/3 AKI by UO (odds ratio, 0.40; 95% confidence interval, 0.34-0.46; p < 0.001). 
There was a non-linear relationship between early-phase UO6-12h and progression 
of AKI. Early-phase UO6-12h of 1.1 ml/kg/h was identified as the inflection 
point, above which progression risk significantly leveled off (p = 0.780). 
Patients with early-phase UO6-12h ≥ 1.1 ml/kg/h had significantly shorter length 
of ICU stay (3.82 vs. 4.17 days, p < 0.001) and hospital stay (9.28 vs. 10.43 
days, p < 0.001) and lower 30-day mortality (11.05 vs. 18.42%, p < 0.001). The 
robustness of our findings was confirmed by sensitivity and subgroup analyses. 
Conclusions: Among early-stage AKI patients in critical care, there was a 
non-linear relationship between early-phase UO6-12h and progression of AKI. 
Early-phase UO6-12h of 1.1 ml/kg/h was the inflection point above which 
progression risk significantly leveled off.

BACKGROUND: To construct and validate a risk assessment model for acute kidney 
injury (AKI) in patients with acute pancreatitis (AP) in the intensive care unit 
(ICU).
METHODS: A total of 963 patients diagnosed with acute pancreatitis (AP) from the 
Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care IV (MIMIC-IV) database was included. 
These patients were randomly divided into training set (N = 674) and validation 
set (N = 289) at a ratio of 7:3. Clinical characteristics were utilized to 
establish a nomogram for the prediction of AKI during ICU stay. These variables 
were selected by the least absolute shrinkage and selection operation (LASSO) 
regression and included in multivariate logistic regression analysis. Variables 
with P-values less than 0.05 were included in the final model. A nomogram was 
constructed based on the final model. The predicted accuracy of the nomogram was 
assessed by calculating the receiver operating characteristic curve (ROC) and 
the area under the curve (AUC). Moreover, calibration curves and Hosmer-Lemeshow 
goodness-of-fit test (HL test) were performed to evaluate model performance. 
Decision curve analysis (DCA) evaluated the clinical net benefit of the model.
RESULTS: A multivariable model that included 6 variables: weight, SOFA score, 
white blood cell count, albumin, chronic heart failure, and sepsis. The C-index 
of the nomogram was 0.82, and the area under the receiver operating 
characteristic curve (AUC) of the training set and validation set were 0.82 (95% 
confidence interval:0.79-0.86) and 0.76 (95% confidence interval: 0.70-0.82), 
respectively. Calibration plots showed good consistency between predicted and 
observed outcomes in both the training and validation sets. DCA confirmed the 
clinical value of the model and its good impact on actual decision-making.
CONCLUSION: We identified risk factors associated with the development of AKI in 
patients with AP. A risk prediction model for AKI in ICU patients with AP was 
constructed, and improving the treatment strategy of relevant factors in the 
model can reduce the risk of AKI in AP patients.

BACKGROUND: Traditional scoring systems for patients' outcome prediction in 
intensive care units such as Oxygenation Saturation Index (OSI) and Oxygenation 
Index (OI) may not reliably predict the clinical prognosis of patients with 
acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). Thus, none of them have been widely 
accepted for mortality prediction in ARDS. This study aimed to develop and 
validate a mortality prediction method for patients with ARDS based on machine 
learning using the Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care (MIMIC-III) and 
Telehealth Intensive Care Unit (eICU) Collaborative Research Database (eICU-CRD) 
databases.
METHODS: Patients with ARDS were selected based on the Berlin definition in 
MIMIC-III and eICU-CRD databases. The APPS score (using age, PaO2/FiO2, and 
plateau pressure), Simplified Acute Physiology Score II (SAPS-II), 
Sepsis-related Organ Failure Assessment (SOFA), OSI, and OI were calculated. 
With MIMIC-III data, a mortality prediction model was built based on the random 
forest (RF) algorithm, and the performance was compared to those of existing 
scoring systems based on logistic regression. The performance of the proposed RF 
method was also validated with the combined MIMIC-III and eICU-CRD data. The 
performance of mortality prediction was evaluated by using the area under the 
receiver operating characteristics curve (AUROC) and performing calibration 
using the Hosmer-Lemeshow test.
RESULTS: With the MIMIC-III dataset (308 patients, for comparisons with the 
existing scoring systems), the RF model predicted the in-hospital mortality, 
30-day mortality, and 1-year mortality with an AUROC of 0.891, 0.883, and 0.892, 
respectively, which were significantly higher than those of the SAPS-II, APPS, 
OSI, and OI (all P<0.001). In the multi-source validation (the combined dataset 
of 2,235 patients in MIMIC-III and 331 patients in eICU-CRD), the RF model 
achieved an AUROC of 0.905 and 0.736 for predicting in-hospital mortality for 
the MIMIC-III and eICU-CRD datasets, respectively. The calibration plots 
suggested good fits for our RF model and these scoring systems for predicting 
mortality. The platelet count and lactate level were the strongest predictive 
variables for predicting in-hospital mortality.
CONCLUSIONS: Compared to the existing scoring systems, machine learning 
significantly improved performance for predicting ARDS mortality. Validation 
with multi-source datasets showed a relatively robust generalisation ability of 
our prediction model.

OBJECTIVES: The association of cryoprecipitate transfusion with patient outcomes 
after cardiac surgery is unclear. We aimed to investigate the predictors of, and 
outcomes associated with, postoperative cryoprecipitate transfusion in cardiac 
surgery patients.
METHODS: We used the Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care III and IV 
databases. We included adults undergoing cardiac surgery, and propensity score 
matched cryoprecipitate-treated patients to controls. Using the matched cohort, 
we investigated the association of cryoprecipitate use with clinical outcomes. 
The primary outcome was in-hospital mortality. Secondary outcomes were 
infection, acute kidney injury, intensive care unit length of stay, hospital 
length of stay, and chest tube output at 2-hour intervals.
RESULTS: Of 12,043 eligible patients, 283 (2.35%) patients received 
cryoprecipitate. The median dose was 5.83 units (IQR 4.17-7.24) given at a 
median first transfusion time of 1.75 hours (IQR 0.73-4.46) after intensive care 
unit admission. After propensity scoring, we matched 195 cryoprecipitate 
recipients to 743 controls. Postoperative cryoprecipitate transfusion was not 
significantly associated with in-hospital mortality (odds ratio [OR] 1.10; 99% 
confidence interval [CI] 0.43-2.84; p=0.791), infection (OR 0.77; 99% CI 
0.45-1.34; p=0.220), acute kidney injury (OR 1.03; 99% CI 0.65-1.62; p=0.876) or 
cumulative chest tube output (adjusted mean difference 8 hrs post transfusion, 
11 mL; 99% CI -104 to 125; p=0.804).
CONCLUSIONS: Although cryoprecipitate was typically given to sicker patients 
with more bleeding, its administration was not associated with worse outcomes. 
Large, multicentred studies are warranted to further elucidate cryoprecipitate's 
safety profile and patterns of use in cardiac surgery.

Acute kidney injury (AKI) is one of the common complications of pulmonary 
infections. However, nomograms predicting the risk of early-onset AKI in 
patients with pulmonary infections have not been comprehensively researched. In 
this study, 3278 patients with pulmonary infection were extracted from the 
Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care III (MIMIC-III) database. These 
patients were randomly divided into training and validation cohorts, with the 
training cohort used for model building and the validation cohort used for 
validation. Independent risk factors for patients with pulmonary infection were 
determined using the least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) 
method and forward stepwise logistic regression, which revealed that 11 
independent risk factors for AKI in patients with pulmonary infections were 
congestive heart failure (CHF), hypertension, diabetes, transcutaneous oxygen 
saturation (SpO2), 24-h urine output, white blood cells (WBC), serum creatinine 
(Scr), prothrombin time (PT), potential of hydrogen (PH), vasopressor use, and 
mechanical ventilation (MV) use. The nomogram was then constructed and 
validated. The area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) 
values of the nomogram were 0.770 (95% CI = 0.789-0.807) in the training cohort 
and 0.724 (95% CI = 0.754-0.784) in the validation cohort. High AUC values 
indicated the good discriminative ability of the nomogram, while the calibration 
curves and Hosmer-Lemeshow test results indicated that the nomogram was 
well-calibrated. Improvements in net reclassification index (NRI) and integrated 
discrimination improvement (IDI) values indicate that our nomogram was superior 
to the Simplified Acute Physiology Score (SAPS) II scoring system, and the 
decision-curve analysis (DCA) curves indicate that the nomogram has good 
clinical application. We established a risk-prediction model for AKI in patients 
with pulmonary infection, which has good discriminative power and is superior to 
the SAPS II scoring system. This model can provide clinical reference 
information for patients with this type of disease in the intensive care unit.

OBJECTIVE: To develop a nomogram for predicting occurrence of secondary 
pulmonary infection in patients with critically traumatic brain injury (TBI) 
during their stay in the intensive care unit, to further optimise personalised 
treatment for patients and support the development of effective, evidence-based 
prevention and intervention strategies.
DATA SOURCE: This study used patient data from the publicly available MIMIC-IV 
(Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care IV) database.
DESIGN: A population-based retrospective cohort study.
METHODS: In this retrospective cohort study, 1780 patients with TBI were 
included and randomly divided into a training set (n=1246) and a development set 
(n=534). The impact of pulmonary infection on survival was analysed using 
Kaplan-Meier curves. A univariate logistic regression model was built in 
training set to identify potential factors for pulmonary infection, and 
independent risk factors were determined in a multivariate logistic regression 
model to build nomogram model. Nomogram performance was assessed with receiver 
operating characteristic (ROC) curves, calibration curves and Hosmer-Lemeshow 
test, and predictive value was assessed by decision curve analysis (DCA).
RESULT: This study included a total of 1780 patients with TBI, of which 186 
patients (approximately 10%) developed secondary lung infections, and 21 
patients died during hospitalisation. Among the 1594 patients who did not 
develop lung infections, only 85 patients died (accounting for 5.3%). The 
survival curves indicated a significant survival disadvantage for patients with 
TBI with pulmonary infection at 7 and 14 days after intensive care unit 
admission (p<0.001). Both univariate and multivariate logistic regression 
analyses showed that factors such as race other than white or black, respiratory 
rate, temperature, mechanical ventilation, antibiotics and congestive heart 
failure were independent risk factors for pulmonary infection in patients with 
TBI (OR>1, p<0.05). Based on these factors, along with Glasgow Coma Scale and 
international normalised ratio variables, a training set model was constructed 
to predict the risk of pulmonary infection in patients with TBI, with an area 
under the ROC curve of 0.800 in the training set and 0.768 in the validation 
set. The calibration curve demonstrated the model's good calibration and 
consistency with actual observations, while DCA indicated the practical utility 
of the predictive model in clinical practice.
CONCLUSION: This study established a predictive model for pulmonary infections 
in patients with TBI, which may help clinical doctors identify high-risk 
patients early and prevent occurrence of pulmonary infections.

This study aims to identify risk factors for secondary venous thromboembolism 
(VTE) in stroke patients and establish a nomogram, an accurate predictor of 
probability of VTE occurrence during hospitalization in stroke patients. Medical 
Information Mart for Intensive Care IV (MIMIC-IV) database of critical care 
medicine was utilized to retrieve information of stroke patients admitted to the 
hospital between 2008 and 2019. Patients were randomly allocated into train set 
and test set at 7:3. Univariate and multivariate logistic regression analyses 
were used to identify independent risk factors for secondary VTE in stroke 
patients. A predictive nomogram model was constructed, and the predictive 
ability of the nomogram was evaluated using receiver operating characteristic 
(ROC) curves, calibration curves, and decision curve analysis (DCA). This study 
included 266 stroke patients, with 26 patients suffering secondary VTE after 
stroke. A nomogram for predicting risk of secondary VTE in stroke patients was 
built according to pulmonary infection, partial thromboplastin time (PTT), 
log-formed D-dimer, and mean corpuscular hemoglobin (MCH). Area under the curve 
(AUC) of the predictive model nomogram was 0.880 and 0.878 in the train and test 
sets, respectively. The calibration curve was near the diagonal, and DCA curve 
presented positive net benefit. This indicates the model's good predictive 
performance and clinical utility. The nomogram effectively predicts the risk 
probability of secondary VTE in stroke patients, aiding clinicians in early 
identification and personalized treatment of stroke patients at risk of 
developing secondary VTE.

AIM: Prognostic assessment plays an important role in the effective management 
of patients with spontaneous intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH). The study aimed to 
investigate whether elevated red cell distribution width-to-platelet ratio (RPR) 
at admission was related to 30-day death in patients with spontaneous 
intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH).
METHODS: This retrospective cohort study included 2,823 adult patients with ICH 
from the Multiparameter Intelligent Monitoring in Intensive Care (MIMIC) III and 
IV databases between 2001 and 2019. The Cox proportional hazard model was 
utilized to evaluate the relationship between RPR levels and 30-day death risk. 
The area under receiver-operating characteristic curve (AUC) was used to assess 
the predictive ability of RPR for 30-day death in patients with ICH.
RESULTS: At the end of the 30-day follow-up, 799 (28.30%) patients died, and the 
median RPR level was 0.066 (0.053, 0.087). After adjusting for confounders, the 
tertile 3 of RPR levels [hazard ratio (HR) = 1.37, 95% confidence interval (CI): 
1.15-1.64] were associated with a higher risk of 30-day death in patients with 
ICH compared with tertile 1. In the stratified analyses, elevated RPR levels 
were found to be associated with an increased risk of 30-day death in patients 
aged <65 years (HR = 1.77, 95%CI: 1.29-2.43), aged ≥65 years (HR = 1.30, 95%CI: 
1.05-1.61), with Glasgow Coma Score (GCS) <14 (HR = 1.65, 95%CI: 1.27-2.14), 
with Charlson comorbidity index (CCI) ≥4 (HR = 1.45, 95%CI: 1.17-1.80), with (HR 
= 1.66, 95%CI: 1.13-2.43) or without sepsis (HR = 1.32, 95%CI: 1.08-1.61), and 
female patients (HR = 1.75, 95%CI: 1.35-2.26) but not in male patients (P = 
0.139) and patients with GCS ≥14 (P = 0.058) or CCI <4 (P = 0.188). The AUC for 
RPR to predict 30-day death in patients with ICH was 0.795 (95%CI: 0.763-0.828) 
in the testing set, indicating a good predictive ability.
CONCLUSION: Elevated RPR levels were correlated with an increased risk of 30-day 
death in patients with ICH, and RPP levels showed good predictive ability for 
30-day death.

BACKGROUND: Considering the therapeutic difficulties and mortality associated 
with bloodstream infection (BSI), it is essential to investigate other potential 
factors affecting mortality in critically ill patients with BSI and examine the 
utility of the quick Pitt bacteremia (qPitt) score to improve the survival rate.
OBJECTIVES: To improve the predictive accuracy of the qPitt scoring system by 
evaluating the five current components of qPitt and including other potential 
factors influencing mortality in critically ill patients with BSI.
DESIGN: This was a retrospective cohort study.
METHODS: Medical information from the Medical Information Mart for Intensive 
Care IV database was used in this retrospective cohort study. The risk factors 
associated with mortality were examined using a multivariate logistic regression 
model. The area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) was used 
to assess the discriminatory capability of the prediction models.
RESULTS: In total, 1240 eligible critically ill patients with BSI were included. 
After adjustment for age, community-onset BSI, indwelling invasive lines, and 
Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) ⩽ 8, acute kidney injury (AKI) was identified as a 
notable risk factor for 14-day mortality. Except for altered mental status, the 
four other main components of the original qPitt were significantly associated 
with 14-day mortality. Hence, we established a modified qPitt (m-qPitt) by 
adding AKI and replacing altered mental status with GCS ⩽ 8. The AUCs for 
m-qPitt and qPitt were 0.723 [95% confidence interval (CI): 0.683-0.759] and 
0.708 (95% CI: 0.669-0.745) in predicting 14-day mortality, respectively. 
Moreover, m-qPitt also had acceptable performance and discrimination power 
[0.700 (95% CI: 0.666-0.732)] in predicting 28-day mortality.
CONCLUSION: AKI significantly influenced the survival of critically ill patients 
with BSIs. Compared with the original qPitt, our new m-qPitt was proven to have 
a better predictive performance for mortality in critically ill patients with 
BSI. Further studies should be conducted to validate the practicality of 
m-qPitt.

BACKGROUND: Frailty correlates with adverse outcomes in many cardiovascular 
diseases and is prevalent in individuals with heart failure (HF). The Hospital 
Frailty Risk Score (HFRS) offers an integrated, validated solution for frailty 
assessment in acute care settings, but its application in critically ill 
patients with congestive HF lacks exploration. This study aimed to identify the 
association between frailty assessed by the HFRS and in-hospital mortality in 
critically ill patients with congestive HF.
METHODS: This observational study retrospectively enrolled 12,179 critically ill 
patients with congestive HF. Data from the Medical Information Mart for 
Intensive Care IV database was used. The HFRS was calculated to assess frailty. 
Patients were categorized into three groups: non-frailty (HFRS < 5, n = 7,961), 
pre-frailty (5 ≤ HFRS < 15, n = 3,684), and frailty (HFRS ≥ 15, n = 534). 
Outcomes included in-hospital mortality, length of intensive care unit stay, and 
length of hospital stay. Multiple logistic regression and Locally Weighted 
Scatterplot Smoothing (LOWESS) smoother were used to investigate the association 
between frailty and outcomes. Subgroup analysis was employed to elucidate the 
correlation between frailty levels and in-hospital mortality across diverse 
subgroups.
RESULTS: 12,179 patients were enrolled, 6,679 (54.8%) were male, and the average 
age was 71.05 ± 13.94 years. The overall in-hospital mortality was 11.7%. 
In-hospital mortality increased with the escalation of frailty levels 
(non-frailty vs. pre-frailty vs. frailty: 9.7% vs. 14.8% vs. 20.2%, P < 0.001). 
The LOWESS curve demonstrated that the HFRS was monotonically positively 
correlated with in-hospital mortality. Upon controlling for potential 
confounders, both pre-frailty and frailty statuses were found to be 
independently linked to a heightened risk of mortality during hospitalization 
(odds ratio [95% confidence interval]: pre-frailty vs. non-frailty: 1.27 
[1.10-1.47], P = 0.001; frailty vs. non-frailty: 1.40 [1.07-1.83], P = 0.015; P 
for trend < 0.001). Significant interactions between frailty levels and 
in-hospital mortality were observed in the following subgroups: race, heart 
rate, creatinine, antiplatelet drug, diabetes, cerebrovascular disease, chronic 
renal disease, and sepsis.
CONCLUSION: In critically ill patients with congestive HF, frailty as assessed 
by the HFRS emerged as an independent predictor for the risk of in-hospital 
mortality. Prospective, randomized studies are required to determine whether 
improvement of frailty levels could improve clinical prognosis.

Heart failure (HF) is associated with poor prognosis. While various immune 
markers have been linked to HF outcomes, the relationship between eosinophils 
(EOS) and prognosis across different HF phenotypes remains unclear and 
controversial. In this study, we analyzed 2,677 HF patients from the Medical 
Information Mart for Intensive Care III (MIMIC-III) database, categorizing them 
into reduced ejection fraction (≤ 50%) and preserved ejection fraction (> 50%) 
groups. Multiple logistic regression, Kaplan-Meier survival curve estimation, 
Cox proportional hazards model, and restricted cubic splines were employed to 
assess the association between admission EOS and mortality. Subgroup analyses 
were conducted based on age, gender, sepsis, atrial fibrillation, hypertension 
and rheumatic and immunological diseases and mechanical ventilation. A total of 
954 patients with heart failure with reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF) and 1723 
patients with heart failure with preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF) were 
enrolled, with a female proportion of 37.84% and 56.88%, respectively. The 
median age of patients was 74.46 (IQR: 63.34-83.26) years and the median EOS was 
0.09 (IQR: 0.04-0.20). Among these patients, in-hospital mortality was 14.5% 
(389 patients), and the overall 90-day mortality rate reached 27.12% (726 
patients). There were no significant differences in EOS levels between the HFrEF 
and HFpEF groups (0.1 vs. 0.09, P = 0.154). After adjusting for confounders, 
multivariate logistic regression showed that higher EOS quartiles were 
associated with reduced in-hospital mortality in HFrEF patients, with quartile 3 
(Q3) (OR 0.54, 95% CI 0.31-0.96, P = 0.035) and Q4 (OR 0.37, 95% CI 0.19-0.71, 
P = 0.003) showing significant protective effects compared with the lowest EOS 
quartile (Q1), while Q2 did not reach statistical significance (P = 0.931). 
Subgroup analyses yielded similar findings. Multivariate Cox regression 
demonstrated a reduced hazard ratio in Q4 (HR 0.64, 95% CI 0.44-0.94, P = 0.023) 
compared with Q1 in HFrEF patients. However, no significant association was 
observed between EOS and prognosis in HFpEF. Our findings indicated that higher 
EOS was associated with improved in-hospital and 90-day survival in ICU patients 
with HFrEF, but not in those with HFpEF.

STUDY OBJECTIVE: The lactate-to-albumin ratio (LAR) has been confirmed to be an 
effective prognostic marker in sepsis, heart failure, and acute respiratory 
failure. However, the relationship between LAR and mortality in patients with 
acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) remains unclear. We aim to evaluate 
the predictive value of LAR for ARDS patients.
DESIGN: A retrospective cohort study.
SETTING: Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care IV (v2.2) database.
PATIENTS: 769 patients with acute respiratory distress syndrome(ARDS).
INTERVENTIONS: We divided the patients into two subgroups according to the 
primary study endpoint (28-days all-cause mortality): the 28-day survivors and 
the 28-day non-survivors.
MEASURES: Multivariate Cox Regression, Receiver Operator Characteristic (ROC) 
and Kaplan-Meier survival analysis were used to investigate the relationship 
between LAR and short-time mortality in patients with ARDS.
MAIN RESULTS: The 28-day mortality was 38 % in this study. Multivariable Cox 
regression analysis showed that LAR was an independent predictive factor for 
28-day mortality (HR 1.11, 95 %CI: 1.06-1.16, P < 0.001). The area under curve 
(AUC) of LAR in the ROC was 70.34 % (95 %CI: 66.53 % - 74.15 %) that provided 
significantly higher discrimination compared with lactate (AUC = 68.00 %, 
P = 0.0007) or albumin (AUC = 63.17 %, P = 0.002) alone. LAR was also not 
inferior to SAPSII with the AUC of 73.44 % (95 %CI: 69.84 % - 77.04 %, 
P = 0.21). Additionally, Kaplan-Meier survival analysis displayed that ARDS 
patients with high LAR (> the cut-off value 0.9055) had a significantly higher 
28-day overall mortality rate (P < 0.001) and in-hospital mortality rate 
(P < 0.001). However, patients in high LAR group had shorter length of hospital 
stay (P < 0.001), which might be caused by higher in-hospital mortality.
CONCLUSIONS: We confirmed that there was a positive correlation between LAR and 
28-day mortality. This could provide anesthesiologists and critical care 
physicians with a more convenient tool than SAPSII without being superior for 
detecting ARDS patients with poor prognosis timely.

RESEARCH OBJECTIVES: Clostriodiodes difficile infection (CDI) is a major cause 
of healthcare-associated diarrhoea with high mortality. There is a lack of 
validated predictors for severe outcomes in CDI. The aim of this study is to 
derive and validate a clinical prediction tool for CDI in-hospital mortality 
using a large critical care database.
METHODOLOGY: The demographics, clinical parameters, laboratory results and 
mortality of CDI were extracted from the Medical Information Mart for Intensive 
Care-III (MIMIC-III) database. We subsequently trained three machine learning 
models: logistic regression (LR), random forest (RF) and gradient boosting 
machine (GBM) to predict in-hospital mortality. The individual performances of 
the models were compared against current severity scores (Clostridiodes 
difficile Associated Risk of Death Score (CARDS) and ATLAS (Age, Treatment with 
systemic antibiotics, leukocyte count, Albumin and Serum creatinine as a measure 
of renal function) by calculating area under receiver operating curve (AUROC). 
We identified factors associated with higher mortality risk in each model.
SUMMARY OF RESULTS: From 61 532 intensive care unit stays in the MIMIC-III 
database, there were 1315 CDI cases. The mortality rate for CDI in the study 
cohort was 18.33%. AUROC was 0.69 (95% CI, 0.60 to 0.76) for LR, 0.71 (95% CI, 
0.62 to 0.77) for RF and 0.72 (95% CI, 0.64 to 0.78) for GBM, while previously 
AUROC was 0.57 (95% CI, 0.51 to 0.65) for CARDS and 0.63 (95% CI, 0.54 to 0.70) 
for ATLAS. Albumin, lactate and bicarbonate were significant mortality factors 
for all the models. Free calcium, potassium, white blood cell, urea, platelet 
and mean blood pressure were present in at least two of the three models.
CONCLUSION: Our machine learning derived CDI in-hospital mortality prediction 
model identified pertinent factors that can assist critical care clinicians in 
identifying patients at high risk of dying from CDI.

OBJECTIVE: The lactate/albumin ratio (LAR) has been used as a novel prognostic 
indicator for aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage, traumatic brain injury, 
sepsis, heart failure, and acute respiratory failure. However, its potential in 
predicting all-cause mortality in patients with ischemic stroke (IS) has not 
been evaluated. Therefore, this study aimed to elucidate the correlation between 
LAR and 28-day all-cause mortality in IS patients without reperfusion therapy.
METHODS: This retrospective cohort study used data from the Medical Information 
Mart for Intensive Care (MIMIC-IV) (v2.0) database. It included 568 IS adult 
patients admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU). The correlation between LAR 
and ICU 28-day all-cause mortality rate was analyzed using multiple COX 
regression analysis and Kaplan-Meier survival analysis. Restricted cubic spline 
(RCS) curves were used to assess the relationship between LAR and 28-day 
mortality. In addition, a subgroup analysis was performed to investigate the 
impact of other influencing factors on outcomes. The primary outcome was the 
ability of LAR to predict 28-day mortality in IS patients.
RESULTS: Among the 568 patients with IS, 370 survived (survival group) and 198 
died (non-survival group) within 28 days of admission (mortality rate: 34.9%). A 
multivariate COX regression analysis indicated that LAR was an independent 
predictor of all-cause mortality within 28 days after admission for patients 
with IS (hazard ratio: 1.32; 95% confidence interval: 1.03-1.68; P = 0.025). We 
constructed a model that included LAR, age, race, sex, white blood cell count, 
Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (SOFA) score, and anion gap (AG) and 
established a prediction model with an area under the curve (AUC) value of 71.5% 
(95% confidence interval: 67.1%-75.8%). The optimal cutoff value of LAR that 
separated the survival group and the non-survival group based on the Youden 
index was 0.55. The Kaplan-Meier survival curves plotted using this critical 
value showed that patients with LAR ≥ 0.55 had a significantly higher 28-day 
all-cause mortality rate than patients with LAR < 0.55 (P = 0.0083).
CONCLUSION: LAR can serve as an independent predictor of all-cause mortality 
within 28 days after admission for patients with IS.

INTRODUCTION: Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) is a hospital-acquired 
infection with high mortality, and remains a challenge for clinical treatment. 
Red blood cell distribution width (RDW) was associated with worse outcomes in 
several diseases. The purpose of this study was to investigate the relationship 
between mean RDW values, changes in RDW (delta RDW), and in-hospital mortality 
among patients with VAP.
METHODS: In the present study, we enrolled 1266 VAP patients from the Medical 
Information Mart for Intensive Care IV (MIMIC-IV) database. All patients were 
categorized into low group, medium group, and high group according to tertiles 
of mean RDW values. The primary outcome was all-cause in-hospital mortality. 
Univariate logistic regression analysis, multivariate logistic regression 
analysis, and restricted cubic spline (RCS) curve were performed to determine 
the association between mean RDW values and in-hospital mortality in VAP. 
Moreover, RCS curve was plotted to explore the dose-response relationship 
between delta RDW and in-hospital mortality in VAP.
RESULTS: Among the VAP patients included in the study, the in-hospital mortality 
was 20.85% with 264 non-survivors and 1002 survivors. The non-survivors 
exhibited significantly higher mean RDW values and delta RDW values compared to 
survivors. Multivariate logistic regression analysis indicated that mean RDW 
values were positively associated with in-hospital mortality in VAP after 
adjusting for relevant covariates. The RCS curve demonstrated a dose-response 
relationship between mean RDW and the mortality in VAP. Moreover, a linear 
relationship was observed between delta RDW and in-hospital mortality in VAP.
CONCLUSION: Higher mean RDW values were significantly associated with an 
increased risk of in-hospital mortality in VAP. Additionally, a linear 
relationship was found between delta RDW values and in-hospital mortality. These 
findings suggest that RDW can be used to identify high-risk patients with poorer 
outcomes in VAP.

Hip Fracture: A MIMIC-IV Cohort Study.

Yuan W, Xiao M, Wang R, Liu G, Wu J, Wang X.

BACKGROUND: The impact of hip fracture on older adults is significant, including 
increased mortality, reduced activity levels and abilities and reduced quality 
of life。 Hip fractures often occur in the elderly and increase the risk of 
death. The purpose of this study is to analyze the risk factors associated with 
28-day mortality in elderly patients with severe hip fractures using two models, 
XG Boost and multivariate logistic regression, and to compare the predictive 
value of the two models.
METHODS: MIMIC database is a powerful tool to provide clinical data to clinical 
researchers. The database was established in 2003 with funding from the National 
Institutes of Health by the Computational Physiology Laboratory at the 
Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center 
(BIDMC) at Harvard Medical School, and Philips Medical. Patients with severe hip 
fractures in the elderly were included based on the MIMIC-IV database and were 
divided into a death group and a survival group based on the death 28 days after 
admission to the ICU. Baseline data differences between the two groups of 
patients were compared, and risk factors associated with 28-day mortality in 
severe elderly patients with hip fractures were analyzed using XG Boost and 
multivariate logistic regression models, respectively. The predictive power of 
the two models was compared using receiver operation characteristics curves.
RESULTS: 287 elderly patients with severe hip fractures were included, including 
43 cases (15.0%) in the death group and 244 cases (85.0%) in the survival group. 
Logistic regression analysis showed that advanced age, male, congestive heart 
failure (CHF), chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), high sepsis-related 
organ failure (SOFA) score, high heart rate, high white blood cell count, high 
creatinine, high mean arterial pressure, and high hemoglobin levels were 
associated with 28-day mortality after admission to the ICU, while the higher 
the mean arterial pressure and the hemoglobin level, the lower the risk of 
death. Although the rate of using mechanical ventilation and receiving blood 
transfusion in the death group was higher than that in the survival group, 
neither of them reached statistical significance. The XG Boost model shows that 
the top 5 factors associated with 28-day mortality are Sequential organ failure 
score (SOFA) score (31 points), chronic heart failure (20 points), chronic 
structural pulmonary disease (18 points), age (17 points), and male (15 points). 
The higher the mean arterial pressure and the hemoglobin level, the lower the 
risk of death. The area under the ROC curve predicted by the multivariate 
logistic regression model for mortality risk was 0.729 (95% CI: 0.701-0.783), 
and the Jordan index was 0.412. The area under the ROC curve predicted by the XG 
Boost model for mortality risk was 0.804 (95% CI: 0.720-0.837), and the Jordan 
index was 0.492.
CONCLUSION: The ability of the XG Boost model to predict the 28-day mortality 
risk in elderly patients with severe hip fractures is better than the 
multivariate logistic regression model, which will help healthcare professionals 
provide more support for elderly patients with hip fracture.

BACKGROUND AND AIMS: New-onset atrial fibrillation (NOAF) is a common 
manifestation in critically ill patients. There is a paucity of evidence 
indicating a relationship between urinary ketones and NOAF.
METHODS: Critically ill patients with urinary ketone measurements from the 
Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care (MIMIC-IV) database were included. 
The primary outcome was NOAF Propensity score matching was performed following 
by multivariable logistic regression.
RESULTS: A total of 24,688 patients with available data of urine ketone were 
included in this study. The urine ketone of 4014 patients was tested positive. 
The average age of the included participants was 63.8 years old, and 54.5% of 
them were male. Result of the fully-adjusted binary logistic regression model 
showed that patients with positive urinary ketone was associated with a 
significantly lower risk of NOAF (Odds ratio, 0.79, 95% CI 0.7-0.9), compared 
with those with negative urinary ketone. In the subgroup analysis according to 
diabetic status, compared with nondiabetics, patients with diabetes had lower 
risk of NOAF (p-values for interaction < 0.05). Results of other subgroup 
analyses according to gender, age, infection, myocardial infarction, and 
congestive heart failure were consistent with the primary analysis.
CONCLUSIONS: Positive urinary ketone body may be associated with reduced risk of 
NOAF in critically ill patients during intensive care unit hospitalization. 
Further studies are needed to clarify the underlying mechanisms.

INTRODUCTION: Heart failure (HF) may induce bowel hypoperfusion, leading to 
hypoxia of the villa of the bowel wall and the occurrence of Clostridioides 
difficile infection (CDI). However, the risk factors for the development of CDI 
in HF patients have yet to be fully illustrated, especially because of a lack of 
evidence from real-world data.
METHODS: Clinical data and survival situations of HF patients with CDI admitted 
to ICU were extracted from the Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care 
(MIMIC)-IV database. For developing a model that can predict 28-day all-cause 
mortality in HF patients with CDI, the Recursive Feature Elimination with 
Cross-Validation (RFE-CV) method was used for feature selection. And nine 
machine learning (ML) algorithms, including logistic regression (LR), decision 
tree, Bayesian, adaptive boosting, random forest (RF), gradient boosting 
decision tree, XGBoost, light gradient boosting machine, and categorical 
boosting, were applied for model construction. After training and hyperparameter 
optimization of the models through grid search 5-fold cross-validation, the 
performance of models was evaluated by the area under curve (AUC), accuracy, 
sensitivity, specificity, precision, negative predictive value, and F1 score. 
Furthermore, the SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) method was used to 
interpret the optimal model.
RESULTS: A total of 526 HF patients with CDI were included in the study, of whom 
99 cases (18.8%) experienced death within 28 days. Eighteen of the 57 variables 
were selected for the model construction algorithm for model construction. Among 
the ML models considered, the RF model emerged as the optimal model achieving 
the accuracy, F1-score, and AUC values of 0.821, 0.596, and 0.864, respectively. 
The net benefit of the model surpassed other models at 16%-22% threshold 
probabilities based on decision curve analysis. According to the importance of 
features in the RF model, red blood cell distribution width, blood urea 
nitrogen, Simplified Acute Physiology Score II, Sequential Organ Failure 
Assessment, and white blood cell count were highlighted as the five most 
influential variables.
CONCLUSIONS: We developed ML models to predict 28-day all-cause mortality in HF 
patients associated with CDI in the ICU, which are more effective than the 
conventional LR model. The RF model has the best performance among all the ML 
models employed. It may be useful to help clinicians identify high-risk HF 
patients with CDI.

BACKGROUND: Acetaminophen serves as a standard antipyretic and analgesic agent 
in the intensive care unit (ICU). However, the association between its 
administration and acute kidney injury (AKI) among critically ill patients 
remains controversial, particularly lacking research in patients with 
Clostridioides difficile infection (CDI). Our aim was to explore the potential 
relationship between early acetaminophen administration and AKI in critically 
ill patients with concurrent CDI.
METHODS: Using data from the Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care (MIMIC) 
IV version 2.2 database, we performed a retrospective cohort study. AKI within 7 
days of ICU admission was the main outcome that was measured. We utilized 
multivariable logistic regression models adjusted for potential confounders 
based on statistical significance and clinical relevance, to investigate the 
association between acetaminophen exposure and the risk of AKI in patients with 
CDI. Additionally, subgroup analyses and sensitivity analysis were conducted to 
assess the robustness of our primary findings.
RESULTS: The average age of 984 participants was 66.8 ± 16.5 years, and 52.7% 
(519) were male. The overall proportion of patients who developed AKI was 75.4% 
(742/984). In patients without and with acetaminophen administration, AKI rates 
were 79.8% (380/476) and 71.3% (362/508), respectively. Compared to the 
non-acetaminophen administration group, the risk of AKI was lower in the 
acetaminophen administration group (absolute risk difference: -8.5%, 95%CI: 
-13.83%∼-3.17%, P < 0.01).After adjusting for potential confounders, 
acetaminophen administration was associated with a 32% reduction in the risk of 
AKI (OR = 0.68, 95%CI:0.48∼0.96, P = 0.027).
CONCLUSION: Our study suggests that early acetaminophen administration may offer 
renal protection by reducing the risk of AKI in critically ill patients with 
CDI. Prospective, multicenter randomized controlled studies are needed to verify 
this finding.

OBJECTIVE: Bacterial infections (BIs) are common, costly, and potentially 
life-threatening in critically ill patients. Patients with suspected BIs may 
require empiric multidrug antibiotic regimens and therefore potentially be 
exposed to prolonged and unnecessary antibiotics. We previously developed a BI 
risk model to augment practices and help shorten the duration of unnecessary 
antibiotics to improve patient outcomes. Here, we have performed a 
transportability assessment of this BI risk model in 2 tertiary intensive care 
unit (ICU) settings and a community ICU setting. We additionally explored how 
simple multisite learning techniques impacted model transportability.
METHODS: Patients suspected of having a community-acquired BI were identified in 
3 datasets: Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care III (MIMIC), 
Northwestern Medicine Tertiary (NM-T) ICUs, and NM "community-based" ICUs. ICU 
encounters from MIMIC and NM-T datasets were split into 70/30 train and test 
sets. Models developed on training data were evaluated against the NM-T and 
MIMIC test sets, as well as NM community validation data.
RESULTS: During internal validations, models achieved AUROCs of 0.78 (MIMIC) and 
0.81 (NM-T) and were well calibrated. In the external community ICU validation, 
the NM-T model had robust transportability (AUROC 0.81) while the MIMIC model 
transported less favorably (AUROC 0.74), likely due to case-mix differences. 
Multisite learning provided no significant discrimination benefit in internal 
validation studies but offered more stability during transport across all 
evaluation datasets.
DISCUSSION: These results suggest that our BI risk models maintain predictive 
utility when transported to external cohorts.
CONCLUSION: Our findings highlight the importance of performing external model 
validation on myriad clinically relevant populations prior to implementation.

Jiangbei District), Chongqing, China.

OBJECTIVES: The objective of this study was to investigate the association 
between the prognostic nutritional index (PNI) and the short-term outcomes in 
patients with community-acquired bacterial pneumonia (CABP).
DESIGN: This study employed a retrospective design, utilizing data from the 
Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care (MIMIC)-IV database.
PARTICIPANTS: 371 individuals from the MIMIC-IV database who were diagnosed with 
CABP.
PRIMARY AND SECONDARY OUTCOMES: The primary endpoint was 28-day all-cause 
mortality. The secondary endpoint was the length of stay (LOS) in the intensive 
care unit (ICU) and in hospital.
RESULTS: The area under the curve of PNI for predicting 28-day all-cause 
mortality is 0.702 (95% CI 0.630 to 0.775; p < 0.001). Patients were divided 
into two groups based on their PNI at admission: the low PNI (<35.75) group and 
the high PNI group (≥35.75). CABP patients with higher PNI presented a lower 
28-day all-cause mortality rate (adjusted HR: 0.53, 95% CI 0.28-0.98, 
p = 0.044). Moreover, a negative linear correlation was found between the PNI 
and short-term mortality rates via restricted cubic splines. Eventually, there 
was no difference in the LOS in the ICU or hospital between the two groups.
CONCLUSION: These findings suggest a negative correlation between the PNI at 
admission and the short-term mortality rate of CABP. PNI is helpful for early 
identification of high-risk patients.

University, Beijing, China.

AIM: To explore the predictive value of white blood cell to hemoglobin ratio 
(WHR) for 30-day mortality in patients with intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH).
METHODS: In this cohort study, 2,848 patients with ICH were identified in the 
Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care (MIMIC)-III and MIMIC-IV. Least 
absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) regression screened covariates 
of 30-day mortality of ICH patients. COX regression analysis was used to study 
the association of different levels of WHR, white blood cell (WBC), and 
hemoglobin (Hb) with 30-day mortality. The median follow-up time was 30 (20.28, 
30.00) days.
RESULTS: In total, 2,068 participants survived at the end of the follow-up. WHR 
was negatively correlated with the Glasgow Coma Score (GCS) (spearman 
correlation coefficient = -0.143, p < 0.001), and positively associated with the 
Sepsis-related Organ Failure Assessment (SOFA) score (spearman correlation 
coefficient = 0.156, p < 0.001), quick SOFA (qSOFA) score (spearman correlation 
coefficient = 0.156, p < 0.001), and Simplified Acute Physiology Score II 
(SAPS-II) (spearman correlation coefficient = 0.213, p < 0.001). After adjusting 
for confounders, WHR >0.833 (HR = 1.64, 95%CI: 1.39-1.92) and WBC >10.9 K/uL 
(HR = 1.49, 95%CI: 1.28-1.73) were associated with increased risk of 30-day 
mortality of patients with ICH. The area under the curve (AUC) value of the 
prediction model based on WHR and other predictors was 0.78 (95%CI: 0.77-0.79), 
which was higher than SAPSII (AUC = 0.75, 95%CI: 0.74-0.76), SOFA score 
(AUC = 0.69, 95%CI: 0.68-0.70) and GCS (AUC = 0.59, 95%CI: 0.57-0.60).
CONCLUSION: The level of WHR was associated with 30-day mortality in patients 
with severe ICH, and the WHR-based prediction model might provide a tool to 
quickly predict 30-day mortality in patients with ICH.

Inflammation may contribute to postoperative cardiac complications and 
ketorolac, an anti-inflammatory agent inhibiting cyclooxygenase (COX), shows 
promise in enhancing cardiac graft patency by suppressing endothelial cell 
proliferation in animal studies. However, the safety of postoperative ketorolac 
use remains controversial. This study investigates the association between early 
ketorolac application and complications following cardiac surgery. Data from the 
Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care-IV (MIMIC-IV) database fueled this 
retrospective cohort study. The primary outcome is a composite of mortality, 
pulmonary insufficiency, severe acute kidney injury (AKI), hemorrhage or 
hematoma, infection, cardiogenic shock, and cerebrovascular infarction 
postcardiac surgery. Propensity score matching (PSM; 1:1 match, caliper 0.2), 
multivariate logistic regression, interaction stratification analysis, pairwise 
algorithmic, and overlap weight model analyses were employed. Following 
inclusion and exclusion criteria, 7143 patients who underwent valvular surgery 
or coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) were included. PSM created a balanced 
cohort of 3270 individuals (1635 in the ketorolac group). The matched cohort 
exhibited an 8.1% overall rate of postoperative complications, with a lower 
composite outcome rate in patients receiving ketorolac within 48 h of surgery 
compared with those without (PSM, OR 0.70 [95% CI, 0.54-0.90]). Consistent 
associations were observed in total cohort analyses, sensitivity, and subgroup 
analyses. Early ketorolac use within 48 h post-CABG or valvular procedures in 
adults is independently associated with a lower incidence of composite 
postoperative adverse events. Prospective trials are warranted to assess 
causality.

AIMS: This study aimed to establish a phenotypic clustering model for critically 
ill patients with comorbid type 2 diabetes mellitus (CIP T2DM), define distinct 
subtypes, and analyze differences in clinical characteristics and treatment 
response.
METHODS: Patients from the Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care IV 
(MIMIC-IV) database were phenotyped based on demographic, physiological, and 
biochemical parameters, along with critically ill scores, using a consensus 
clustering algorithm. Subtype validity was assessed using the eICU Collaborative 
Research Database (eICU). High-frequency combination drug regimens were then 
extracted to reveal therapeutic heterogeneity among subtypes.
RESULTS: Three subtypes were identified in the MIMIC-IV cohort (n = 6349). The 
in-group proportions of 0.957, 0.898, and 0.836 in the eICU cohort (n = 1425) 
show high consistency. These three subtypes are: a) CIP T2DM with severe 
infection (CIP T2DM-SI) with a mortality of 16.7 % and a post-medication blood 
glucose (PMBG, first measured 24 h after medication administration) of 8.25 
mmol/L; b) CIP T2DM with organ failure (CIP T2DM-OF) with 18.6 % mortality and 
8.03 mmol/L PMBG; and c) CIP T2DM under monitoring for continuous observation 
and evaluation (CIP T2DM-UM) with 8.87 % mortality and 6.98 mmol/L PMBG. 
Moreover, the three subtypes showed different in-hospital mortality risks under 
the same medication regimen.
CONCLUSIONS: Three phenotypes were identified in CIP T2DM, showing significant 
heterogeneity in clinical characteristics and prognosis. Personalized 
interventions for these subtypes may help reduce adverse events and guide 
precise treatment in practice.

OBJECTIVES: The purpose of this study was to develop and validate a nomogram for 
the prediction of pulmonary infections in elderly patients with intracerebral 
hemorrhage (ICH) during hospitalization in the intensive care unit (ICU).
METHODS: A total of 1183 elderly patients diagnosed with ICH were included from 
the Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care-IV (MIMIC-IV) database and 
randomly grouped into training (n=831) and validation (n=352) cohorts. Candidate 
predictors were identified using the least absolute shrinkage and selection 
operator (LASSO) regression. Meanwhile, the variables derived from the LASSO 
regression were included in the multivariate logistic regression analysis, the 
variables with P < 0.05 were included in the final model and the nomogram was 
constructed. The discriminatory ability was assessed by plotting the receiver 
operating curve (ROC) and calculating the area under the curve (AUC). The 
Performance of the model was assessed by calibration plots and the 
Hosmer-Lemeshow goodness-of-fit test (HL test). In addition, clinical decision 
curves assess the net clinical benefit.
RESULTS: The nomogram included chronic lung disease, dysphagia, mechanical 
ventilation, use of antibiotics, Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS), Logical Organ 
Dysfunction System (LODS), blood oxygen saturation (SpO2), white blood cell 
count (WBC) and prothrombin time (PT). The AUC of the predictive model was 0.905 
(95 % CI: 0.877, 0.764) in the training cohort and 0.888 (95 % CI: 0.754, 0.838) 
in the validation cohort, which showed satisfactory discriminative ability. 
Second, the nomogram showed good calibration. Decision curve analysis showed 
that the predictive nomogram was clinically useful.
CONCLUSION: A prediction model for predicting pulmonary infections in elderly 
ICH patients was constructed. The model can help clinicians to identify 
high-risk patients as soon as possible and prevent the occurrence of pulmonary 
infections.

BACKGROUND: The fibrinogen-to-albumin ratio (FAR), a novel inflammatory 
biomarker, is strongly associated with the incidence of sepsis. Nonetheless, 
there is a lack of research regarding the FAR and prognosis in individuals with 
septic acute kidney injury (SAKI). The aim of this study was to assess the 
correlation between the FAR upon intensive care unit (ICU) admission and overall 
mortality in patients with SAKI.
METHODS: All patient information was retrieved from the Medical Information Mart 
for Intensive Care-IV (MIMIC-IV) database. All patients were divided into four 
distinct categories according to the FAR. The primary endpoints for this study 
were the 30-day and 365-day all-cause death rates, whereas the secondary 
endpoints were the 60-day, 90-day and 180-day all-cause death rates. The FAR was 
quartile, and the Kaplan-Meier curve was used to evaluate the outcomes across 
the groups. To evaluate the correlation between the FAR and outcomes, we used a 
Cox proportional hazards regression model and restricted cubic splines (RCSs).
RESULTS: Among the 6208 participants, the average age was 65 years, with 3659 
(58.94%) identified as male. Patients exhibiting elevated FAR values 
demonstrated an increased risk of all-cause mortality at 30, 60, 90, 180 and 
365 days, as evidenced by the Kaplan-Meier curves (log-rank P < .001). SAKI 
patients with elevated FAR values had a greater risk of all-cause mortality at 
30, 60, 90, 180 and 365 days than did those with lower FAR values, as 
demonstrated by Cox proportional hazards regression analysis. With inflection 
points at 35.14 for 30-day mortality and 34.8 for 365-day mortality, the RCS 
analysis revealed that the FAR and all-cause mortality were related in an 
inverted N-type pattern. In instances where FAR levels were below 35.14 mg/g, a 
reduction of 1 unit in the FAR correlated with a 6.5% increase in the risk of 
30-day all-cause mortality [hazard ratio (HR) 0.935; 95% confidence interval 
(CI) 0.923, 0.948]. In instances where FAR levels were below 34.8 mg/g, a 
reduction of 1 unit in the FAR correlated with a 6.2% increase in the risk of 
365-day all-cause mortality (HR 0.938; 95% CI 0.927, 0.949).
CONCLUSION: In severely ill patients with SAKI, elevated FAR levels are strongly 
correlated with an increased risk of all-cause mortality at 30, 60, 90, 180 and 
365 days. FAR may serve as a reliable metric for assessing and managing patients 
with SAKI in the ICU.

INTRODUCTION: Fresh frozen plasma (FFP) transfusion in the intensive care unit 
(ICU) is commonly used to treat coagulopathy and bleeding in cardiac surgery, 
despite suggestion that it may increase the risk of morbidity and mortality 
through mechanisms such as fluid overload and infection.
METHODS: We retrospectively studied consecutive adults undergoing cardiac 
surgery from the Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care III and IV 
databases. We applied propensity score matching to investigate the independent 
association of within-ICU FFP transfusion with mortality and other key clinical 
outcomes.
RESULTS: Of our 12,043 adults who met inclusion criteria, 1585 (13.2%) received 
perioperative FFP with a median of 2.48 units per recipient (interquartile range 
[IQR]: 2.04, 4.33) at a median time of 1.83 h (IQR: 0.75, 3.75) after ICU 
admission. After propensity matching of 952 FFP recipients to 952 controls, we 
found no significant association between FFP use and hospital mortality (odds 
ratio (OR): 1.58; 99% confidence interval (CI): 0.57, 3.71), suspected infection 
(OR: 0.72; 99% CI: 0.49, 1.08), or acute kidney injury (OR: 1.23; 99% CI: 0.91, 
1.67). However, FFP was associated with increased days in hospital (adjusted 
mean difference (AMD): 1.28; 99% CI: 0.27, 2.41; p = .0050), days in intensive 
care (AMD: 1.28; 99% CI: 0.27, 2.28; p = .0011), and chest tube output in 
millilitres up to 8 h after transfusion (AMD: 92.98; 99% CI: 52.22, 133.74; p < 
.0001).
CONCLUSIONS: After propensity matching, FFP transfusion was not associated with 
increased hospital mortality, but was associated with increased length of stay 
and no decrease in bleeding in the early post-transfusion period.

BACKGROUND: Vitamin D, an essential fat-soluble micronutrient, exerts diverse 
physiological effects including the regulation of calcium ion homeostasis, 
modulation of immune response, and enhancement of resistance against infectious 
pathogens. Empirical investigations have elucidated an association between 
inadequate levels of vitamin D and adverse clinical outcomes in critically ill 
cohorts, with a noteworthy prevalence of vitamin D deficiency observed among 
patients afflicted with acute kidney injury (AKI). In the context of this 
retrospective inquiry, our aim was to assess the potential correlation between 
vitamin D supplementation administered during admission to the intensive care 
unit (ICU) and the improvement of outcomes specifically in cases of severe AKI.
METHODS: This study utilized data from the Medical Information Mart for 
Intensive Care IV (MIMIC-IV), a repository of ICU patient records from Beth 
Israel Deaconess Medical Center (BIDMC) in the United States. We focused on 
patients diagnosed with epsis-associated acute kidney injury (SA-AKI), dividing 
them into those who received vitamin D supplementation during their ICU 
admission and those who did not. Our primary analysis evaluated in-hospital 
mortality using various statistical methods, such as Kaplan-Meier survival 
curves, Cox proportional hazards regression models, and subgroup analyses. To 
enhance the robustness of our findings, we used propensity score matching (PSM) 
to reduce potential biases. Secondary outcomes included 28-day, 90-day mortality 
rates and norepinephrine-free days at 28 days.
RESULTS: In this investigation, a cohort of 11,896 individuals diagnosed with 
SA-AKI was studied. Among them, 2,724 patients received vitamin D 
supplementation (the vitamin D group) while 9,172 did not (the no-vitamin D 
group). Kaplan-Meier survival analysis indicated a significant difference in 
survival probabilities between the two cohorts. Upon adjusting for potential 
confounders using Cox regression modeling, a notably decreased risk of 
hospitalization and ICU mortality was observed in the vitamin D group compared 
to the no-vitamin D group, with an adjusted risk ratio for in-hospital mortality 
of 0.56 (95% CI: 0.5-0.63). These findings were consistent following PSM and 
subsequent adjustments for propensity score, pairwise algorithm (PA), and 
overlapping weights (OW) analyses, yielding hazard ratios ranging from 0.53 to 
0.59, all with p-values <0.001. Notably, E-value analyses underscored the 
robustness of these results against potential unmeasured confounders.
CONCLUSION: This study suggests that vitamin D supplementation may be associated 
with a reduced in-hospital mortality rate among SA-AKI patients in the ICU. 
Furthermore, the 28-day, 90-day mortality rates and norepinephrine days were 
significantly reduced in the group receiving vitamin D supplementation.

BACKGROUND: Aspiration pneumonia (AP) is a common complication in the intensive 
care unit (ICU), which is associated with significantly increased morbidity and 
mortality and has a significant impact on patient prognosis. Antibiotics are 
commonly used in the clinical treatment of AP. However, the prognostic impact of 
antibiotics on patients with AP has not been adequately characterized. The 
purpose of this study is to illustrate the relationship between the use of 
antibiotics and in-hospital mortality of AP patients, as well as to analyze the 
effects of different antibiotic treatment regimens on the prognosis of the 
patients, and to further understand the distribution of pathogens and drug 
resistance in AP patients, so as to provide guidance information for the 
rational use of medication for patients in the clinic.
METHODS: Clinical data of AP patients were extracted from the MIMIC-IV database. 
Statistical methods included multivariate logistic regression, propensity score 
matching (PSM), and inverse probability weighting (IPW) based on propensity 
scores to ensure the robustness of the findings. In addition, the 
characteristics of the medications used by patients with AP were described using 
statistical graphs and tables.
RESULTS: A total of 4132 patients with AP were included. In-hospital mortality 
was significantly lower in the group using antibiotics compared to the group not 
using antibiotics (odds ratio [OR] = 0.44, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.27- 
0.71, P = 0.001). Furthermore, in the group using mechanical ventilation (MV), 
antibiotics use significantly reduced in-hospital mortality (OR = 0.30, 95% CI 
0.15-0.57, P < 0.001). Vancomycin and cephalosporins are the most commonly used 
antibiotics to treat AP. Specifically, vancomycin in combination with 
piperacillin-tazobactam was used most frequently with 396 cases. The highest 
survival rate (97.6\%) was observed in patients treated with levofloxacin 
combined with metronidazole. Additionally, vancomycin combined with 
piperacillin-tazobactam had many inflammation related features that differed 
significantly from those in patients who did not receive medication.
CONCLUSIONS: Antibiotics use is closely associated with lower in-hospital 
mortality in ICU patients with AP. Moreover, understanding antibiotics use, the 
composition of pathogenic bacteria, and the rates of drug resistance in patients 
with AP can aid in disease prevention and prompt infection control.

Background: Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) is a common infection 
complication in intensive care units (ICU). It not only prolongs mechanical 
ventilation and ICU and hospital stays, but also increases medical costs and 
increases the mortality risk of patients. Although many studies have found that 
thiamine supplementation in critically ill patients may improve prognoses, there 
is still no research or evidence that thiamine supplementation is beneficial for 
patients with VAP. The purpose of this study was to determine the association 
between thiamine and the prognoses of patients with VAP. Methods: This study 
retrospectively collected all patients with VAP in the ICU from the Medical 
Information Mart for Intensive Care-IV database. The outcomes were ICU and 
in-hospital mortality. Patients were divided into the no-thiamine and thiamine 
groups depending upon whether or not they had received supplementation. 
Associations between thiamine and the outcomes were tested using Kaplan-Meier 
(KM) survival curves and Cox proportional-hazards regression models. The 
statistical methods of propensity-score matching (PSM) and inverse probability 
weighting (IPW) based on the XGBoost model were also applied to ensure the 
robustness of our findings. Results: The study finally included 1,654 patients 
with VAP, comprising 1,151 and 503 in the no-thiamine and thiamine groups, 
respectively. The KM survival curves indicated that the survival probability 
differed significantly between the two groups. After multivariate COX regression 
adjusted for confounding factors, the hazard ratio (95% confidence interval) 
values for ICU and in-hospital mortality in the thiamine group were 0.57 (0.37, 
0.88) and 0.64 (0.45, 0.92), respectively. Moreover, the results of the PSM and 
IPW analyses were consistent with the original population. Conclusion: Thiamine 
supplementation may reduce ICU and in-hospital mortality in patients with VAP in 
the ICU. Thiamine is an inexpensive and safe drug, and so further clinical 
trials should be conducted to provide more-solid evidence on whether it improves 
the prognosis of patients with VAP.

BACKGROUND: Acute kidney injury (AKI) is associated with increased mortality in 
critically ill patients. Due to differences in the etiology and 
pathophysiological mechanism, the current AKI criteria put it an embarrassment 
to evaluate clinical therapy and prognosis.
OBJECTIVE: We aimed to identify subphenotypes based on routinely collected 
clinical data to expose the unique pathophysiologic patterns.
METHODS: A retrospective study was conducted based on the Medical Information 
Mart for Intensive Care IV (MIMIC-IV) and the eICU Collaborative Research 
Database (eICU-CRD), and a deep clustering approach was conducted to derive 
subphenotypes. We conducted further analysis to uncover the underlying clinical 
patterns and interpret the subphenotype derivation.
RESULTS: We studied 14,189 and 19,382 patients with AKI within 48 h of ICU 
admission in the two datasets, respectively. Through our approach, we identified 
seven distinct AKI subphenotypes with mortality heterogeneity in each cohort. 
These subphenotypes displayed significant variations in demographics, 
comorbidities, levels of laboratory measurements, and survival patterns. 
Notably, the subphenotypes could not be effectively characterized using the 
Kidney Disease: Improving Global Outcomes (KDIGO) criteria alone. Therefore, we 
uncovered the unique underlying characteristics of each subphenotype through 
model-based interpretation. To assess the usability of the subphenotypes, we 
conducted an evaluation, which yielded a micro-Area Under the Receiver Operating 
Characteristic (AUROC) of 0.81 in the single-center cohort and 0.83 in the 
multi-center cohort within 48-hour of admission.
CONCLUSION: We derived highly characteristic, interpretable, and usable AKI 
subphenotypes that exhibited superior prognostic values.

BACKGROUND: Invasive candidiasis is the most common hospital-acquired fungal 
infection in intensive care units (ICU). The Geriatric Nutritional Risk Index 
(GNRI) score was developed to evaluate the nutritional status of elderly adults. 
We aimed to assess the association between the GNRI score and the risk of 
invasive candidiasis in elderly patients admitted to ICU.
METHODS: Hospitalization information of elderly patients with invasive 
candidiasis was collected retrospectively from Medical Information Mart for 
Intensive Care (MIMIC) IV and MIMIC-III Clinical Database CareVue subset from 
2001 to 2019. The main outcome of this study was the diagnosis of invasive 
candidiasis in patients. We employed a multivariable Cox regression and 
propensity score matching to balance the influence of confounding factors on the 
outcome. Furthermore, we conducted sensitivity analyses by categorizing the GNRI 
into classes based on thresholds of 98, 92, and 81.
RESULTS: A total of 6739 patients were included in the study, among whom 134 
individuals (2%) were diagnosed with invasive candidiasis. The GNRI scores of 
patients with invasive candidiasis upon admission to the ICU were significantly 
lower, measuring 88.67 [79.26-98.27], compared to the control group with a score 
of 99.36 [87.98-110.45] (P < 0.001). The results of the multivariable Cox 
regression analysis demonstrated a strong association between higher GNRI scores 
and a decreased risk of invasive candidiasis infection (HR: 0.98, 95% CI: 
0.97-0.99, P = 0.002). Consistently, similar results were obtained when 
analyzing the propensity score-matched cohort (HR: 0.99, 95% CI: 0.98-1, 
P = 0.028). Sensitivity analyses further confirmed a significantly increased 
risk of invasive candidiasis infection with lower GNRI scores. Specifically, the 
following associations were observed: GNRI ≤ 98 (HR: 1.83, 95% CI: 1.23-2.72, 
P = 0.003), GNRI ≤ 92 (HR: 1.68, 95% CI: 1.17-2.4, P = 0.005), 82 ≤ GNRI ≤ 92 
(HR: 1.63, 95% CI: 1.01-2.64, P = 0.046), GNRI ≤ 81 (HR: 2.31, 95% CI: 
1.44-3.69, P < 0.001).
CONCLUSIONS: Lower GNRI score was significantly associated with an increased 
risk of invasive candidiasis in elderly patients in ICU. Further research is 
needed to validate whether improving nutrition can prevent invasive candidiasis.

Background: Mechanically ventilated patients are susceptible to nosocomial 
infections such as ventilator-associated pneumonia. To treat ventilated patients 
with suspected infection, clinicians select appropriate antibiotics. However, 
decision-making regarding the use of antibiotics for methicillin-resistant 
Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) is challenging, because of the lack of 
evidence-supported criteria. This study aims to derive a machine learning model 
to predict MRSA as a possible pathogen responsible for infection in mechanically 
ventilated patients. Methods: Data were collected from the Medical Information 
Mart for Intensive Care (MIMIC)-IV database (an openly available database of 
patients treated at the Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center in the period 
2008-2019). Of 26,409 mechanically ventilated patients, 809 were screened for 
MRSA during the mechanical ventilation period and included in the study. The 
outcome was positivity to MRSA on screening, which was highly imbalanced in the 
dataset, with 93.9% positive outcomes. Therefore, after dividing the dataset 
into a training set (n = 566) and a test set (n = 243) for validation by 
stratified random sampling with a 7:3 allocation ratio, synthetic datasets with 
50% positive outcomes were created by synthetic minority over-sampling for both 
sets individually (synthetic training set: n = 1,064; synthetic test set: n = 
456). Using these synthetic datasets, we trained and validated an XGBoost 
machine learning model using 28 predictor variables for outcome prediction. 
Model performance was evaluated by area under the receiver operating 
characteristic (AUROC), sensitivity, specificity, and other statistical 
measurements. Feature importance was computed by the Gini method. Results: In 
validation, the XGBoost model demonstrated reliable outcome prediction with an 
AUROC value of 0.89 [95% confidence interval (CI): 0.83-0.95]. The model showed 
a high sensitivity of 0.98 [CI: 0.95-0.99], but a low specificity of 0.47 [CI: 
0.41-0.54] and a positive predictive value of 0.65 [CI: 0.62-0.68]. Important 
predictor variables included admission from the emergency department, insertion 
of arterial lines, prior quinolone use, hemodialysis, and admission to a 
surgical intensive care unit. Conclusions: We were able to develop an effective 
machine learning model to predict positive MRSA screening during mechanical 
ventilation using synthetic datasets, thus encouraging further research to 
develop a clinically relevant machine learning model for antibiotics 
stewardship.

PURPOSE: This study aims to develop and validate a prediction model for delirium 
in elderly ICU patients and help clinicians identify high-risk patients at the 
early stage.
METHODS: Patients admitted to ICU for at least 24 h and using the Confusion 
Assessment Method for the Intensive Care Unit (CAM-ICU) in the Medical 
Information Mart for Intensive Care-IV (MIMIC-IV) database (76,943 ICU stays 
from 2008 to 2019) were considered. Patients with a positive delirium test in 
the first 24 h and under 65 years of age were excluded. Two prediction models, 
machine learning extreme gradient boosting (XGBoost) and logistic regression 
(LR) model, were developed and validated to predict the onset of delirium.
RESULTS: Of the 18,760 patients included in the analysis, 3463(18.5%) were 
delirium positive. A total of 22 significant predictors were selected by LASSO 
regression. The XGBoost model demonstrated superior performance over the LR 
model, with the Area Under the Receiver Operating Characteristic (AUC) values of 
0.853 (95% confidence interval [CI] 0.846-0.861) and 0.831 (95% CI 0.815-0.847) 
in the training and testing datasets, respectively. Moreover, the XGBoost model 
outperformed the LR model in both calibration and clinical utility. The top five 
predictors associated with the onset of delirium were sequential organ failure 
assessment (SOFA), infection, minimum platelets, maximum systolic blood pressure 
(SBP), and maximum temperature.
CONCLUSION: The XGBoost model demonstrated good predictive performance for 
delirium among elderly ICU patients, thus assisting clinicians in identifying 
high-risk patients at the early stage and implementing targeted interventions to 
improve outcome.

Background: Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) is the most widespread and 
life-threatening nosocomial infection in intensive care units (ICUs). The 
duration of antibiotic use is a good predictor of prognosis in patients with 
VAP, but the ideal duration of antibiotic therapy for VAP in critically ill 
patients has not been confirmed. Research is therefore needed into the optimal 
duration of antibiotic use and its impact on VAP. Methods: The Medical 
Information Mart for Intensive Care database included 1,609 patients with VAP. 
Chi-square or Student's t-tests were used to compare groups, and Cox regression 
analysis was used to investigate the factors influencing the prognoses of 
patients with VAP. Nonlinear tests were performed on antibiotic use lasting <7, 
7-10, and >10 days. Significant factors were included in the model for 
sensitivity analysis. For the subgroup analyses, the body mass indexes (BMIs) of 
patients were separated into BMI <30 kg/m2 and BMI ≥30 kg/m2, with the criterion 
of statistical significance set at p < 0.05. Restricted cubic splines were used 
to analyze the relationship between antibiotic use duration and mortality risk 
in patients with VAP. Results: In patients with VAP, the effects of antibiotic 
use duration on the outcomes were nonlinear. Antibiotic use for 7-10 days in 
models 1-3 increased the risk of antibiotic use by 2.6020-, 2.1642-, and 
2.3263-fold relative to for >10 days, respectively. The risks in models 1-3 for 
<7 days were 2.6510-, 1.9933-, and 2.5151-fold higher than those in models with 
>10 days of antibiotic use, respectively. These results were robust across the 
analyses. Conclusions: The duration of antibiotic treatment had a nonlinear 
effect on the prognosis of patients with VAP. Antibiotic use durations of 
<7 days and 7-10 days both presented risks, and the appropriate duration of 
antibiotic use can ensure the good prognosis of patients with VAP.

BACKGROUND: Acute kidney disease (AKD) affects more than half of critically ill 
elderly patients with acute kidney injury (AKI), which leads to worse short-term 
outcomes.
OBJECTIVE: We aimed to establish 2 machine learning models to predict the risk 
and prognosis of AKD in the elderly and to deploy the models as online apps.
METHODS: Data on elderly patients with AKI (n=3542) and AKD (n=2661) from the 
Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care IV (MIMIC-IV) database were used to 
develop 2 models for predicting the AKD risk and in-hospital mortality, 
respectively. Data collected from Xiangya Hospital of Central South University 
were for external validation. A bootstrap method was used for internal 
validation to obtain relatively stable results. We extracted the indicators 
within 24 hours of the first diagnosis of AKI and the fluctuation range of some 
indicators, namely delta (day 3 after AKI minus day 1), as features. Six machine 
learning algorithms were used for modeling; the area under the receiver 
operating characteristic curve (AUROC), decision curve analysis, and calibration 
curve for evaluating; Shapley additive explanation (SHAP) analysis for visually 
interpreting; and the Heroku platform for deploying the best-performing models 
as web-based apps.
RESULTS: For the model of predicting the risk of AKD in elderly patients with 
AKI during hospitalization, the Light Gradient Boosting Machine (LightGBM) 
showed the best overall performance in the training (AUROC=0.844, 95% CI 
0.831-0.857), internal validation (AUROC=0.853, 95% CI 0.841-0.865), and 
external (AUROC=0.755, 95% CI 0.699-0.811) cohorts. In addition, LightGBM 
performed well for the AKD prognostic prediction in the training (AUROC=0.861, 
95% CI 0.843-0.878), internal validation (AUROC=0.868, 95% CI 0.851-0.885), and 
external (AUROC=0.746, 95% CI 0.673-0.820) cohorts. The models deployed as 
online prediction apps allowed users to predict and provide feedback to submit 
new data for model iteration. In the importance ranking and correlation 
visualization of the model's top 10 influencing factors conducted based on the 
SHAP value, partial dependence plots revealed the optimal cutoff of some 
interventionable indicators. The top 5 factors predicting the risk of AKD were 
creatinine on day 3, sepsis, delta blood urea nitrogen (BUN), diastolic blood 
pressure (DBP), and heart rate, while the top 5 factors determining in-hospital 
mortality were age, BUN on day 1, vasopressor use, BUN on day 3, and partial 
pressure of carbon dioxide (PaCO2).
CONCLUSIONS: We developed and validated 2 online apps for predicting the risk of 
AKD and its prognostic mortality in elderly patients, respectively. The top 10 
factors that influenced the AKD risk and mortality during hospitalization were 
identified and explained visually, which might provide useful applications for 
intelligent management and suggestions for future prospective research.

BACKGROUND: Analgesia and sedation therapy are commonly used for critically ill 
patients, especially mechanically ventilated patients. From the initial 
nonsedation programs to deep sedation and then to on-demand sedation, the 
understanding of sedation therapy continues to deepen. However, according to 
different patient's condition, understanding the individual patient's depth of 
sedation needs remains unclear.
METHODS: The public open source critical illness database Medical Information 
Mart for Intensive Care III was used in this study. Latent profile analysis was 
used as a clustering method to classify mechanically ventilated patients based 
on 36 variables. Principal component analysis dimensionality reduction was used 
to select the most influential variables. The ROC curve was used to evaluate the 
classification accuracy of the model.
RESULTS: Based on 36 characteristic variables, we divided patients undergoing 
mechanical ventilation and sedation and analgesia into two categories with 
different mortality rates, then further reduced the dimensionality of the data 
and obtained the 9 variables that had the greatest impact on classification, 
most of which were ventilator parameters. According to the Richmond-ASS scores, 
the two phenotypes of patients had different degrees of sedation and analgesia, 
and the corresponding ventilator parameters were also significantly different. 
We divided the validation cohort into three different levels of sedation, 
revealing that patients with high ventilator conditions needed a deeper level of 
sedation, while patients with low ventilator conditions required reduction in 
the depth of sedation as soon as possible to promote recovery and avoid 
reinjury.
CONCLUSION: Through latent profile analysis and dimensionality reduction, we 
divided patients treated with mechanical ventilation and sedation and analgesia 
into two categories with different mortalities and obtained 9 variables that had 
the greatest impact on classification, which revealed that the depth of sedation 
was limited by the condition of the respiratory system.

BACKGROUND: There are few widely accepted and operationally feasible models for 
predicting the mortality risk of patients in surgical intensive care unit 
(SICU). Although serum anion gap (AG) is known to be correlated with severe 
metabolic acidosis, no investigations have been reported about the association 
between AG level and the outcome during hospitalization in SICU. This study 
aimed to explore the predictive power of AG for 90-day all-cause mortality in 
SICU.
METHODS: Data of the eligible patients in SICU from 2008 to 2019 was obtained 
from the Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care IV version 2.0 (MIMIC-IV 
v2.0) database. Baseline clinical data of the selected patients was compared in 
different groups stratified by the outcome during their admission via univariate 
analysis. Restricted cubic spline (RCS) was drawn to confirm the relationship of 
AG and the short-term mortality. Kaplan-Meier survival curve was plotted in 
different AG level groups. Univariate and multivariate Cox analyses were 
performed, and Cox proportional-hazards models were built to investigate an 
independent role of AG to predict 90-day all-cause mortality risk in SICU. 
Receiver operating characteristics (ROC) curves analysis was performed to 
evaluate the predictive value of AG on the 90-day prognosis of patients.
RESULTS: A total of 6,395 patients were enrolled in this study and the 90-day 
all-cause mortality rate was 18.17%. Univariate analysis showed that elevated 
serum AG was associated with higher mortality (P < 0.001). RCS analysis 
indicated a positively linear relationship between serum AG and the risk of 
90-day all-cause mortality in SICU (χ2 = 4.730, P = 0.193). Kaplan-Meier 
survival analysis demonstrated that low-AG group (with a cutoff value of 14.10 
mmol/L) had a significantly higher cumulative survival rate than the counterpart 
of high-AG group (χ2 = 96.370, P < 0.001). Cox proportional-hazards models were 
constructed and confirmed the independent predictive role of AG in 90-day 
all-cause mortality risk in SICU after adjusting for 23 confounding factors 
gradually (HR 1.423, 1.246-1.625, P < 0.001). In the further subgroup analyses, 
a significant interaction was confirmed between AG and sepsis as well as surgery 
on the risk for the 90-day mortality. The ROC curve showed that the optimal 
cut-off value of AG for predicting 90-day mortality was 14.89 with sensitivity 
of 60.7% and specificity of 54.8%. The area under curve (AUC) was 0.602. When 
combined with SOFA score, the AUC of AG for predicting 90-day prognosis was 
0.710, with a sensitivity and specificity of 70% and 62.5% respectively.
CONCLUSIONS: Elevated AG (≥ 14.10 mmol/L) is an independent risk factor for 
predicting severe conditions and poor prognosis of critical ill surgical 
patients.

OBJECTIVE: To study the influence of time-dependent acute physiology and chronic 
health evaluation II (APACHE II) score on 14-day death risk in patients with 
severe stroke, and to provide reference for clinical diagnosis and treatment.
METHODS: Data of 3 229 patients with severe stroke were enrolled from Medical 
Information Mart for Intensive Care-III (MIMIC-III). According to the main types 
of stroke, the patients were divided into subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH), 
intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH), ischemic stroke (IS) and other groups. According 
to age, patients were divided into > 60 years old and ≤ 60 years old subgroups. 
According to the baseline of sequential organ failure assessment (SOFA) score, 
they were divided into subgroups of > 3 and ≤ 3. The daily measured values of 
APACHE II scores in each patient were recorded. And all-cause death within 14 
days after admission to intensive care unit (ICU) was used as the outcome index 
to obtain the survival status and survival time of patients. Joint models for 
longitudinal and time-to-event data were established to evaluate the effect of 
APACHE II score measured at multiple time points on the death risk of patients, 
and a subgroup analysis was performed.
RESULTS: Among the joint models, the one which include APACHE II score, and the 
interaction items between APACHE II and age showed the better fitting. Further 
analysis showed that APACHE II score was affected by age, gender, hospital 
admission, baseline SOFA score and smoking history. After controlling for these 
confounding factors, APACHE II score was significantly associated with 14-day 
all-cause death in patients with severe stroke [hazard ratio (HR) = 1.48, 95% 
confidence interval (95%CI) was 1.31-1.66, P < 0.001], which indicated that the 
risk of death increased by 48% (95%CI was 31%-66%) for each 1-point increase in 
APACHE II score. Subgroup analysis showed that for different types of severe 
stroke patients, APACHE II score had a greater impact on the risk of 14-day 
death in SAH patients (HR = 1.43, 95%CI was 1.10-1.85), but had a smaller impact 
on ICH and IS groups [HR (95%CI) was 1.37 (1.15-1.64) and 1.35 (1.06-1.71), 
respectively]. There was no significant difference in APACHE II score on the 
risk of 14-day death between the patients aged > 60 years old and those aged ≤ 
60 years old [HR (95%CI): 1.37 (1.08-1.72) vs. 1.35 (1.07-1.70), respectively]. 
Compared with patients with SOFA score > 3, APACHE II score had a greater impact 
on the risk of 14-day death in patients with SOFA score ≤ 3 [HR (95%CI): 1.40 
(1.16-1.70) vs. 1.34 (1.16-1.55)].
CONCLUSIONS: Time-dependent APACHE II score is an important indicator to 
evaluate the risk of death in patients with severe stroke.

BACKGROUND: This study aimed to develop and validate a model for mortality risk 
stratification of intensive care unit (ICU) patients with acute kidney injury 
(AKI) using the machine learning technique.
METHODS: Eligible data were extracted from the Medical Information Mart for 
Intensive Care (MIMIC-III) database. Calibration, discrimination, and risk 
classification for mortality prediction were evaluated using conventional 
scoring systems and the new algorithm. A 10-fold cross-validation was performed. 
The predictive models were externally validated using the eICU database and also 
patients treated at the Second People's Hospital of Shenzhen between January 
2015 to October 2018.
RESULTS: For the new model, the areas under the receiver operating 
characteristic curves (AUROCs) for mortality during hospitalization and at 28 
and 90 days after discharge were 0.91, 0.87, and 0.87, respectively, which were 
higher than for the Simplified Acute Physiology Score (SAPS II) and Sequential 
Organ Failure Assessment (SOFA). For external validation, the AUROC was 0.82 for 
in-hospital mortality, higher than SOFA, SAPS II, and Acute Physiology and 
Chronic Health Evaluation (APACHE) IV in the eICU database, but for the 28- and 
90-day mortality, the new model had AUROCs (0.79 and 0.80, respectively) similar 
to that of SAPS II in the SZ2 database. The reclassification indexes were 
superior for the new model compared with the conventional scoring systems.
CONCLUSIONS: The new risk stratification model shows high performance in 
predicting mortality in ICU patients with AKI.

BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: It is unclear whether blood pressure variability's 
(BPV) association with worse outcomes is unique to patients with stroke or a 
risk factor among all critically ill patients. We (1) determined whether BPV 
differed between patients with stroke and nonstroke patients, (2) examined BPV's 
associations with in-hospital death and favorable discharge destination in 
patients with stroke and nonstroke patients, and (3) assessed how minimum mean 
arterial pressure (MAP)-a correlate of illness severity and cerebral 
perfusion-affects these associations.
METHODS: This is a retrospective analysis of adult intensive care unit patients 
hospitalized between 2001 and 2012 from the Medical Information Mart for 
Intensive Care III database. Confounder-adjusted logistic regressions determined 
associations between BPV, measured as SD and average real variability (ARV), and 
(1) in-hospital death and (2) favorable discharge, with testing of minimum MAP 
for effect modification.
RESULTS: BPV was higher in patients with stroke (N = 2,248) compared with 
nonstroke patients (N = 9,085) (SD mean difference 2.3, 95% CI 2.1-2.6, p < 
0.01). After adjusting for minimum tertile of MAP and other confounders, higher 
SD remained significantly associated (p < 0.05) with higher odds of in-hospital 
death for patients with acute ischemic strokes (AISs, odds ratio [OR] 2.7, 95% 
CI 1.5-4.8), intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH, OR 2.6, 95% CI 1.6-4.3), 
subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH, OR 3.4, 95% CI 1.2-9.3), and pneumonia (OR 1.9, 
95% CI 1.1-3.3) and lower odds of favorable discharge destination in patients 
with ischemic stroke (OR 0.3, 95% CI 0.2-0.6) and ICH (OR 0.4, 95% CI 0.3-0.6). 
No interaction was found between minimum MAP tertile with SD (p > 0.05). Higher 
ARV was not significantly associated with increased risk of death in any 
condition when adjusting for illness severity but portended worse discharge 
destination in those with AIS (OR favorable discharge 0.4, 95% CI 0.3-0.7), ICH 
(OR favorable discharge 0.5, 95% CI 0.3-0.7), sepsis (OR favorable discharge 
0.8, 95% CI 0.6-1.0), and pneumonia (OR favorable discharge 0.5, 95% CI 
0.4-0.8).
DISCUSSION: BPV is higher and generally associated with worse outcomes among 
patients with stroke compared with nonstroke patients. BPV in patients with AIS 
and patients with ICH may be a marker of central autonomic network injury, 
although clinician-driven blood pressure goals likely contribute to the 
association between BPV and outcomes.

OBJECTIVE: To investigate the relationship between 1-hour lactate (1 h Lac) and 
30-day mortality in critical care patients in intensive care unit (ICU).
METHODS: A retrospective, observational cohort study was performed with adult 
critical patients (age ≥ 16 years old) having lactate records within 1 hour 
after ICU admission from Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care-III 
database (MIMIC-III). According to the 1 h Lac level, the patients were divided 
into three groups: < 2 mmol/L, 2-4 mmol/L, and > 4 mmol/L groups. The baseline 
characteristics were analyzed. Multivariable Logistic regression analysis was 
performed to assess the association between 1 h Lac and 30-day mortality. The 
receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve was used to analyze the predictive 
value of 1 h Lac for 30-day mortality, and Kaplan-Meier survival curve was 
performed according to the best cut-off value. In addition, sensitivity analysis 
was carried out for each classification variable.
RESULTS: A total of 3 969 ICU patients were included, with 673 died in 30 days, 
and the total mortality was 16.95%. There were 1 664, 1 588, 717 patients in Lac 
< 2 mmol/L, 2-4 mmol/L and > 4 mmol/L group, respectively. There were 
significant differences in age, ICU duration, ICU type, heart rate, leukocyte 
count, hemoglobin, creatinine, sequential organ failure score (SOFA), ventilator 
application, vasoactive drug use and main diagnosis among the three groups. 
Multivariable Logistic regression analysis showed that a 1 mmol/L increment in 
Lac was associated with 0.24 times higher risk of 30-day mortality [odds ratio 
(OR) = 1.24, 95% confidence interval (95%CI) was 1.19-1.29, P < 0.000 1]. ROC 
curve analysis showed that the area under ROC curve (AUC) of 1 h Lac for 
predicting 30-day mortality of severe patients was 0.694 (95%CI was 
0.669-0.718). The cut-off value was 3.35 mmol/L with sensitivity of 0.499 and 
specificity of 0.779, whilst positive likelihood ratio was 2.260, and negative 
likelihood ratio was 0.643. According to the cut-off value of 1 h Lac, the 
patients were divided into high lactate group (≥ 3.35 mmol/L) and low lactate 
group (< 3.35 mmol/L). In the two subgroups, 30-day mortality was 31.58% (336/1 
064) and 11.60% (337/2 905), respectively. The Kaplan-Meier survival curve 
showed that the 30-day cumulative survival rate of high lactate group was 
significantly lower than that of low lactate group (Log-rank test: χ2 = 247.72, 
P < 0.000 1). Multiple Logistic regression analysis showed that the 30-day 
mortality rate of high lactate group was 2.34 times that the level of low 
lactate group (OR = 2.34, 95%CI was 1.90-2.88, P < 0.000 1), after the 
adjustment of age, time of admission, type of ICU, hemoglobin, leukocyte count, 
use of vasopressor, use of ventilator and main diagnosis of patients. Stratified 
analysis showed that the relationship between 1 h Lac and 30-day mortality was 
stable.
CONCLUSIONS: 1 h Lac is associated with 30-day mortality in critical care 
patients. The risk of death was significantly increased in critically ill 
patients with 1 h Lac higher than 3.35 mmol/L.

BACKGROUND: Based on the high prevalence and fatality rates associated with 
severe community-acquired pneumonia (SCAP), this study endeavored to construct 
an innovative nomogram for early identification of individuals at high risk of 
all-cause death within a 30-day period among SCAP patients receiving intensive 
care units (ICU) treatment.
METHODS: In this single-center, retrospective study, 718 SCAP patients were 
screened from the Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care IV (MIMIC-IV) 
database for the development of a predictive model. A total of 97 patients 
eligible for inclusion were included from Chongqing General Hospital, China 
between January 2020 and July 2023 for external validation. Clinical data and 
short-term prognosis were collected. Risk factors were determined using the 
least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) and multiple logistic 
regression analysis. The model's performance was evaluated through area under 
the curve (AUC), calibration curve, and decision curve analysis (DCA).
RESULTS: Eight risk predictors, including age, presence of malignant cancer, 
heart rate, mean arterial pressure, albumin, blood urea nitrogen, prothrombin 
time, and lactate levels were adopted in a nomogram. The nomogram exhibited high 
predictive accuracy, with an AUC of 0.803 (95% CI: 0.756-0.845) in the training 
set, 0.756 (95% CI: 0.693-0.816) in the internal validation set, 0.778 (95% CI: 
0.594-0.893) in the external validation set concerning 30-day mortality. 
Meanwhile, the nomogram demonstrated effective calibration through well-fitted 
calibration curves. DCA confirmed the clinical application value of the 
nomogram.
CONCLUSION: This simple and reliable nomogram can help physicians assess the 
short-term prognosis of patients with SCAP quickly and effectively, and could 
potentially be adopted widely in clinical settings after more external 
validations.

BACKGROUND: Neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio (NLR) has been presented as a 
possible indicator associated with the outcomes of growing patients and an 
available predictor of inflammation. Nevertheless, just a handful of researches 
shed light on the association between NLR and the consequences of critical 
patients with coronary artery disease (CAD). The study aimed to investigate the 
correlation between NLR and all-cause mortality of short-term and long-term in 
patients with CAD.
METHODS: We obtained objective data from the Medical Information Mart for 
Intensive Care (MIMIC)-IV version 2.2, a comprehensive and large-scale 
single-center database. NLR was calculated separately. Patients were categorized 
by quartiles of NLR: Q1 group (NLR < 3.56), Q2 (NLR 3.56-5.54), Q3 group (NLR 
5.54-9.05), Q4 group (NLR > 9.05). Kaplan-Meier survival curves based on NLR 
quartiles were created to compare all-cause mortality rates, and the log-rank 
test evaluated the differences between groups. The hazard ratio (HR) of NLR as a 
risk factor for outcome events was assessed using the Cox proportional risk 
model with the Q1 group serving as the reference group and restricted cubic 
spline (RCS) with the infection points of 5.54.
RESULTS: A total of 3,692 patients were included in this study. The 30-day 
mortality rate among the patients was 8.85%, while the 365-day mortality rate 
was 16.98%. High NLR (NLR > 5.54) was significantly associated with 30-day 
mortality [HR, 3.99,95% confident interval (CI), (3.03-5.24); P < 0.001] and 
365-day mortality [HR, 5.72, 95% CI (3.83-8.54); P < 0.001] in patients with 
critical CAD in the completely adjusted Cox proportional risk model. RCS 
analysis revealed a U-shaped relationship between NLR and outcome events.
CONCLUSION: In patients diagnosed with critical CAD, a significant correlation 
was observed between NLR and all-cause mortality, particularly among individuals 
exhibiting elevated NLR levels. These findings suggest that NLR may serve as a 
valuable prognostic marker for evaluating both short-term and long-term 
mortality risk in this patient population.

OBJECTIVE: As data science and artificial intelligence continue to rapidly gain 
traction, the publication of freely available ICU datasets has become invaluable 
to propel data-driven clinical research. In this guide for clinicians and 
researchers, we aim to: 1) systematically search and identify all publicly 
available adult clinical ICU datasets, 2) compare their characteristics, data 
quality, and richness and critically appraise their strengths and weaknesses, 
and 3) provide researchers with suggestions, which datasets are appropriate for 
answering their clinical question.
DATA SOURCES: A systematic search was performed in Pubmed, ArXiv, MedRxiv, and 
BioRxiv.
STUDY SELECTION: We selected all studies that reported on publicly available 
adult patient-level intensive care datasets.
DATA EXTRACTION: A total of four publicly available, adult, critical care, 
patient-level databases were included (Amsterdam University Medical Center data 
base [AmsterdamUMCdb], eICU Collaborative Research Database eICU CRD], High 
time-resolution intensive care unit dataset [HiRID], and Medical Information 
Mart for Intensive Care-IV). Databases were compared using a priori defined 
categories, including demographics, patient characteristics, and data richness. 
The study protocol and search strategy were prospectively registered.
DATA SYNTHESIS: Four ICU databases fulfilled all criteria for inclusion and were 
queried using SQL (PostgreSQL version 12; PostgreSQL Global Development Group) 
and analyzed using R (R Foundation for Statistical Computing, Vienna, Austria). 
The number of unique patient admissions varied between 23,106 (AmsterdamUMCdb) 
and 200,859 (eICU-CRD). Frequency of laboratory values and vital signs was 
highest in HiRID, for example, 5.2 (±3.4) lactate values per day and 29.7 
(±10.2) systolic blood pressure values per hour. Treatment intensity varied with 
vasopressor and ventilatory support in 69.0% and 83.0% of patients in 
AmsterdamUMCdb versus 12.0% and 21.0% in eICU-CRD, respectively. ICU mortality 
ranged from 5.5% in eICU-CRD to 9.9% in AmsterdamUMCdb.
CONCLUSIONS: We identified four publicly available adult clinical ICU datasets. 
Sample size, severity of illness, treatment intensity, and frequency of reported 
parameters differ markedly between the databases. This should guide clinicians 
and researchers which databases to best answer their clinical questions.

OBJECTIVE: The aims of this study were to investigate the relationship between 
low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) levels and all-cause mortality in 
coronary care unit (CCU) patients, adjusting for a wide range of potential 
confounding factors, to examine the potential of LDL-C in predicting the 
prognostic value of CCU patients.
METHODS: Clinical data were extracted from Medical Information Mart for 
Intensive Care-III database (MIMIC-III database version v.1.4). Baseline data 
were collected within 24 hours after the patient was first admitted to the 
hospital. The primary endpoint of our study is 30-day all-cause mortality. The 
secondary endpoints are 90-day and one-year all-cause mortality and infections. 
Cox proportional hazard regression and propensity score-matched (PSM) analysis 
were used to analyze the association between LDL-C levels and prognostic value 
of CCU patients.
RESULTS: We included a total of 1476 patients with an average age of 66.7 ± 14.1 
years (66% male). For 30-day all-cause mortality, the hazard ratio (95% 
confidence interval) of high LDL-C level group (≥ 55 mg/dl) was 0.42 (0.29, 
0.62), which was compared with low LDL-C level group (< 55 mg/dl) in unadjusted 
model. After adjusting for age, gender and race, the association still existed 
(P < 0.05), and the HR (95% CI) was 0.49 (0.33, 0.72). Further adjustment of 
possible covariates showed similar correlation (P < 0.05), and HR (95% CI) was 
0.65 (0.43, 0.97). Similar correlations were observed for 90-day and one-year 
all-cause mortality. The relationship between all-cause mortality and LDL-C 
levels in CCU patients was further verified by propensity score-matched (PSM) 
analysis. In addition, the higher the LDL-C level, the lower the risk of 
infection, odds ratio (OR) values in the three models were less than 1 (P < 
0.05).
CONCLUSION: Our data suggest that high LDL-C level is associated with a reduced 
risk of 30-day, 90-day, and one-year mortality of patients in the CCU. And this 
result is still stable in the PSM model. The results need to be verified in 
prospective trials.

BACKGROUND: Machine learning has advanced medical event prediction, mostly using 
private data. The public MIMIC-3 (Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care 
III) data set, which contains detailed data on over 40,000 intensive care unit 
patients, stands out as it can help develop better models including structured 
and textual data.
OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to build and test a machine learning model using the 
MIMIC-3 data set to determine the effectiveness of information extracted from 
electronic medical record text using a named entity recognition, specifically 
QuickUMLS, for predicting important medical events. Using the prediction of 
extended-spectrum β-lactamase (ESBL)-producing bacterial infections as an 
example, this study shows how open data sources and simple technology can be 
useful for making clinically meaningful predictions.
METHODS: The MIMIC-3 data set, including demographics, vital signs, laboratory 
results, and textual data, such as discharge summaries, was used. This study 
specifically targeted patients diagnosed with Klebsiella pneumoniae or 
Escherichia coli infection. Predictions were based on ESBL-producing bacterial 
standards and the minimum inhibitory concentration criteria. Both the structured 
data and extracted patient histories were used as predictors. In total, 2 
models, an L1-regularized logistic regression model and a LightGBM model, were 
evaluated using the receiver operating characteristic area under the curve 
(ROC-AUC) and the precision-recall curve area under the curve (PR-AUC).
RESULTS: Of 46,520 MIMIC-3 patients, 4046 were identified with bacterial 
cultures, indicating the presence of K pneumoniae or E coli. After excluding 
patients who lacked discharge summary text, 3614 patients remained. The 
L1-penalized model, with variables from only the structured data, displayed a 
ROC-AUC of 0.646 and a PR-AUC of 0.307. The LightGBM model, combining structured 
and textual data, achieved a ROC-AUC of 0.707 and a PR-AUC of 0.369. Key 
contributors to the LightGBM model included patient age, duration since hospital 
admission, and specific medical history such as diabetes. The structured 
data-based model showed improved performance compared to the reference models. 
Performance was further improved when textual medical history was included. 
Compared to other models predicting drug-resistant bacteria, the results of this 
study ranked in the middle. Some misidentifications, potentially due to the 
limitations of QuickUMLS, may have affected the accuracy of the model.
CONCLUSIONS: This study successfully developed a predictive model for 
ESBL-producing bacterial infections using the MIMIC-3 data set, yielding results 
consistent with existing literature. This model stands out for its transparency 
and reliance on open data and open-named entity recognition technology. The 
performance of the model was enhanced using textual information. With 
advancements in natural language processing tools such as BERT and GPT, the 
extraction of medical data from text holds substantial potential for future 
model optimization.

OBJECTIVE: To investigate the correlation of monocyte/lymphocyte ratio (MLR) 
with the prognosis and adverse event in critically ill patients.
METHODS: Basic information of patients were extracted from Medical Information 
Mart for Intensive Care-III (MIMIC-III), including demographics, blood routine, 
biochemical indexes, systemic inflammatory response syndrome score (SIRS), 
sequential organ failure assessment (SOFA) score, and outcome, etc. MLR on the 
first day of intensive care unit (ICU) admission was calculated. The receiver 
operating characteristic curve (ROC curve) was applied to evaluate the 
prognostic value of MLR on the 30-day mortality and its cut-off value. According 
to the cut-off value, the patients were divided into two groups, and the 
differences between the groups were compared. Logistic regression model was used 
to analyze the relationship of MLR with 30-day mortality, continuous renal 
replacement therapy (CRRT), mechanical ventilation, the length of ICU stay, and 
total hospitalization time.
RESULTS: (1) A total of 43 174 critically ill patients were included. ROC curve 
showed that area under ROC curve (AUC) of MLR in predicting 30-day mortality was 
0.655 [95% confidence interval (95%CI) was 0.632-0.687]. The cut-off value of 
MLR calculated according to the maximum Yoden index was 0.5. There were 16 948 
patients with MLR ≥ 0.5 (high MLR group) and 26 226 patients with MLR < 0.5 (low 
MLR group). (2) Compared with the low MLR group, the high MLR group had higher 
age, proportion of male, body mass index (BMI) [age (years old): 66.0 (51.7, 
78.4) vs. 57.6 (27.1, 74.6), proportion of male: 57.2% vs. 52.5%, BMI (kg/m2): 
26.5 (22.5, 31.1) vs. 24.7 (14.3, 29.7)]. The high MLR group also had higher 
incidence of complications (hypertension: 49.2% vs. 44.6%, chronic heart 
failure: 32.6% vs. 21.7%, diabetes mellitus: 27.0% vs. 23.4%, chronic 
obstructive pulmonary disease: 21.5% vs. 16.1%, renal insufficiency: 19.3% vs. 
13.1%), and higher white blood cell count (WBC), blood glucose, lactate (Lac), 
serum creatinine (SCr), SIRS score and SOFA score [WBC (×109/L): 13.8 (9.6, 
19.2) vs. 11.5 (8.4, 15.6), blood glucose (mmol/L): 8.66 (6.88, 11.49) vs. 8.27 
(6.55, 10.88), Lac (mmol/L): 2.2 (1.5, 3.7) vs. 2.1 (1.4, 3.3), SCr (μmol/L): 
106.1 (70.7, 176.8) vs. 88.4 (70.7, 132.6), SIRS score: 3 (2, 4) vs. 2 (2, 3), 
SOFA score: 4 (2, 7) vs. 3 (1, 5)]. The 30-day mortality, and the proportion of 
patients with length of ICU stay > 5 days, total hospitalization time > 14 days, 
CRRT and mechanical ventilation > 5 days were significantly higher in high MLR 
group (30-day mortality: 20.0% vs. 8.3%, length of ICU stay > 5 days: 33.2% vs. 
20.4%, total hospitalization time > 14 days: 33.7% vs. 16.2%, CRRT: 3.6% vs. 
0.7%, mechanical ventilation > 5 days: 18.4% vs. 5.7%), with statistically 
significant differences (all P < 0.05). (3) After adjusted with the related 
factors, multivariate Logistic regression analysis showed that elevated MLR was 
an independent risk factor for increased 30-day mortality [odd ratio (OR) = 
1.54, 95%CI was 1.37-1.72, P < 0.001]. Moreover, the increased MLR was 
independently associated with the increased risk of usage of CRRT (OR = 2.77, 
95%CI was 2.18-3.51), mechanical ventilation > 5 days (OR = 2.45, 95%CI was 
2.21-2.72), the length of ICU stay > 5 days (OR = 2.29, 95%CI was 2.10-2.49), 
and total hospitalization time > 14 days (OR = 2.28, 95%CI was 2.08-2.49), all P 
< 0.001.
CONCLUSIONS: Retrospective analysis of large sample shows that MLR elevation is 
an independent risk factor for 30-day mortality, usage of CRRT, prolonged 
mechanical ventilation time, prolonged hospitalization, prolonged length of ICU 
stay. MLR can be used for risk stratification of severe patients.

OBJECTIVE: To establish an acute kidney injury (AKI) prediction model in 
patients after cardiac surgery by extreme gradient boosting (XGBoost) machine 
learning model, and to explore the risk and protective factors for AKI in 
patients after cardiac surgery.
METHODS: All patients who underwent cardiac surgery in Medical Information Mart 
for Intensive Care-III (MIMIC-III) database were enrolled, and they were divided 
into AKI group and non-AKI group according to whether AKI developed within 14 
days after cardiac surgery. Their clinical characteristics were compared. Based 
on five-fold cross-validation, XGBoost and Logistic regression were used to 
establish the prediction model of AKI after cardiac surgery. And the area under 
the receiver operator characteristic curve (AUC) of the models was compared. The 
output model of XGBoost was interpreted by Shapley additive explanations (SHAP).
RESULTS: A total of 6 912 patients were included, of which 5 681 (82.2%) 
developed AKI within 14 days after the operation, and 1 231 (17.8%) did not. 
Compared with the non-AKI group, the main characteristics of AKI group included 
older age [years: 68.0 (59.0, 76.0) vs. 62.0 (52.0, 71.0)], higher incidence of 
emergency admission and complicated with obesity and diabetes (52.4% vs. 47.8%, 
9.0% vs. 4.0%, 32.0% vs. 22.2%), lower respiratory rate [RR; bpm: times/min: 
17.0 (14.0, 20.0) vs. 19.0 (15.0, 22.0)], lower heart rate [HR; bpm: 80.0 (67.0, 
89.0) vs. 82.0 (71.5, 93.0)], higher blood pressure [mmHg (1 mmHg ≈ 0.133 kPa): 
80.0 (70.7, 90.0) vs. 78.0 (70.0, 88.0)], higher hemoglobin (Hb), blood glucose, 
blood K+ level and serum creatinine [SCr; Hb (g/L): 122.0 (109.0, 136.0) vs. 
120.0 (106.0, 135.0), blood glucose (mmol/L): 7.3 (6.1, 8.9) vs. 6.8 (5.7, 8.5), 
blood K+ level (mmol/L): 4.2 (3.9, 4.7) vs. 4.2 (3.8, 4.6), SCr (μmol/L): 88.4 
(70.7, 106.1) vs. 79.6 (70.7, 97.2)], lower albumin (ALB) and triacylglycerol 
[TG; ALB (g/L): 38.0 (35.0, 41.0) vs. 39.0 (37.0, 42.0), TG (mmol/L): 1.4 (1.0, 
2.0) vs. 1.5 (1.0, 2.2)] as well as higher incidence of multiple organ 
dysfunction syndrome (MODS) and sepsis (30.6% vs. 16.2%, 3.3% vs. 1.9%), with 
significant differences (all P < 0.05). In the output model of Logistic 
regression, important predictors were lactic acid [Lac; odds ratio (OR) = 1.062, 
95% confidence interval (95%CI) was 1.030-1.100, P = 0.005], obesity (OR = 
2.234, 95%CI was 1.900-2.640, P < 0.001), male (OR = 0.858, 95%CI was 
0.794-0.928, P = 0.049), diabetes (OR = 1.820, 95%CI was 1.680-1.980, P < 0.001) 
and emergency admission (OR = 1.278, 95%CI was 1.190-1.380, P < 0.001). Receiver 
operator characteristic curve (ROC curve) analysis showed that the AUC of the 
Logistic regression model for predicting AKI after cardiac surgery was 0.62 
(95%CI was 0.61-0.67). After optimizing the XGBoost model parameters by grid 
search combined with five-fold cross-validation, the model was trained well with 
no overfitting or overfitting. ROC analysis showed that the AUC of XGBoost model 
for predicting AKI after cardiac surgery was 0.77 (95%CI was 0.75-0.80), which 
was significantly higher than that of Logistic regression model (P < 0.01). 
After SHAP treatment, in the output model of XGBoost, age and ALB were the most 
important predictors of the final outcome, where age was the risk factor 
(average |SHAP value| was 0.434), and ALB was the protective factor (average 
|SHAP value| was 0.221).
CONCLUSIONS: Age is an important risk factor for AKI after cardiac surgery, and 
ALB is a protective factor. The performance of machine learning in predicting 
cardiac and vascular surgery-associated AKI is better than the traditional 
Logistic regression. XGBoost can analyze the more complex relationship between 
variables and outcomes, and can predict the risk of postoperative AKI more 
accurately and individually.
