BACKGROUND: This study aimed to explore the association between the 
triglyceride-glucose (TyG) index and the risk of in-hospital mortality in 
critically ill patients with sepsis.
METHODS: This was a retrospective observational cohort study and data were 
obtained from the Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care-IV (MIMIC IV2.2) 
database. The participants were grouped into three groups according to the TyG 
index tertiles. The primary outcome was in-hospital all-cause mortality. 
Multivariable logistics proportional regression analysis and restricted cubic 
spline regression was used to evaluate the association between the TyG index and 
in-hospital mortality in patients with sepsis. In sensitivity analysis, the 
feature importance of the TyG index was initially determined using machine 
learning algorithms and subgroup analysis based on different subgroups was also 
performed.
RESULTS: 1,257 patients (56.88% men) were included in the study. The 
in-hospital, 28-day and intensive care unit (ICU) mortality were 21.40%, 26.17%, 
and 15.43% respectively. Multivariate logistics regression analysis showed that 
the TyG index was independently associated with an elevated risk of in-hospital 
mortality (OR 1.440 [95% CI 1.106-1.875]; P = 0.00673), 28-day mortality (OR 
1.391; [95% CI 1.52-1.678]; P = 0.01414) and ICU mortality (OR 1.597; [95% CI 
1.188-2.147]; P = 0.00266). The restricted cubic spline regression model 
revealed that the risks of in-hospital, 28-day, and ICU mortality increased 
linearly with increasing TyG index. Sensitivity analysis indicate that the 
effect size and direction in different subgroups are consistent, the results is 
stability. Additionally, the machine learning results suggest that TyG index is 
an important feature for the outcomes of sepsis.
CONCLUSION: Our study indicates that a high TyG index is associated with an 
increased in-hospital mortality in critically ill sepsis patients. Larger 
prospective studies are required to confirm these findings.

BACKGROUND: Acute kidney injury (AKI) is the most common and serious 
complication of sepsis, accompanied by high mortality and disease burden. The 
early prediction of AKI is critical for timely intervention and ultimately 
improves prognosis. This study aims to establish and validate predictive models 
based on novel machine learning (ML) algorithms for AKI in critically ill 
patients with sepsis.
METHODS: Data of patients with sepsis were extracted from the Medical 
Information Mart for Intensive Care III (MIMIC- III) database. Feature selection 
was performed using a Boruta algorithm. ML algorithms such as logistic 
regression (LR), k-nearest neighbors (KNN), support vector machine (SVM), 
decision tree, random forest, Extreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost), and 
artificial neural network (ANN) were applied for model construction by utilizing 
tenfold cross-validation. The performances of these models were assessed in 
terms of discrimination, calibration, and clinical application. Moreover, the 
discrimination of ML-based models was compared with those of Sequential Organ 
Failure Assessment (SOFA) and the customized Simplified Acute Physiology Score 
(SAPS) II model.
RESULTS: A total of 3176 critically ill patients with sepsis were included for 
analysis, of which 2397 cases (75.5%) developed AKI during hospitalization. A 
total of 36 variables were selected for model construction. The models of LR, 
KNN, SVM, decision tree, random forest, ANN, XGBoost, SOFA and SAPS II score 
were established and obtained area under the receiver operating characteristic 
curves of 0.7365, 0.6637, 0.7353, 0.7492, 0.7787, 0.7547, 0.821, 0.6457 and 
0.7015, respectively. The XGBoost model had the best predictive performance in 
terms of discrimination, calibration, and clinical application among all models.
CONCLUSION: The ML models can be reliable tools for predicting AKI in septic 
patients. The XGBoost model has the best predictive performance, which can be 
used to assist clinicians in identifying high-risk patients and implementing 
early interventions to reduce mortality.

Many high quality studies have emerged from public databases, such as 
Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER), National Health and 
Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES), The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA), and 
Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care (MIMIC); however, these data are 
often characterized by a high degree of dimensional heterogeneity, timeliness, 
scarcity, irregularity, and other characteristics, resulting in the value of 
these data not being fully utilized. Data-mining technology has been a frontier 
field in medical research, as it demonstrates excellent performance in 
evaluating patient risks and assisting clinical decision-making in building 
disease-prediction models. Therefore, data mining has unique advantages in 
clinical big-data research, especially in large-scale medical public databases. 
This article introduced the main medical public database and described the 
steps, tasks, and models of data mining in simple language. Additionally, we 
described data-mining methods along with their practical applications. The goal 
of this work was to aid clinical researchers in gaining a clear and intuitive 
understanding of the application of data-mining technology on clinical big-data 
in order to promote the production of research results that are beneficial to 
doctors and patients.

PURPOSE: Compliance to the Surviving Sepsis Campaign (SSC) guidelines is 
limited. This is known to be associated with increased mortality. The aim of 
this retrospective cohort study was to identify among the SCC guidelines the 
optimal bundle of recommendations that minimize 28-day mortality.
METHODS: We used a training cohort to identify, using a least absolute shrinkage 
and selection operator penalized machine learning model, this bundle. Patients 
with sepsis/septic shock admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) were 
extracted from two US databases, the Medical Information Mart for Intensive 
Care-IV (MIMIC-IV) database (training and internal validation cohorts) and the 
eICU Collaborative Research Database (eICU-CRD) (external validation cohort). In 
the validation cohorts, we defined a bundle group that includes patients who 
were treated with at least all the recommendations selected in our bundle and a 
no-bundle group that includes patients in whom at least one recommendation from 
our bundle was omitted.
RESULTS: All-cause 28-day mortality was the primary outcome measure. A total of 
42,735 patients were included. Six recommendations (antimicrobials, balanced 
crystalloid, insulin therapy, corticosteroids, vasopressin, and bicarbonate 
therapy) were identified from the training cohort to be included in our bundle. 
In the propensity score-(PS)-matched internal validation cohort, the bundle 
group was associated with a lower mortality (OR 0.41 [0.33-0.53]; p < 0.001) 
compared to the no-bundle group. This was confirmed in the PS-matched external 
validation cohort (OR 0.75 [0.60-0.94]; p 0.02).
CONCLUSION: Our bundle of six recommendations is associated with a dramatic 
reduction in mortality in sepsis and septic shock. This bundle needs to be 
evaluated prospectively.

BACKGROUND: Acute kidney injury (AKI) is a common complication in critically ill 
patients with sepsis and is often associated with a poor prognosis. We aimed to 
construct and validate an interpretable prognostic prediction model for patients 
with sepsis-associated AKI (S-AKI) using machine learning (ML) methods.
METHODS: Data on the training cohort were collected from the Medical Information 
Mart for Intensive Care IV database version 2.2 to build the model, and data of 
patients were extracted from Hangzhou First People's Hospital Affiliated to 
Zhejiang University School of Medicine for external validation of model. 
Predictors of mortality were identified using Recursive Feature Elimination 
(RFE). Then, random forest, extreme gradient boosting (XGBoost), multilayer 
perceptron classifier, support vector classifier, and logistic regression were 
used to establish a prognosis prediction model for 7, 14, and 28 days after 
intensive care unit (ICU) admission, respectively. Prediction performance was 
assessed using the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve and decision 
curve analysis (DCA). SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) were used to 
interpret the ML models.
RESULTS: In total, 2599 patients with S-AKI were included in the analysis. Forty 
variables were selected for the model development. According to the areas under 
the ROC curve (AUC) and DCA results for the training cohort, XGBoost model 
exhibited excellent performance with F1 Score of 0.847, 0.715, 0.765 and AUC 
(95% CI) of 0.91 (0.90, 0.92), 0.78 (0.76, 0.80), and 0.83 (0.81, 0.85) in 
7 days, 14 days and 28 days group, respectively. It also demonstrated excellent 
discrimination in the external validation cohort. Its AUC (95% CI) was 0.81 
(0.79, 0.83), 0.75 (0.73, 0.77), 0.79 (0.77, 0.81) in 7 days, 14 days and 
28 days group, respectively. SHAP-based summary plot and force plot were used to 
interpret the XGBoost model globally and locally.
CONCLUSIONS: ML is a reliable tool for predicting the prognosis of patients with 
S-AKI. SHAP methods were used to explain intrinsic information of the XGBoost 
model, which may prove clinically useful and help clinicians tailor precise 
management.

BACKGROUND: New-onset atrial fibrillation (NOAF) is the most common arrhythmia 
in critically ill patients admitted to intensive care and is associated with 
poor prognosis and disease burden. Identifying high-risk individuals early is 
crucial. This study aims to create and validate a NOAF prediction model for 
critically ill patients using machine learning (ML).
METHODS: The data came from two non-overlapping datasets from the Medical 
Information Mart for Intensive Care (MIMIC), with MIMIC-IV used for training and 
subset of MIMIC-III used as external validation. LASSO regression was used for 
feature selection. Eight ML algorithms were employed to construct the prediction 
model. Model performance was evaluated based on identification, calibration, and 
clinical application. The SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) method was used 
for visualizing model characteristics and individual case predictions.
RESULTS: Among 16,528 MIMIC-IV patients, 1520 (9.2%) developed AF post-ICU 
admission. A model with 23 variables was built, with XGBoost performing best, 
achieving an AUC of 0.891 (0.873-0.888) in validation and 0.769 (0.756-0.782) in 
external validation. Key predictors included age, mechanical ventilation, urine 
output, sepsis, blood urea nitrogen, percutaneous arterial oxygen saturation, 
continuous renal replacement therapy and weight. A risk probability greater than 
0.6 was defined as high risk. A friendly user interface had been developed for 
clinician use.
CONCLUSION: We developed a ML model to predict the risk of NOAF in critically 
ill patients without cardiac surgery and validated its potential as a clinically 
reliable tool. SHAP improves the interpretability of the model, enables 
clinicians to better understand the causes of NOAF, helps clinicians to prevent 
it in advance and improves patient outcomes.

BACKGROUND: Heart failure (HF) combined with hypertension is an extremely 
important cause of in-hospital mortality, especially for the intensive care unit 
(ICU) patients. However, under intense working pressure, the medical staff are 
easily overwhelmed by the large number of clinical signals generated in the ICU, 
which may lead to treatment delay, sub-optimal care, or even wrong clinical 
decisions. Individual risk stratification is an essential strategy for managing 
ICU patients with HF combined with hypertension. Artificial intelligence, 
especially machine learning (ML), can develop superior models to predict the 
prognosis of these patients. This study aimed to develop a machine learning 
method to predict the 28-day mortality for ICU patients with HF combined with 
hypertension.
METHODS: We enrolled all critically ill patients with HF combined with 
hypertension in the Medical Information Mart for IntensiveCare Database-IV 
(MIMIC-IV, v.1.4) and the eICU Collaborative Research Database (eICU-CRD) from 
2008 to 2019. Subsequently, MIMIC-IV was divided into training cohort and 
testing cohort in an 8:2 ratio, and eICU-CRD was designated as the external 
validation cohort. The least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) 
Cox regression with internal tenfold cross-validation was used for data 
dimension reduction and identifying the most valuable predictive features for 
28-day mortality. Based on its accuracy and area under the curve (AUC), the best 
model in the validation cohort was selected. In addition, we utilized the 
Shapley Additive Explanations (SHAP) method to highlight the importance of model 
features, analyze the impact of individual features on model output, and 
visualize an individual's Shapley values.
RESULTS: A total of 3,458 and 6582 patients with HF combined with hypertension 
in MIMIC-IV and eICU-CRD were included. The patients, including 1,756 males, had 
a median (Q1, Q3) age of 75 (65, 84) years. After selection, 22 out of a total 
of 58 clinical parameters were extracted to develop the machine-learning models. 
Among four constructed models, the Neural Networks (NN) model performed the best 
predictive performance with an AUC of 0.764 and 0.674 in the test cohort and 
external validation cohort, respectively. In addition, a simplified model 
including seven variables was built based on NN, which also had good predictive 
performance (AUC: 0.741). Feature importance analysis showed that age, 
mechanical ventilation (MECHVENT), chloride, bun, anion gap, paraplegia, rdw 
(RDW), hyperlipidemia, peripheral capillary oxygen saturation (SpO2), 
respiratory rate, cerebrovascular disease, heart rate, white blood cell (WBC), 
international normalized ratio (INR), mean corpuscular hemoglobin concentration 
(MCHC), glucose, AIDS, mean corpuscular volume (MCV), N-terminal pro-brain 
natriuretic peptide (Npro. BNP), calcium, renal replacement therapy (RRT), and 
partial thromboplastin time (PTT) were the top 22 features of the NN model with 
the greatest impact. Finally, after hyperparameter optimization, SHAP plots were 
employed to make the NN-based model interpretable with an analytical description 
of how the constructed model visualizes the prediction of death.
CONCLUSION: We developed a predictive model to predict the 28-day mortality for 
ICU patients with HF combined with hypertension, which proved superior to the 
traditional logistic regression analysis. The SHAP method enables machine 
learning models to be more interpretable, thereby helping clinicians to better 
understand the reasoning behind the outcome and assess in-hospital outcomes for 
critically ill patients.

OBJECTIVES: Sepsis is among the leading causes of morbidity, mortality, and cost 
overruns in critically ill patients. Early intervention with antibiotics 
improves survival in septic patients. However, no clinically validated system 
exists for real-time prediction of sepsis onset. We aimed to develop and 
validate an Artificial Intelligence Sepsis Expert algorithm for early prediction 
of sepsis.
DESIGN: Observational cohort study.
SETTING: Academic medical center from January 2013 to December 2015.
PATIENTS: Over 31,000 admissions to the ICUs at two Emory University hospitals 
(development cohort), in addition to over 52,000 ICU patients from the publicly 
available Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care-III ICU database 
(validation cohort). Patients who met the Third International Consensus 
Definitions for Sepsis (Sepsis-3) prior to or within 4 hours of their ICU 
admission were excluded, resulting in roughly 27,000 and 42,000 patients within 
our development and validation cohorts, respectively.
INTERVENTIONS: None.
MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: High-resolution vital signs time series and 
electronic medical record data were extracted. A set of 65 features (variables) 
were calculated on hourly basis and passed to the Artificial Intelligence Sepsis 
Expert algorithm to predict onset of sepsis in the proceeding T hours (where T = 
12, 8, 6, or 4). Artificial Intelligence Sepsis Expert was used to predict onset 
of sepsis in the proceeding T hours and to produce a list of the most 
significant contributing factors. For the 12-, 8-, 6-, and 4-hour ahead 
prediction of sepsis, Artificial Intelligence Sepsis Expert achieved area under 
the receiver operating characteristic in the range of 0.83-0.85. Performance of 
the Artificial Intelligence Sepsis Expert on the development and validation 
cohorts was indistinguishable.
CONCLUSIONS: Using data available in the ICU in real-time, Artificial 
Intelligence Sepsis Expert can accurately predict the onset of sepsis in an ICU 
patient 4-12 hours prior to clinical recognition. A prospective study is 
necessary to determine the clinical utility of the proposed sepsis prediction 
model.

BACKGROUND: This study aimed to construct predictive models for the risk of 
sepsis in patients with Acute pancreatitis (AP) using machine learning methods 
and compared optimal one with the logistic regression (LR) model and scoring 
systems.
METHODS: In this retrospective cohort study, data were collected from the 
Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care III (MIMIC III) database between 
2001 and 2012 and the MIMIC IV database between 2008 and 2019. Patients were 
randomly divided into training and test sets (8:2). The least absolute shrinkage 
and selection operator (LASSO) regression plus 5-fold cross-validation were used 
to screen and confirm the predictive factors. Based on the selected predictive 
factors, 6 machine learning models were constructed, including support vector 
machine (SVM), K-nearest neighbour (KNN), multi-layer perceptron (MLP), LR, 
gradient boosting decision tree (GBDT) and adaptive enhancement algorithm 
(AdaBoost). The models and scoring systems were evaluated and compared using 
sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value (PPV), negative predictive 
value (NPV), accuracy, and the area under the curve (AUC).
RESULTS: A total of 1, 672 patients were eligible for participation. In the 
training set, 261 AP patients (19.51%) were diagnosed with sepsis. The 
predictive factors for the risk of sepsis in AP patients included age, 
insurance, vasopressors, mechanical ventilation, Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS), heart 
rate, respiratory rate, temperature, SpO2, platelet, red blood cell distribution 
width (RDW), International Normalized Ratio (INR), and blood urea nitrogen 
(BUN). The AUC of the GBDT model for sepsis prediction in the AP patients in the 
testing set was 0.985. The GBDT model showed better performance in sepsis 
prediction than the LR, systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS) score, 
bedside index for severity in acute pancreatitis (BISAP) score, sequential organ 
failure assessment (SOFA) score, quick-SOFA (qSOFA), and simplified acute 
physiology score II (SAPS II).
CONCLUSION: The present findings suggest that compared to the classical LR model 
and SOFA, qSOFA, SAPS II, SIRS, and BISAP scores, the machine learning 
model-GBDT model had a better performance in predicting sepsis in the AP 
patients, which is a useful tool for early identification of high-risk patients 
and timely clinical interventions.

BACKGROUND: Cholelithiasis-induced acute cholangitis (CIAC) is an acute 
inflammatory disease with poor prognosis. This study aimed to create 
machine-learning (ML) models to predict the outcomes of patients with CIAC.
METHODS: In this retrospective cohort and ML study, patients who met the both 
diagnosis of 'cholangitis' and 'calculus of gallbladder or bile duct' according 
to the International Classification of Disease (ICD) 9th revision, or met the 
diagnosis of 'calculus of bile duct with acute cholangitis with or without 
obstruction' according to the ICD 10th revision during a single hospitalization 
were included from the Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care database, 
which records patient admissions to Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center, MA, 
USA, spanning June 1, 2001 to November 16, 2022. Patients who were neither 
admitted in an emergency department nor underwent biliary drainage within 24 h 
after admission, had an age of less than 18, or lost over 20% of the information 
were excluded. Nine ML methods, including the Logistic Regression, eXtreme 
Gradient Boosting (XGBoost), Light Gradient Boosting Machine, Adaptive Boosting, 
Decision Tree, Gradient Boosting Decision Tree, Gaussian Naive Bayes, 
Multi-Layer Perceptron, and Support Vector Machine were applied for prediction 
of in-hospital mortality, re-admission within 30 days after discharge, and 
mortality within 180 days after discharge. Patients from Zhongda Hospital 
affiliated to Southeast University in China between January 1, 2019 and July 30, 
2023 were enrolled as an external validation set. The area under the receiver 
operating characteristic curve (AUROC) was the main index for model performance 
assessment.
FINDINGS: A total of 1156 patients were included to construct models. We 
performed stratified analyses on all patients, patients admitted to the 
intensive care unit (ICU) and those who underwent biliary drainage during ICU 
treatment. 13-16 features were selected from 186 variables for model training. 
The XGBoost method demonstrated the most optimal predictive efficacy, as 
evidenced by training set AUROC of 0.996 (95% CI NaN-NaN) for in-hospital 
mortality, 0.886 (0.862-0.910) for re-admission within 30 days after discharge, 
and 0.988 (0.982-0.995) for mortality within 180 days after discharge in all 
patients, 0.998 (NaN-NaN), 0.933 (0.909-0.957), and 0.988 (0.983-0.993) in 
patients admitted to the ICU, 0.987 (0.970-0.999), 0.908 (0.873-0.942), and 
0.982 (0.971-0.993) in patients underwent biliary drainage during ICU treatment, 
respectively. Meanwhile, in the internal validation set, the AUROC reached 0.967 
(0.933-0.998) for in-hospital mortality, 0.589 (0.502-0.677) for re-admission 
within 30 days after discharge, and 0.857 (0.782-0.933) for mortality within 180 
days after discharge in all patients, 0.963 (NaN-NaN), 0.668 (0.486-0.851), and 
0.864 (0.757-0.970) in patients admitted to the ICU, 0.961 (0.922-0.997), 0.669 
(0.540-0.799), and 0.828 (0.730-0.925) in patients underwent biliary drainage 
during ICU treatment, respectively. The AUROC values of external validation set 
consisting of 61 patients were 0.741 (0.725-0.763), 0.812 (0.798-0.824), and 
0.848 (0.841-0.859), respectively.
INTERPRETATION: The XGBoost models could be promising tools to predict outcomes 
in patients with CIAC, and had good clinical applicability. Multi-center 
validation with a larger sample size is warranted.

AIM: To establish a prediction model and assess the risk factors for severe 
diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) in adult patients during the ICU.
INTRODUCTION: With DKA hospitalization rates consistently increasing, 
in-hospital mortality has become a growing concern.
METHODS: DKA patients aged >18 years old in the US-based critical care database 
(Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care (MIMIC-IV)) were considered. 
Independent risk factors for in-hospital mortality were screened using extreme 
gradient boosting (XGBoost) and the Bayesian information criterion (BIC) optimal 
subset regression. One predictive model was developed using machine learning 
extreme gradient boosting (XGBoost), and the other one was a nomogram based on 
logistic regression to estimate risks of in-hospital mortality with severe DKA. 
Established models were assessed by using internal validation and external 
validation. The MIMIC-IV was split into training and testing samples in a 7:3 
ratio. The eICU Collaborative Research Database and admissions data from the 
department of critical care medicine of the first affiliated hospital of Harbin 
medical university were used for independent validation. The discriminatory 
ability of the model was determined by illustrating a receiver operating curve 
(ROC) and calculating the C-index. Meanwhile, the calibration plot and 
Hosmer-Lemeshow goodness-of-fit test (HL test) was conducted to evaluate the 
performance of our new build model. Decision curve analysis (DCA) was performed 
to assess the clinical net benefit. Net Reclassification Improvement (NRI) was 
used to compare the predictive power of the two models.
RESULTS: A multivariable model that included acute physiology score III (APS 
III), the highest levels of blood plasma osmolality (osmolarity_max), minimum 
osmolarity (osmolarity_min)/osmolarity _max, vasopressor, and the highest levels 
of blood lactate was represented as the nomogram. The C- index of the nomogram 
model was 0.915 (95% CI: 0.966-0.864) in the training dataset and 0.971 (95% CI: 
0.992-0.950) in the internal validation. The nomogram's sensitivity was well 
according to all data's HL test (P > 0.05). DCA showed that our model was 
clinically valuable. The XGB (extreme gradient boosting) model achieved an AUC 
(area under the curve) of 0.950 (95% CI, 0.920-0.980); however, the nomogram 
model made was more effective than XGB based on NRI.
CONCLUSION: The predictive XGB and nomogram models for predicting in-hospital 
patient deaths with DKA were effective. The forecast models can help clinical 
physicians promptly identify patients at high risk of DKA, prevent in-hospital 
deaths, and promptly intervene.

Septic patients in the intensive care unit (ICU) often develop sepsis-associated 
delirium (SAD), which is strongly associated with poor prognosis. The aim of 
this study is to develop a machine learning-based model for the early prediction 
of SAD. Patient data were extracted from the Medical Information Mart for 
Intensive Care IV (MIMIC-IV) database and the eICU Collaborative Research 
Database (eICU-CRD). The MIMIC-IV data were divided into a training set and an 
internal validation set, while the eICU-CRD data served as an external 
validation set. Feature variables were selected using least absolute shrinkage 
and selection operator regression, and prediction models were built using 
logistic regression, support vector machines, decision trees, random forests, 
extreme gradient boosting (XGBoost), k-nearest neighbors and naive Bayes 
methods. The performance of the models was evaluated in the validation set. The 
model was also applied to a group of patients who were not assessed or could not 
be assessed for delirium. The MIMIC-IV and eICU-CRD databases included 14,620 
and 1723 patients, respectively, with a median time to diagnosis of SAD of 24 
and 30 h. Compared with Non-SAD patients, SAD patients had higher 28-days ICU 
mortality rates and longer ICU stays. Among the models compared, the XGBoost 
model had the best performance and was selected as the final model (internal 
validation area under the receiver operating characteristic curves 
(AUROC) = 0.793, external validation AUROC = 0.701). The XGBoost model 
outperformed other models in predicting SAD. The establishment of this 
predictive model allows for earlier prediction of SAD compared to traditional 
delirium assessments and is applicable to patients who are difficult to assess 
with traditional methods.

BACKGROUND: Timely diagnosis is crucial for sepsis treatment. Current machine 
learning (ML) models suffer from high complexity and limited applicability. We 
therefore created an ML model using only complete blood count (CBC) diagnostics.
METHODS: We collected non-intensive care unit (non-ICU) data from a German 
tertiary care centre (January 2014 to December 2021). Using patient age, sex, 
and CBC parameters (haemoglobin, platelets, mean corpuscular volume, white and 
red blood cells), we trained a boosted random forest, which predicts sepsis with 
ICU admission. Two external validations were conducted using data from another 
German tertiary care centre and the Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care 
IV database (MIMIC-IV). Using the subset of laboratory orders also including 
procalcitonin (PCT), an analogous model was trained with PCT as an additional 
feature.
RESULTS: After exclusion, 1 381 358 laboratory requests (2016 from sepsis cases) 
were available. The CBC model shows an area under the receiver operating 
characteristic (AUROC) of 0.872 (95% CI, 0.857-0.887). External validations show 
AUROCs of 0.805 (95% CI, 0.787-0.824) for University Medicine Greifswald and 
0.845 (95% CI, 0.837-0.852) for MIMIC-IV. The model including PCT revealed a 
significantly higher AUROC (0.857; 95% CI, 0.836-0.877) than PCT alone (0.790; 
95% CI, 0.759-0.821; P < 0.001).
CONCLUSIONS: Our results demonstrate that routine CBC results could 
significantly improve diagnosis of sepsis when combined with ML. The CBC model 
can facilitate early sepsis prediction in non-ICU patients with high robustness 
in external validations. Its implementation in clinical decision support systems 
has strong potential to provide an essential time advantage and increase patient 
safety.

BACKGROUND: Sepsis is a life-threatening syndrome eliciting highly heterogeneous 
host responses. Current prognostic evaluation methods used in clinical practice 
are characterized by an inadequate effectiveness in predicting sepsis mortality. 
Rapid identification of patients with high mortality risk is urgently needed. 
The phenotyping of patients will assistant invaluably in tailoring treatments.
METHODS: Machine learning and deep learning technology are used to characterize 
the patients' phenotype and determine the sepsis severity. The database used in 
this study is MIMIC-III and MIMIC-IV ('Medical information Mart for intensive 
care') which is a large, public, and freely available database. The K-means 
clustering is used to classify the sepsis phenotype. Convolutional neural 
network (CNN) was used to predict the 28-day survival rate based on 35 blood 
test variables of the sepsis patients, whereas a double coefficient quadratic 
multivariate fitting function (DCQMFF) is utilized to predict the 28-day 
survival rate with only 11 features of sepsis patients.
RESULTS: The patients were grouped into four clusters with a clear survival 
nomogram. The first cluster (C_1) was characterized by low white blood cell 
count, low neutrophil, and the highest lymphocyte proportion. C_2 obtained the 
lowest Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (SOFA) score and the highest survival 
rate. C_3 was characterized by significantly prolonged PTT, high SIC, and a 
higher proportion of patients using heparin than the patients in other clusters. 
The early mortality rate of patients in C_3 was high but with a better long-term 
survival rate than that in C_4. C_4 contained septic coagulation patients with 
the worst prognosis, characterized by slightly prolonged partial thromboplastin 
time (PTT), significantly prolonged prothrombin time (PT), and high septic 
coagulation disease score (SIC). The survival rate prediction accuracy of CNN 
and DCQMFF models reached 92% and 82%, respectively. The models were tested on 
an external dataset (MIMIC-IV) and achieved good performance. A DCQMFF-based 
application platform was established for fast prediction of the 28-day survival 
rate.
CONCLUSION: CNN and DCQMFF accurately predicted the sepsis patients' survival, 
while K-means successfully identified the phenotype groups. The distinct 
phenotypes associated with survival, and significant features correlated with 
mortality were identified. The findings suggest that sepsis patients with 
abnormal coagulation had poor outcomes, abnormal coagulation increase mortality 
during sepsis. The anticoagulation effects of appropriate heparin sodium 
treatment may improve extensive micro thrombosis-caused organ failure.

BACKGROUND: Current classification for acute kidney injury (AKI) in critically 
ill patients with sepsis relies only on its severity-measured by maximum 
creatinine which overlooks inherent complexities and longitudinal evaluation of 
this heterogenous syndrome. The role of classification of AKI based on early 
creatinine trajectories is unclear.
METHODS: This retrospective study identified patients with Sepsis-3 who 
developed AKI within 48-h of intensive care unit admission using Medical 
Information Mart for Intensive Care-IV database. We used latent class mixed 
modelling to identify early creatinine trajectory-based classes of AKI in 
critically ill patients with sepsis. Our primary outcome was development of 
acute kidney disease (AKD). Secondary outcomes were composite of AKD or 
all-cause in-hospital mortality by day 7, and AKD or all-cause in-hospital 
mortality by hospital discharge. We used multivariable regression to assess 
impact of creatinine trajectory-based classification on outcomes, and eICU 
database for external validation.
RESULTS: Among 4197 patients with AKI in critically ill patients with sepsis, we 
identified eight creatinine trajectory-based classes with distinct 
characteristics. Compared to the class with transient AKI, the class that showed 
severe AKI with mild improvement but persistence had highest adjusted risks for 
developing AKD (OR 5.16; 95% CI 2.87-9.24) and composite 7-day outcome (HR 4.51; 
95% CI 2.69-7.56). The class that demonstrated late mild AKI with persistence 
and worsening had highest risks for developing composite hospital discharge 
outcome (HR 2.04; 95% CI 1.41-2.94). These associations were similar on external 
validation.
CONCLUSIONS: These 8 classes of AKI in critically ill patients with sepsis, 
stratified by early creatinine trajectories, were good predictors for key 
outcomes in patients with AKI in critically ill patients with sepsis independent 
of their AKI staging.

BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Deep learning applied to electrocardiograms (ECG-AI) is an 
emerging approach for predicting atrial fibrillation or flutter (AF). This study 
introduces an ECG-AI model developed and tested at a tertiary cardiac centre, 
comparing its performance with clinical models and AF polygenic score (PGS).
METHODS: Electrocardiograms in sinus rhythm from the Montreal Heart Institute 
were analysed, excluding those from patients with pre-existing AF. The primary 
outcome was incident AF at 5 years. An ECG-AI model was developed by splitting 
patients into non-overlapping data sets: 70% for training, 10% for validation, 
and 20% for testing. The performance of ECG-AI, clinical models, and PGS was 
assessed in the test data set. The ECG-AI model was externally validated in the 
Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care-IV (MIMIC-IV) hospital data set.
RESULTS: A total of 669 782 ECGs from 145 323 patients were included. Mean age 
was 61 ± 15 years, and 58% were male. The primary outcome was observed in 15% of 
patients, and the ECG-AI model showed an area under the receiver operating 
characteristic (AUC-ROC) curve of .78. In time-to-event analysis including the 
first ECG, ECG-AI inference of high risk identified 26% of the population with a 
4.3-fold increased risk of incident AF (95% confidence interval: 4.02-4.57). In 
a subgroup analysis of 2301 patients, ECG-AI outperformed CHARGE-AF (AUC-ROC = 
.62) and PGS (AUC-ROC = .59). Adding PGS and CHARGE-AF to ECG-AI improved 
goodness of fit (likelihood ratio test P < .001), with minimal changes to the 
AUC-ROC (.76-.77). In the external validation cohort (mean age 59 ± 18 years, 
47% male, median follow-up 1.1 year), ECG-AI model performance remained 
consistent (AUC-ROC = .77).
CONCLUSIONS: ECG-AI provides an accurate tool to predict new-onset AF in a 
tertiary cardiac centre, surpassing clinical and PGS.

OBJECTIVES: This study aims to develop and validate a prediction model 
in-hospital mortality in critically ill patients with sepsis-associated acute 
kidney injury (SA-AKI) based on machine learning algorithms.
METHODS: Patients who met the criteria for inclusion were identified in the 
Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care-IV (MIMIC-IV) database and divided 
according to the validation (n = 2440) and development (n = 9756, 80%) queues. 
Ensemble stepwise feature selection method was used to screen for effective 
features. The prediction models of short-term mortality were developed by seven 
machine learning algorithms. Ten-fold cross-validation was used to verify the 
performance of the algorithm in the development queue. The area under the 
receiver operating characteristic curve (ROC-AUC) was used to evaluate the 
differentiation accuracy and performance of the prediction model in the 
validation queue. The best-performing model was interpreted by Shapley additive 
explanations (SHAP).
RESULTS: A total of 12,196 patients were enrolled in this study. Eleven 
variables were finally chosen to develop the prediction model. The AUC of the 
random forest (RF) model was the highest value both in the Ten-fold 
cross-validation and evaluation (AUC: 0.798, 95% CI: 0.774-0.821). According to 
the SHAP plots, old age, low Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) score, high AKI stage, 
reduced urine output, high Simplified Acute Physiology Score (SAPS II), high 
respiratory rate, low temperature, low absolute lymphocyte count, high 
creatinine level, dysnatremia, and low body mass index (BMI) increased the risk 
of poor prognosis.
CONCLUSIONS: The RF model developed in this study is a good predictor of 
in-hospital mortality for patients with SA-AKI in the intensive care unit (ICU), 
which may have potential applications in mortality prediction.

BACKGROUND: A real-time model for predicting short-term mortality in critically 
ill patients is needed to identify patients at imminent risk. However, the 
performance of the model needs to be validated in various clinical settings and 
ethnicities before its clinical application. In this study, we aim to develop an 
ensemble machine learning model using routinely measured clinical variables at a 
single academic institution in South Korea.
METHODS: We developed an ensemble model using deep learning and light gradient 
boosting machine models. Internal validation was performed using the last two 
years of the internal cohort dataset, collected from a single academic hospital 
in South Korea between 2007 and 2021. External validation was performed using 
the full Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care (MIMIC), eICU-Collaborative 
Research Database (eICU-CRD), and Amsterdam University Medical Center database 
(AmsterdamUMCdb) data. The area under the receiver operating characteristic 
curve (AUROC) was calculated and compared to that for the National Early Warning 
Score (NEWS).
RESULTS: The developed model (iMORS) demonstrated high predictive performance 
with an internal AUROC of 0.964 (95% confidence interval [CI] 0.963-0.965) and 
external AUROCs of 0.890 (95% CI 0.889-0.891) for MIMIC, 0.886 (95% CI 
0.885-0.887) for eICU-CRD, and 0.870 (95% CI 0.868-0.873) for AmsterdamUMCdb. 
The model outperformed the NEWS with higher AUROCs in the internal and external 
validation (0.866 for the internal, 0.746 for MIMIC, 0.798 for eICU-CRD, and 
0.819 for AmsterdamUMCdb; p < 0.001).
CONCLUSIONS: Our real-time machine learning model to predict short-term 
mortality in critically ill patients showed excellent performance in both 
internal and external validations. This model could be a useful decision-support 
tool in the intensive care units to assist clinicians.

Clinical decision-making is one of the most impactful parts of a physician's 
responsibilities and stands to benefit greatly from artificial intelligence 
solutions and large language models (LLMs) in particular. However, while LLMs 
have achieved excellent performance on medical licensing exams, these tests fail 
to assess many skills necessary for deployment in a realistic clinical 
decision-making environment, including gathering information, adhering to 
guidelines, and integrating into clinical workflows. Here we have created a 
curated dataset based on the Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care 
database spanning 2,400 real patient cases and four common abdominal pathologies 
as well as a framework to simulate a realistic clinical setting. We show that 
current state-of-the-art LLMs do not accurately diagnose patients across all 
pathologies (performing significantly worse than physicians), follow neither 
diagnostic nor treatment guidelines, and cannot interpret laboratory results, 
thus posing a serious risk to the health of patients. Furthermore, we move 
beyond diagnostic accuracy and demonstrate that they cannot be easily integrated 
into existing workflows because they often fail to follow instructions and are 
sensitive to both the quantity and order of information. Overall, our analysis 
reveals that LLMs are currently not ready for autonomous clinical 
decision-making while providing a dataset and framework to guide future studies.

BACKGROUND: Elderly patients with sepsis have many comorbidities, and the 
clinical reaction is not obvious. Thus, clinical treatment is difficult. We 
planned to use the laboratory test results and comorbidities of elderly patients 
with sepsis from a large-scale public database Medical Information Mart for 
Intensive Care (MIMIC) IV to build a random survival forest (RSF) model and to 
evaluate the model's predictive value for these patients.
METHODS: Clinical information of elderly patients with sepsis in MIMIC IV 
database was collected retrospectively. Machine learning (RSF) was used to 
select the top 30 variables in the training cohort to build the final RSF model. 
The model was compared with the traditional scoring systems SOFA, SAPSII, and 
APSIII. The performance of the model was evaluated by C index and calibration 
curve.
RESULTS: A total of 6,503 patients were enrolled in the study. The top 30 
important variables screened by RSF were used to construct the final RSF model. 
The new model provided a better C-index (0.731 in the validation cohort). The 
calibration curve described the agreement between the predicted probability of 
RSF model and the observed 30-day survival.
CONCLUSIONS: We constructed a prognostic model to predict a 30-day mortality 
risk in elderly patients with sepsis based on machine learning (RSF algorithm), 
and it proved superior to the traditional scoring systems. The risk factors 
affecting the patients were also ranked. In addition to the common risk factors 
of vasopressors, ventilator use, and urine output. Newly added factors such as 
RDW, type of ICU unit, malignant cancer, and metastatic solid tumor also 
significantly influence prognosis.

OBJECTIVE: Sepsis-induced coagulopathy (SIC) is extremely common in individuals 
with sepsis, significantly associated with poor outcomes. This study attempted 
to develop an interpretable and generalizable machine learning (ML) model for 
early predicting the risk of 28-day death in patients with SIC.
METHODS: In this retrospective cohort study, we extracted SIC patients from the 
Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care III (MIMIC-III), MIMIC-IV, and 
eICU-CRD database according to Toshiaki Iba's scale. And the overlapping in the 
MIMIC-IV was excluded for this study. Afterward, only the MIMIC-III cohort was 
randomly divided into the training set, and the internal validation set 
according to the ratio of 7:3, while the MIMIC-IV and eICU-CRD databases were 
considered the external validation sets. The predictive factors for 28-day 
mortality of SIC patients were determined using recursive feature elimination 
combined with tenfold cross-validation (RFECV). Then, we constructed models 
using ML algorithms. Multiple metrics were used for evaluation of performance of 
the models, including the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve 
(AUROC), area under the precision recall curve (AUPRC), accuracy, sensitivity, 
specificity, negative predictive value, positive predictive value, recall, and 
F1 score. Finally, Shapley Additive Explanations (SHAP), Local Interpretable 
Model-Agnostic Explanations (LIME) were employed to provide a reasonable 
interpretation for the prediction results.
RESULTS: A total of 3280, 2798, and 1668 SIC patients were screened from 
MIMIC-III, MIMIC-IV, and eICU-CRD databases, respectively. Seventeen features 
were selected to construct ML prediction models. XGBoost had the best 
performance in predicting the 28-day mortality of SIC patients, with AUC of 
0.828, 0.913 and 0.923, the AUPRC of 0.807, 0.796 and 0.921, the accuracy of 
0.785, 0.885 and 0.891, the F1 scores were 0.63, 0.69 and 0.70 in MIMIC-III 
(internal validation set), MIMIC-IV, and eICU-CRD databases. The importance 
ranking and SHAP analyses showed that initial SOFA score, red blood cell 
distribution width (RDW), and age were the top three critical features in the 
XGBoost model.
CONCLUSIONS: We developed an optimal and explainable ML model to predict the 
risk of 28-day death of SIC patients 28-day death risk. Compared with 
conventional scoring systems, the XGBoost model performed better. The model 
established will have the potential to improve the level of clinical practice 
for SIC patients.

OBJECTIVE: The predictors of in-hospital mortality for intensive care units 
(ICUs)-admitted heart failure (HF) patients remain poorly characterised. We 
aimed to develop and validate a prediction model for all-cause in-hospital 
mortality among ICU-admitted HF patients.
DESIGN: A retrospective cohort study.
SETTING AND PARTICIPANTS: Data were extracted from the Medical Information Mart 
for Intensive Care (MIMIC-III) database. Data on 1177 heart failure patients 
were analysed.
METHODS: Patients meeting the inclusion criteria were identified from the 
MIMIC-III database and randomly divided into derivation (n=825, 70%) and a 
validation (n=352, 30%) group. Independent risk factors for in-hospital 
mortality were screened using the extreme gradient boosting (XGBoost) and the 
least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) regression models in the 
derivation sample. Multivariate logistic regression analysis was used to build 
prediction models in derivation group, and then validated in validation cohort. 
Discrimination, calibration and clinical usefulness of the predicting model were 
assessed using the C-index, calibration plot and decision curve analysis. After 
pairwise comparison, the best performing model was chosen to build a nomogram 
according to the regression coefficients.
RESULTS: Among the 1177 admissions, in-hospital mortality was 13.52%. In both 
groups, the XGBoost, LASSO regression and Get With the Guidelines-Heart Failure 
(GWTG-HF) risk score models showed acceptable discrimination. The XGBoost and 
LASSO regression models also showed good calibration. In pairwise comparison, 
the prediction effectiveness was higher with the XGBoost and LASSO regression 
models than with the GWTG-HF risk score model (p<0.05). The XGBoost model was 
chosen as our final model for its more concise and wider net beneﬁt threshold 
probability range and was presented as the nomogram.
CONCLUSIONS: Our nomogram enabled good prediction of in-hospital mortality in 
ICU-admitted HF patients, which may help clinical decision-making for such 
patients.

BACKGROUND: Acute kidney disease (AKD) affects more than half of critically ill 
elderly patients with acute kidney injury (AKI), which leads to worse short-term 
outcomes.
OBJECTIVE: We aimed to establish 2 machine learning models to predict the risk 
and prognosis of AKD in the elderly and to deploy the models as online apps.
METHODS: Data on elderly patients with AKI (n=3542) and AKD (n=2661) from the 
Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care IV (MIMIC-IV) database were used to 
develop 2 models for predicting the AKD risk and in-hospital mortality, 
respectively. Data collected from Xiangya Hospital of Central South University 
were for external validation. A bootstrap method was used for internal 
validation to obtain relatively stable results. We extracted the indicators 
within 24 hours of the first diagnosis of AKI and the fluctuation range of some 
indicators, namely delta (day 3 after AKI minus day 1), as features. Six machine 
learning algorithms were used for modeling; the area under the receiver 
operating characteristic curve (AUROC), decision curve analysis, and calibration 
curve for evaluating; Shapley additive explanation (SHAP) analysis for visually 
interpreting; and the Heroku platform for deploying the best-performing models 
as web-based apps.
RESULTS: For the model of predicting the risk of AKD in elderly patients with 
AKI during hospitalization, the Light Gradient Boosting Machine (LightGBM) 
showed the best overall performance in the training (AUROC=0.844, 95% CI 
0.831-0.857), internal validation (AUROC=0.853, 95% CI 0.841-0.865), and 
external (AUROC=0.755, 95% CI 0.699-0.811) cohorts. In addition, LightGBM 
performed well for the AKD prognostic prediction in the training (AUROC=0.861, 
95% CI 0.843-0.878), internal validation (AUROC=0.868, 95% CI 0.851-0.885), and 
external (AUROC=0.746, 95% CI 0.673-0.820) cohorts. The models deployed as 
online prediction apps allowed users to predict and provide feedback to submit 
new data for model iteration. In the importance ranking and correlation 
visualization of the model's top 10 influencing factors conducted based on the 
SHAP value, partial dependence plots revealed the optimal cutoff of some 
interventionable indicators. The top 5 factors predicting the risk of AKD were 
creatinine on day 3, sepsis, delta blood urea nitrogen (BUN), diastolic blood 
pressure (DBP), and heart rate, while the top 5 factors determining in-hospital 
mortality were age, BUN on day 1, vasopressor use, BUN on day 3, and partial 
pressure of carbon dioxide (PaCO2).
CONCLUSIONS: We developed and validated 2 online apps for predicting the risk of 
AKD and its prognostic mortality in elderly patients, respectively. The top 10 
factors that influenced the AKD risk and mortality during hospitalization were 
identified and explained visually, which might provide useful applications for 
intelligent management and suggestions for future prospective research.

BACKGROUND: To construct and evaluate a predictive model for in-hospital 
mortality among critically ill patients with acute kidney injury (AKI) 
undergoing continuous renal replacement therapy (CRRT), based on nine machine 
learning (ML) algorithm.
METHODS: The study retrospectively included patients with AKI who underwent CRRT 
during their initial hospitalization in the United States using the medical 
information mart for intensive care (MIMIC) database IV (version 2.0), as well 
as in the intensive care unit (ICU) of Huzhou Central Hospital. Patients from 
the MIMIC database were used as the training cohort to construct the models 
(from 2008 to 2019, n = 1068). Patients from Huzhou Central Hospital were 
utilized as the external validation cohort to evaluate the models (from June 
2019 to December 2022, n = 327). In the training cohort, least absolute 
shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) regression with cross-validation was 
employed to select features for constructing the model and subsequently 
established nine ML predictive models. The performance of these nine models on 
the external validation cohort dataset was comprehensively evaluated based on 
the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUROC) and the 
optimal model was selected. A static nomogram and a web-based dynamic nomogram 
were presented, with a comprehensive evaluation from the perspectives of 
discrimination (AUROC), calibration (calibration curve) and clinical 
practicability (DCA curves).
RESULTS: Finally, 1395 eligible patients were enrolled, including 1068 patients 
in the training cohort and 327 patients in the external validation cohort. In 
the training cohort, LASSO regression with cross-validation was employed to 
select features and nine models were individually constructed. Compared to the 
other eight models, the Lasso regularized logistic regression (Lasso-LR) model 
exhibited the highest AUROC (0.756) and the optimal calibration curve. The DCA 
curve suggested a certain clinical utility in predicting in-hospital mortality 
among critically ill patients with AKI undergoing CRRT. Consequently, the 
Lasso-LR model was the optimal model and it was visualized as a common nomogram 
(static nomogram) and a web-based dynamic nomogram 
(https://chsyh2006.shinyapps.io/dynnomapp/). Discrimination, calibration and DCA 
curves were employed to assess the performance of the nomogram. The AUROC for 
the training and external validation cohorts in the nomogram model was 0.771 
(95%CI: 0.743, 0.799) and 0.756 (95%CI: 0.702, 0.809), respectively. The 
calibration slope and Brier score for the training cohort were 1.000 and 0.195, 
while for the external validation cohort, they were 0.849 and 0.197, 
respectively. The DCA indicated that the model had a certain clinical 
application value.
CONCLUSIONS: Our study selected the optimal model and visualized it as a static 
and dynamic nomogram integrating clinical predictors, so that clinicians can 
personalized predict the in-hospital outcome of critically ill patients with AKI 
undergoing CRRT upon ICU admission.

BACKGROUND: The atherogenic index of plasma (AIP) is considered an important 
marker of atherosclerosis and cardiovascular risk. However, its potential role 
in predicting length of stay (LOS), especially in patients with atherosclerotic 
cardiovascular disease (ASCVD), remains to be explored. We investigated the 
effect of AIP on hospital LOS in critically ill ASCVD patients and explored the 
risk factors affecting LOS in conjunction with machine learning.
METHODS: Using data from the Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care 
(MIMIC)-IV. AIP was calculated as the logarithmic ratio of TG to HDL-C, and 
patients were stratified into four groups based on AIP values. We investigated 
the association between AIP and two key clinical outcomes: ICU LOS and total 
hospital LOS. Multivariate logistic regression models were used to evaluate 
these associations, while restricted cubic spline (RCS) regressions assessed 
potential nonlinear relationships. Additionally, machine learning (ML) 
techniques, including logistic regression (LR), decision tree (DT), random 
forest (RF), extreme gradient boosting (XGB), and light gradient boosting 
machine (LGB), were applied, with the Shapley additive explanation (SHAP) method 
used to determine feature importance.
RESULTS: The study enrolled a total of 2423 patients with critically ill ASCVD, 
predominantly male (54.91%), and revealed that higher AIP values were 
independently associated with longer ICU and hospital stays. Specifically, for 
each unit increase in AIP, the odds of prolonged ICU and hospital stays were 
significantly higher, with adjusted odds ratios (OR) of 1.42 (95% CI, 1.11-1.81; 
P = 0.006) and 1.73 (95% CI, 1.34-2.24; P < 0.001), respectively. The RCS 
regression demonstrated a linear relationship between increasing AIP and both 
ICU LOS and hospital LOS. ML models, specifically LGB (ROC:0.740) and LR 
(ROC:0.832) demonstrated superior predictive accuracy for these endpoints, 
identifying AIP as a vital component of hospitalization duration.
CONCLUSION: AIP is a significant predictor of ICU and hospital LOS in patients 
with critically ill ASCVD. AIP could serve as an early prognostic tool for 
guiding clinical decision-making and managing patient outcomes.

BACKGROUND: Comorbidity, frailty, and decreased cognitive function lead to a 
higher risk of death in elderly patients (more than 65 years of age) during 
acute medical events. Early and accurate illness severity assessment can support 
appropriate decision making for clinicians caring for these patients. We aimed 
to develop ELDER-ICU, a machine learning model to assess the illness severity of 
older adults admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) with cohort-specific 
calibration and evaluation for potential model bias.
METHODS: In this retrospective, international multicentre study, the ELDER-ICU 
model was developed using data from 14 US hospitals, and validated in 171 
hospitals from the USA and Netherlands. Data were extracted from the Medical 
Information Mart for Intensive Care database, electronic ICU Collaborative 
Research Database, and Amsterdam University Medical Centers Database. We used 
six categories of data as predictors, including demographics and comorbidities, 
physical frailty, laboratory tests, vital signs, treatments, and urine output. 
Patient data from the first day of ICU stay were used to predict in-hospital 
mortality. We used the eXtreme Gradient Boosting algorithm (XGBoost) to develop 
models and the SHapley Additive exPlanations method to explain model prediction. 
The trained model was calibrated before internal, external, and temporal 
validation. The final XGBoost model was compared against three other machine 
learning algorithms and five clinical scores. We performed subgroup analysis 
based on age, sex, and race. We assessed the discrimination and calibration of 
models using the area under receiver operating characteristic (AUROC) and 
standardised mortality ratio (SMR) with 95% CIs.
FINDINGS: Using the development dataset (n=50 366) and predictive model building 
process, the XGBoost algorithm performed the best in all types of validations 
compared with other machine learning algorithms and clinical scores (internal 
validation with 5037 patients from 14 US hospitals, AUROC=0·866 [95% CI 
0·851-0·880]; external validation in the US population with 20 541 patients from 
169 hospitals, AUROC=0·838 [0·829-0·847]; external validation in European 
population with 2411 patients from one hospital, AUROC=0·833 [0·812-0·853]; 
temporal validation with 4311 patients from one hospital, AUROC=0·884 
[0·869-0·897]). In the external validation set (US population), the median 
AUROCs of bias evaluations covering eight subgroups were above 0·81, and the 
overall SMR was 0·99 (0·96-1·03). The top ten risk predictors were the minimum 
Glasgow Coma Scale score, total urine output, average respiratory rate, 
mechanical ventilation use, best state of activity, Charlson Comorbidity Index 
score, geriatric nutritional risk index, code status, age, and maximum blood 
urea nitrogen. A simplified model containing only the top 20 features 
(ELDER-ICU-20) had similar predictive performance to the full model.
INTERPRETATION: The ELDER-ICU model reliably predicts the risk of in-hospital 
mortality using routinely collected clinical features. The predictions could 
inform clinicians about patients who are at elevated risk of deterioration. 
Prospective validation of this model in clinical practice and a process for 
continuous performance monitoring and model recalibration are needed.

PURPOSE: This study aims to develop and validate a prediction model for delirium 
in elderly ICU patients and help clinicians identify high-risk patients at the 
early stage.
METHODS: Patients admitted to ICU for at least 24 h and using the Confusion 
Assessment Method for the Intensive Care Unit (CAM-ICU) in the Medical 
Information Mart for Intensive Care-IV (MIMIC-IV) database (76,943 ICU stays 
from 2008 to 2019) were considered. Patients with a positive delirium test in 
the first 24 h and under 65 years of age were excluded. Two prediction models, 
machine learning extreme gradient boosting (XGBoost) and logistic regression 
(LR) model, were developed and validated to predict the onset of delirium.
RESULTS: Of the 18,760 patients included in the analysis, 3463(18.5%) were 
delirium positive. A total of 22 significant predictors were selected by LASSO 
regression. The XGBoost model demonstrated superior performance over the LR 
model, with the Area Under the Receiver Operating Characteristic (AUC) values of 
0.853 (95% confidence interval [CI] 0.846-0.861) and 0.831 (95% CI 0.815-0.847) 
in the training and testing datasets, respectively. Moreover, the XGBoost model 
outperformed the LR model in both calibration and clinical utility. The top five 
predictors associated with the onset of delirium were sequential organ failure 
assessment (SOFA), infection, minimum platelets, maximum systolic blood pressure 
(SBP), and maximum temperature.
CONCLUSION: The XGBoost model demonstrated good predictive performance for 
delirium among elderly ICU patients, thus assisting clinicians in identifying 
high-risk patients at the early stage and implementing targeted interventions to 
improve outcome.

BACKGROUND: Intensive care research has predominantly relied on conventional 
methods like randomized controlled trials. However, the increasing popularity of 
open-access, free databases in the past decade has opened new avenues for 
research, offering fresh insights. Leveraging machine learning (ML) techniques 
enables the analysis of trends in a vast number of studies.
OBJECTIVE: This study aims to conduct a comprehensive bibliometric analysis 
using ML to compare trends and research topics in traditional intensive care 
unit (ICU) studies and those done with open-access databases (OADs).
METHODS: We used ML for the analysis of publications in the Web of Science 
database in this study. Articles were categorized into "OAD" and "traditional 
intensive care" (TIC) studies. OAD studies were included in the Medical 
Information Mart for Intensive Care (MIMIC), eICU Collaborative Research 
Database (eICU-CRD), Amsterdam University Medical Centers Database 
(AmsterdamUMCdb), High Time Resolution ICU Dataset (HiRID), and Pediatric 
Intensive Care database. TIC studies included all other intensive care studies. 
Uniform manifold approximation and projection was used to visualize the corpus 
distribution. The BERTopic technique was used to generate 30 topic-unique 
identification numbers and to categorize topics into 22 topic families.
RESULTS: A total of 227,893 records were extracted. After exclusions, 145,426 
articles were identified as TIC and 1301 articles as OAD studies. TIC studies 
experienced exponential growth over the last 2 decades, culminating in a peak of 
16,378 articles in 2021, while OAD studies demonstrated a consistent upsurge 
since 2018. Sepsis, ventilation-related research, and pediatric intensive care 
were the most frequently discussed topics. TIC studies exhibited broader 
coverage than OAD studies, suggesting a more extensive research scope.
CONCLUSIONS: This study analyzed ICU research, providing valuable insights from 
a large number of publications. OAD studies complement TIC studies, focusing on 
predictive modeling, while TIC studies capture essential qualitative 
information. Integrating both approaches in a complementary manner is the future 
direction for ICU research. Additionally, natural language processing techniques 
offer a transformative alternative for literature review and bibliometric 
analysis.

Sepsis-Associated Liver Injury (SALI) is an independent risk factor for death 
from sepsis. The aim of this study was to develop an interpretable machine 
learning model for early prediction of 28-day mortality in patients with SALI. 
Data from the Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care (MIMIC-IV, v2.2, 
MIMIC-III, v1.4) were used in this study. The study cohort from MIMIC-IV was 
randomized to the training set (0.7) and the internal validation set (0.3), with 
MIMIC-III (2001 to 2008) as external validation. The features with more than 20% 
missing values were deleted and the remaining features were multiple 
interpolated. Lasso-CV that lasso linear model with iterative fitting along a 
regularization path in which the best model is selected by cross-validation was 
used to select important features for model development. Eight machine learning 
models including Random Forest (RF), Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, Extreme 
Gradient Boost (XGBoost), K Nearest Neighbor, Support Vector Machine, 
Generalized Linear Models in which the best model is selected by 
cross-validation (CV_glmnet), and Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA) were 
developed. Shapley additive interpretation (SHAP) was used to improve the 
interpretability of the optimal model. At last, a total of 1043 patients were 
included, of whom 710 were from MIMIC-IV and 333 from MIMIC-III. Twenty-four 
clinically relevant parameters were selected for model construction. For the 
prediction of 28-day mortality of SALI in the internal validation set, the area 
under the curve (AUC (95% CI)) of RF was 0.79 (95% CI: 0.73-0.86), and which 
performed the best. Compared with the traditional disease severity scores 
including Oxford Acute Severity of Illness Score (OASIS), Sequential Organ 
Failure Assessment (SOFA), Simplified Acute Physiology Score II (SAPS II), 
Logistic Organ Dysfunction Score (LODS), Systemic Inflammatory Response Syndrome 
(SIRS), and Acute Physiology Score III (APS III), RF also had the best 
performance. SHAP analysis found that Urine output, Charlson Comorbidity Index 
(CCI), minimal Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS_min), blood urea nitrogen (BUN) and 
admission_age were the five most important features affecting RF model. 
Therefore, RF has good predictive ability for 28-day mortality prediction in 
SALI. Urine output, CCI, GCS_min, BUN and age at admission(admission_age) within 
24 h after intensive care unit(ICU) admission contribute significantly to model 
prediction.

BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: Acute Kidney Injury (AKI) is a common and severe 
complication in patients diagnosed with sepsis. It is associated with higher 
mortality rates, prolonged hospital stays, increased utilization of medical 
resources, and financial burden on patients' families. This study aimed to 
establish and validate predictive models using machine learning algorithms to 
accurately predict the occurrence of AKI in patients diagnosed with sepsis.
METHODS: This retrospective study utilized real observational data from the 
Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care IV (MIMIC-IV) database. It included 
patients aged 18 to 90 years diagnosed with sepsis who were admitted to the ICU 
for the first time and had hospital stays exceeding 48 hours. Predictive models, 
employing various machine learning algorithms including Light Gradient Boosting 
Machine (LightGBM), EXtreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost), Random Forest (RF), 
Decision Tree (DT), Artificial Neural Network (ANN), Support Vector Machine 
(SVM), and Logistic Regression (LR), were developed. The dataset was randomly 
divided into training and test sets at a ratio of 4:1.
RESULTS: A total of 10,575 sepsis patients were included in the analysis, of 
whom 8,575 (81.1%) developed AKI during hospitalization. A selection of 47 
variables was utilized for model construction. The models derived from LightGBM, 
XGBoost, RF, DT, ANN, SVM, and LR achieved AUCs of 0.801, 0.773, 0.772, 0.737, 
0.720, 0.765, and 0.776, respectively. Among these models, LightGBM demonstrated 
the most superior predictive performance.
CONCLUSIONS: These machine learning models offer valuable predictive 
capabilities for identifying AKI in patients diagnosed with sepsis. The LightGBM 
model, with its superior predictive capability, could aid clinicians in early 
identification of high-risk patients.

BACKGROUND: This study aimed to create a method for promptly predicting acute 
kidney injury (AKI) in intensive care patients by applying interpretable, 
explainable artificial intelligence techniques.
METHODS: Population data regarding intensive care patients were derived from the 
Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care IV database from 2008 to 2019. 
Machine learning (ML) techniques with six methods were created to construct the 
predicted models for AKI. The performance of each ML model was evaluated by 
comparing the areas under the curve (AUC). Local Interpretable Model-Agnostic 
Explanations (LIME) method and Shapley Additive exPlanation values were used to 
decipher the best model.
RESULTS: According to inclusion and exclusion criteria, 53,150 severely sick 
individuals were included in the present study, of which 42,520 (80%) were 
assigned to the training group, and 10,630 (20%) were allocated to the 
validation group. Compared to the other five ML models, the eXtreme Gradient 
Boosting (XGBoost) model greatly predicted AKI following ICU admission, with an 
AUC of 0.816. The top four contributing variables of the XGBoost model were SOFA 
score, weight, mechanical ventilation, and the Simplified Acute Physiology Score 
II. An AKI and Non-AKI cases were predicted separately using the LIME algorithm.
CONCLUSION: Overall, the constructed clinical feature-based ML models are 
excellent in predicting AKI in intensive care patients. It would be constructive 
for physicians to provide early support and timely intervention measures to 
intensive care patients at risk of AKI.

The mortality rate of patients with sepsis-induced acute kidney injury (S-AKI) 
is notably elevated. The initial categorization of prognostic indicators has a 
beneficial impact on elucidating and enhancing disease outcomes. This study 
aimed to predict the mortality risk of S-AKI patients by employing machine 
learning techniques. The sample size determined by a four-step procedure yielded 
1508 samples. The research design necessitated the inclusion of individuals with 
S-AKI from the Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care (MIMIC)-IV database. 
The patients were initially admitted to the Intensive Care Unit (ICU) for their 
hospital stay. Additionally, these patients (aged from 18 to 89 years old) had 
encountered S-AKI on the day of their admittance. Forty-two predictive factors 
were analyzed, with hospitalization death as the outcome variable. The training 
set (4001 cases) consisted of 70 % of the participants, and the remaining (1714 
cases) participants were allocated to the validation set. Furthermore, an 
additional validation set (MIMIC-III) consisted of 1757 patients from the 
MIMIC-III database. Moreover, an external validation set from the Intensive Care 
Department of Beijing Friendship Hospital (BFH) comprised 72 patients. Six 
machine learning models were employed in the prediction, namely the logistic, 
lasso, rpart, random forest, xgboost, and artificial neural network models. The 
comparative efficacy of the newly developed model in relation to the APACHE II 
model for predicting mortality risk was also assessed. The XGBoost model 
exhibited a superior performance with the training set. With the internal 
validation set and the two external validation sets (MIMIC-III and BFH), the 
xgboost algorithm demonstrated the highest performance. Meanwhile, APACHE II 
performed poorly at predicting the mortality risk with the BFH validation set. 
The mortality risk was influenced by three primary clinical parameters: urine 
volume, lactate, and Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) score. Thus, we developed a 
prediction model for the risk of death among S-AKI patients that has an improved 
performance compared to previous models and is a potentially valuable tool for 
S-AKI prediction and treatment in the clinic.

PURPOSE: The purpose of the research is to design an algorithm to predict the 
occurrence of acute respiratory failure (ARF) in patients with acute 
pancreatitis (AP).
METHODS: We collected data on patients with AP in the Medical Information Mart 
for Intensive Care IV database. The enrolled observations were randomly divided 
into a 70 % training cohort and a 30 % validation cohort, and the observations 
in the training cohort were divided into ARF and non-ARF groups. Feature 
engineering was conducted using random forest (RF) and least absolute shrinkage 
and selection operator (LASSO) methods in the training cohort. The model 
building included logistic regression (LR), decision tree (DT), k-nearest 
neighbours (KNN), naive bayes (NB) and extreme gradient boosting (XGBoost). 
Parameters for model evaluation include receiver operating characteristic (ROC) 
curve, precision-recall curve (PRC), calibration curves, positive predictive 
value (PPV), negative predictive value (NPV), true positive rate (TPR), true 
negative rate (TNR), accuracy (ACC) and F1 score.
RESULTS: Among 4527 patients, 445 patients (9.8 %) experienced ARF. Ca, ALB, 
GLR, WBC, AG and BUN have been included in the prediction model as features for 
predicting ARF. The AUC of XGBoost were 0.86 (95 %CI 0.84-0.88) and 0.87 (95 %CI 
0.84-0.90) in the training and validation cohorts. In the training cohort, 
XGBoost demonstrates a true positive rate (TPR) of 0.662, a true negative rate 
(TNR) of 0.884, a positive predictive value (PPV) of 0.380, a negative 
predictive value (NPV) of 0.960, an accuracy (ACC) of 0.862, and an F1 score of 
0.483. In the validation cohort, XGBoost shows a TPR of 0.620, a TNR of 0.895, a 
PPV of 0.399, an NPV of 0.955, an ACC of 0.867, and an F1 score of 0.486.
CONCLUSION: The XGBOOST model demonstrates good discriminatory ability, which 
enables clinicians to ascertain the probability of developing ARF in AP 
patients.

Databases that link molecular data to clinical outcomes can inform precision 
cancer research into novel prognostic and predictive biomarkers. However, 
outside of clinical trials, cancer outcomes are typically recorded only in text 
form within electronic health records (EHRs). Artificial intelligence (AI) 
models have been trained to extract outcomes from individual EHRs. However, 
patient privacy restrictions have historically precluded dissemination of these 
models beyond the centers at which they were trained. In this study, the 
vulnerability of text classification models trained directly on protected health 
information to membership inference attacks is confirmed. A teacher-student 
distillation approach is applied to develop shareable models for annotating 
outcomes from imaging reports and medical oncologist notes. 'Teacher' models 
trained on EHR data from Dana-Farber Cancer Institute (DFCI) are used to label 
imaging reports and discharge summaries from the Medical Information Mart for 
Intensive Care (MIMIC)-IV dataset. 'Student' models are trained to use these 
MIMIC documents to predict the labels assigned by teacher models and sent to 
Memorial Sloan Kettering (MSK) for evaluation. The student models exhibit high 
discrimination across outcomes in both the DFCI and MSK test sets. Leveraging 
private labeling of public datasets to distill publishable clinical AI models 
from academic centers could facilitate deployment of machine learning to 
accelerate precision oncology research.

OBJECTIVES: Sepsis is an infection-caused syndrome, that leads to 
life-threatening organ damage. We aim to develop machine learning models with 
large-scale data to predict sepsis patients' mortality.
DESIGN: we extracted sepsis patients from two databases, Medical Information 
Mart for Intensive Care IV (MIMIC-IV) as a train set and Philips eICU 
Collaborative Research Database as a test set.
SETTING: ICUs in multicenter hospitals in the USA during 2012-2019.
PATIENTS OR PARTICIPANTS: A total of 21,680 sepsis-3 patients are included in 
the study, in which, 3771 patients were dead and 17,909 survived during 
hospitalization, respectively.
INTERVENTIONS: No interventions.
MAIN VARIABLES OF INTEREST: Basic information, examination items during 
hospitalization and some medication and treatment information are incorporated 
into analyzed. Seven different models were built with a Support vector machine, 
Decision Tree Classifier, Random Forest, Gradients Boosting, Multiple Layer 
Perception, Xgboost, light Gradients Boosting to predict dead or live during 
hospitalization.
RESULTS: Algorithms with an AUC value in the test set of the top three: light 
GBM, GBM, Xgboost. Considering the performance of the training set and the test 
set, the light GBM model performs best, and then the parameters of the model 
were adjusted, after that the AUC value was 0.99 in the train set, 0.96 in the 
test set, respectively.
CONCLUSIONS: Models built with light GBM algorithm from real-world sepsis 
patients from electronic health records accurately predict whether sepsis 
patients are dead and can be incorporated into clinical decision tools to 
enhance the prognosis of the patient and prevent adverse outcomes.

The recent release of large-scale healthcare datasets has greatly propelled the 
research of data-driven deep learning models for healthcare applications. 
However, due to the nature of such deep black-boxed models, concerns about 
interpretability, fairness, and biases in healthcare scenarios where human lives 
are at stake call for a careful and thorough examination of both datasets and 
models. In this work, we focus on MIMIC-IV (Medical Information Mart for 
Intensive Care, version IV), the largest publicly available healthcare dataset, 
and conduct comprehensive analyses of interpretability as well as dataset 
representation bias and prediction fairness of deep learning models for 
in-hospital mortality prediction. First, we analyze the interpretability of deep 
learning mortality prediction models and observe that (1) the best-performing 
interpretability method successfully identifies critical features for mortality 
prediction on various prediction models as well as recognizing new important 
features that domain knowledge does not consider; (2) prediction models rely on 
demographic features, raising concerns in fairness. Therefore, we then evaluate 
the fairness of models and do observe the unfairness: (1) there exists disparate 
treatment in prescribing mechanical ventilation among patient groups across 
ethnicity, gender and age; (2) models often rely on racial attributes unequally 
across subgroups to generate their predictions. We further draw concrete 
connections between interpretability methods and fairness metrics by showing how 
feature importance from interpretability methods can be beneficial in 
quantifying potential disparities in mortality predictors. Our analysis 
demonstrates that the prediction performance is not the only factor to consider 
when evaluating models for healthcare applications, since high prediction 
performance might be the result of unfair utilization of demographic features. 
Our findings suggest that future research in AI models for healthcare 
applications can benefit from utilizing the analysis workflow of 
interpretability and fairness as well as verifying if models achieve superior 
performance at the cost of introducing bias.

OBJECTIVES: Early hemorrhage detection in intensive care units (ICUs) enables 
timely intervention and reduces the risk of irreversible outcomes. In this 
study, we aimed to develop a machine learning model to predict hemorrhage by 
learning the patterns of continuously changing, real-world clinical data.
METHODS: We used the Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care databases 
(MIMIC-III and MIMIC-IV). A recurrent neural network was used to predict severe 
hemorrhage in the ICU. We developed three machine learning models with an 
increasing number of input features and levels of complexity: model 1 (11 
features), model 2 (18 features), and model 3 (27 features). MIMIC-III was used 
for model training, and MIMIC-IV was split for internal validation. Using the 
model with the highest performance, external verification was performed using 
data from a subgroup extracted from the eICU Collaborative Research Database.
RESULTS: We included 5,670 ICU admissions, with 3,150 in the training set and 
2,520 in the internal test set. A positive correlation was found between model 
complexity and performance. As a measure of performance, three models developed 
with an increasing number of features showed area under the receiver operating 
characteristic (AUROC) curve values of 0.61-0.94 according to the range of input 
data. In the subgroup extracted from the eICU database for external validation, 
an AUROC value of 0.74 was observed.
CONCLUSIONS: Machine learning models that rely on real clinical data can be used 
to predict patients at high risk of bleeding in the ICU.

BACKGROUND: The occurrence of acute kidney injury (AKI) was associated with an 
increased mortality rate among acute pancreatitis (AP) patients, indicating the 
importance of accurately predicting the mortality rate of critically ill 
patients with acute pancreatitis-associated acute kidney injury (AP-AKI) at an 
early stage. This study aimed to develop and validate machine learning-based 
predictive models for in-hospital mortality rate in critically ill patients with 
AP-AKI by comparing their performance with the traditional logistic regression 
(LR) model.
METHODS: This study used data from three clinical databases. The predictors were 
identified by the Recursive Feature Elimination algorithm. The LR and two 
machine learning models-random forest (RF) and eXtreme Gradient Boosting 
(XGBoost)-were developed using 10-fold cross-validation to predict in-hospital 
mortality rate in AP-AKI patients.
RESULTS: A total of 1089 patients from the Medical Information Mart for 
Intensive Care-IV (MIMIC-IV) and eICU Collaborative Research Database (eICU-CRD) 
were included in the training set and 176 patients from Xiangya Hospital were 
included in the external validation set. The in-hospital mortality rates of the 
training and external validation sets were 13.77% and 54.55%, respectively. 
Compared with the area under the curve (AUC) values of the LR model and the RF 
model, the AUC value of the XGBoost model {0.941 [95% confidence interval (CI) 
0.931-0.952]} was significantly higher (both P < .001) and the XGBoost model had 
the smallest Brier score of 0.039 in the training set. In the external 
validation set, the performance of the XGBoost model was acceptable, with an AUC 
value of 0.724 (95% CI 0.648-0.800). However, it did not differ significantly 
from the LR and RF models.
CONCLUSIONS: The XGBoost model was superior to the LR and RF models in terms of 
both the discrimination and calibration in the training set. Whether the 
findings can be generalized needs to be further validated.

Background: Traumatic brain injury-induced coagulopathy (TBI-IC), is a disease 
with poor prognosis and increased mortality rate. Objectives: Our study aimed to 
identify predictors as well as develop machine learning (ML) models to predict 
the risk of coagulopathy in this population. Methods: ML models were developed 
and validated based on two public databases named Medical Information Mart for 
Intensive Care (MIMIC)-IV and the eICU Collaborative Research Database 
(eICU-CRD). Candidate predictors, including demographics, family history, 
comorbidities, vital signs, laboratory findings, injury type, therapy strategy 
and scoring system were included. Models were compared on area under the curve 
(AUC), accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, positive and negative predictive 
values, and decision curve analysis (DCA) curve. Results: Of 999 patients in 
MIMIC-IV included in the final cohort, a total of 493 (49.35%) patients 
developed coagulopathy following TBI. Recursive feature elimination (RFE) 
selected 15 variables, including international normalized ratio (INR), 
prothrombin time (PT), sepsis related organ failure assessment (SOFA), activated 
partial thromboplastin time (APTT), platelet (PLT), hematocrit (HCT), red blood 
cell (RBC), hemoglobin (HGB), blood urea nitrogen (BUN), red blood cell volume 
distribution width (RDW), creatinine (CRE), congestive heart failure, myocardial 
infarction, sodium, and blood transfusion. The external validation in eICU-CRD 
demonstrated that adapting boosting (Ada) model had the highest AUC of 0.924 
(95% CI: 0.902-0.943). Furthermore, in the DCA curve, the Ada model and the 
extreme Gradient Boosting (XGB) model had relatively higher net benefits (ie, 
the correct classification of coagulopathy considering a trade-off between 
false- negatives and false-positives)-over other models across a range of 
threshold probability values. Conclusions: The ML models, as indicated by our 
study, can be used to predict the incidence of TBI-IC in the intensive care unit 
(ICU).

PIC (Paediatric Intensive Care) is a large paediatric-specific, single-centre, 
bilingual database comprising information relating to children admitted to 
critical care units at a large children's hospital in China. The database is 
deidentified and includes vital sign measurements, medications, laboratory 
measurements, fluid balance, diagnostic codes, length of hospital stays, 
survival data, and more. The data are publicly available after registration, 
which includes completion of a training course on research with human subjects 
and signing of a data use agreement mandating responsible handling of the data 
and adherence to the principle of collaborative research. Although the PIC can 
be considered an extension of the widely used MIMIC (Medical Information Mart 
for Intensive Care) database in the field of paediatric critical care, it has 
many unique characteristics and can support database-based academic and 
industrial applications such as machine learning algorithms, clinical decision 
support tools, quality improvement initiatives, and international data sharing.

Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) poses significant morbidity 
and mortality in hospitals. Rapid, accurate risk stratification of MRSA is 
crucial for optimizing antibiotic therapy. Our study introduced a deep learning 
model, PyTorch_EHR, which leverages electronic health record (EHR) time-series 
data, including wide-variety patient specific data, to predict MRSA culture 
positivity within two weeks. 8,164 MRSA and 22,393 non-MRSA patient events from 
Memorial Hermann Hospital System, Houston, Texas are used for model development. 
PyTorch_EHR outperforms logistic regression (LR) and light gradient boost 
machine (LGBM) models in accuracy (AUROCPyTorch_EHR = 0.911, AUROCLR = 0.857, 
AUROCLGBM = 0.892). External validation with 393,713 patient events from the 
Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care (MIMIC)-IV dataset in Boston 
confirms its superior accuracy (AUROCPyTorch_EHR = 0.859, AUROCLR = 0.816, 
AUROCLGBM = 0.838). Our model effectively stratifies patients into high-, 
medium-, and low-risk categories, potentially optimizing antimicrobial therapy 
and reducing unnecessary MRSA-specific antimicrobials. This highlights the 
advantage of deep learning models in predicting MRSA positive cultures, 
surpassing traditional machine learning models and supporting clinicians' 
judgments.

AIMS: This study aims to develop explainable machine learning models and 
clinical tools for predicting mortality in patients in the intensive care unit 
(ICU) with heart failure (HF).
METHODS: Patients diagnosed with HF who experienced their first ICU stay lasting 
between 24 h and 28 days were selected from the Medical Information Mart for 
Intensive Care IV (MIMIC-IV) database. The primary outcome was all-cause 
mortality within 28 days. Data analysis was performed using Python and R, with 
feature selection conducted via least absolute shrinkage and selection operator 
(LASSO) regression. Fifteen models were evaluated, and the most effective model 
was rendered explainable through the Shapley additive explanations (SHAP) 
approach. A nomogram was developed based on logistic regression to facilitate 
interpretation. For external validation, the eICU database was utilized.
RESULTS: After selection, the study included 2343 records, with 1808 surviving 
and 535 deceased patients. The median age of the study population was 70.00, 
with ~3/5 males (60.31%). The median length of stay in the ICU was 6.00 days. 
The median age of the survival group was younger than the non-survival group 
(69.00 vs. 73.00), and non-survival patients spent longer time in the ICU. 
Seventy-five features were initially selected, including basic information, 
vital signs, laboratory tests, haemodynamics and oxygen status. LASSO regression 
determined the shrinkage parameter α = 0.020, and 44 features were chosen for 
model construction. The linear discriminant analysis (LDA) model showed the best 
performance, and the accuracy reached 0.8354 in the training cohort and 0.8563 
in the testing cohort. It showed satisfying area under the curve (AUC), recall, 
precision, F1 score, Cohen's kappa score and Matthew's correlation coefficient. 
The concordance index (c-index) reached 0.7972 in the training cohort and 0.8125 
in the testing cohort. In external validation, the LDA model achieved 
approximately 0.9 in accuracy, precision, recall and F1 score, with an AUC of 
0.79. Univariable analysis was performed in the training cohort. Features that 
differed significantly between the survival and non-survival groups were 
subjected to multiple logistic regression. The nomogram built on multiple 
logistic regression included 14 features and demonstrated excellent performance. 
The AUC of the nomogram is 0.852 in the training cohort, 0.855 in the internal 
validation cohort and 0.770 in the external validation cohort. The calibration 
curve showed good consistency.
CONCLUSIONS: The study developed an LDA and a nomogram model for predicting 
mortality in HF patients in the ICU. The SHAP approach was employed to elucidate 
the LDA model, enhancing its utility for clinicians. These models were made 
accessible online for clinical application.

OBJECTIVE: The management of cardiogenic shock (CS) in the elderly remains a 
major clinical challenge. Existing clinical prediction models have not performed 
well in assessing the prognosis of elderly patients with CS. This study aims to 
build a predictive model, which could better predict the 30-day mortality of 
elderly patients with CS.
METHODS: We extracted data from the Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care 
III version 1.4 (MIMIC-III) as the training set and the data of validation sets 
were collected from the Second Affiliated Hospital and Yuying Children's 
Hospital of Wenzhou Medical University. Three models, including the cox 
regression model, the Least Absolute Shrinkage and Selection Operator (LASSO) 
regression model, and the CoxBoost model, were established using the training 
set. Through the comparison of area under the receiver operating characteristic 
(ROC) curve (AUC), C index, net reclassification improvement (NRI), integrated 
discrimination improvement (IDI), and median improvement in risk score, the best 
model was selected. Then for external validation, compared the best model with 
the simplified acute physiology score II (SAPSII) and the CardShock risk score.
RESULTS: A total of 919 patients were included in the study, of which 804 
patients were in the training set and 115 patients were in the verification set. 
Using the training set, we built three models: the cox regression model 
including 6 predictors, the LASSO regression model including 4 predictors, and 
the CoxBoost model including 16 predictors. Among them, the CoxBoost model had 
good discrimination [AUC: 0.730; C index: 0.6958 (0.6657, 0.7259)]. Compared 
with the CoxBoost model, the NRI, IDI, and median improvement in risk score of 
other models were all<0. In the validation set, the CoxBoost model was also 
well-discriminated [AUC: 0.770; C index: 0.7713 (0.6751, 0.8675)]. Compared with 
the CoxBoost model, the NRI, IDI, and median improvement in risk score of SAPS 
II and the CardShock risk score were all < 0. And we constructed a dynamic 
nomogram to visually display the model.
CONCLUSION: In conclusion, this study showed that in predicting the 30-day 
mortality of elderly CS patients, the CoxBoost model was superior to the Cox 
regression model, LASSO regression model, SAPS II, and the CardShock risk score.

BACKGROUND: This study aimed to develop an algorithm using the explainable 
artificial intelligence (XAI) approaches for the early prediction of mortality 
in intensive care unit (ICU) patients with acute kidney injury (AKI).
METHODS: This study gathered clinical data with AKI patients from the Medical 
Information Mart for Intensive Care IV (MIMIC-IV) in the US between 2008 and 
2019. All the data were further randomly divided into a training cohort and a 
validation cohort. Seven machine learning methods were used to develop the 
models for assessing in-hospital mortality. The optimal model was selected based 
on its accuracy and area under the curve (AUC). The SHapley Additive exPlanation 
(SHAP) values and Local Interpretable Model-Agnostic Explanations (LIME) 
algorithm were utilized to interpret the optimal model.
RESULTS: A total of 22,360 patients with AKI were finally enrolled in this study 
(median age, 69.5 years; female, 42.8%). They were randomly split into a 
training cohort (16770, 75%) and a validation cohort (5590, 25%). The eXtreme 
Gradient Boosting (XGBoost) model achieved the best performance with an AUC of 
0.890. The SHAP values showed that Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS), blood urea 
nitrogen, cumulative urine output on Day 1 and age were the top 4 most important 
variables contributing to the XGBoost model. The LIME algorithm was used to 
explain the individualized predictions.
CONCLUSIONS: Machine-learning models based on clinical features were developed 
and validated with great performance for the early prediction of a high risk of 
death in patients with AKI.

The prime purpose of the proposed study is to construct a novel predictive 
scheme for assisting in the prognosis of criticality using the MIMIC-III 
dataset. With the adoption of various analytics and advanced computing in the 
healthcare system, there is an increasing trend toward developing an effective 
prognostication mechanism. Predictive-based modeling is the best alternative to 
work in this direction. This paper discusses various scientific contributions 
using desk research methodology towards the Medical Information Mart for 
Intensive Care (MIMIC-III). This open-access dataset is meant to help predict 
patient trajectories for various purposes ranging from mortality forecasting to 
treatment planning. With a dominant machine learning approach in this 
perspective, there is a need to discover the effectiveness of existing 
predictive methods. The resultant outcome of this paper offers an inclusive 
discussion about various available predictive schemes and clinical diagnoses 
using MIMIC-III in order to contribute toward better information associated with 
its strengths and weaknesses. Therefore, the paper provides a clear 
visualization of existing schemes for clinical diagnosis using a systematic 
review approach.

BACKGROUND: Multidrug-resistant organisms (MDRO) pose a significant threat to 
public health. Intensive Care Units (ICU), characterized by the extensive use of 
antimicrobial agents and a high prevalence of bacterial resistance, are hotspots 
for MDRO proliferation. Timely identification of patients at high risk for MDRO 
can aid in curbing transmission, enhancing patient outcomes, and maintaining the 
cleanliness of the ICU environment. This study focused on developing a machine 
learning (ML) model to identify patients at risk of MDRO during the initial 
phase of their ICU stay.
METHODS: Utilizing patient data from the First Medical Center of the People's 
Liberation Army General Hospital (PLAGH-ICU) and the Medical Information Mart 
for Intensive Care (MIMIC-IV), the study analyzed variables within 24 h of ICU 
admission. Machine learning algorithms were applied to these datasets, 
emphasizing the early detection of MDRO colonization or infection. Model 
efficacy was evaluated by the area under the receiver operating characteristics 
curve (AUROC), alongside internal and external validation sets.
RESULTS: The study evaluated 3,536 patients in PLAGH-ICU and 34,923 in MIMIC-IV, 
revealing MDRO prevalence of 11.96% and 8.81%, respectively. Significant 
differences in ICU and hospital stays, along with mortality rates, were observed 
between MDRO positive and negative patients. In the temporal validation, the 
PLAGH-ICU model achieved an AUROC of 0.786 [0.748, 0.825], while the MIMIC-IV 
model reached 0.744 [0.723, 0.766]. External validation demonstrated reduced 
model performance across different datasets. Key predictors included biochemical 
markers and the duration of pre-ICU hospital stay.
CONCLUSIONS: The ML models developed in this study demonstrated their capability 
in early identification of MDRO risks in ICU patients. Continuous refinement and 
validation in varied clinical contexts remain essential for future applications.

With the growing interest of researchers in machine learning and artificial 
intelligence (AI) based on large data, their roles in medical research have 
become increasingly prominent. Despite the proliferation of predictive models in 
perioperative medicine, external validation is lacking. Open datasets, defined 
as publicly available datasets for research, play a crucial role by providing 
high-quality data, facilitating collaboration, and allowing an objective 
evaluation of the developed models. Among the available datasets for surgical 
patients, VitalDB has been the most widely used, with the Medical Informatics 
Operating Room Vitals and Events Repository recently launched and the 
Informative Surgical Patient dataset for Innovative Research Environment 
expected to be released soon. For critically ill patients, the available 
resources include the Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care, the eICU 
Collaborative Research Database, the Amsterdam University Medical Centers 
Database, and the High time Resolution ICU Dataset, with the anticipated release 
of the Intensive Care Network with Million Patients' information for the AI 
Clinical decision support system Technology dataset. This review presents a 
detailed comparison of each to enrich our understanding of these open datasets 
for data science and AI research in perioperative medicine.

BACKGROUND: Atrial fibrillation (AF) is common among intensive care unit (ICU) 
patients and significantly raises the in-hospital mortality rate. Existing 
scoring systems or models have limited predictive capabilities for AF patients 
in ICU. Our study developed and validated machine learning models to predict the 
risk of in-hospital mortality in ICU patients with AF.
METHODS AND RESULTS: Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care (MIMIC)-IV 
dataset and eICU Collaborative Research Database (eICU-CRD) were analyzed. Among 
ten classifiers compared, adaptive boosting (AdaBoost) showed better performance 
in predicting all-cause mortality in AF patients. A compact model with 15 
features was developed and validated. Both the all variable and compact models 
exhibited excellent performance with area under the receiver operating 
characteristic curves (AUCs) of 1(95%confidence interval [CI]: 1.0-1.0) in the 
training set. In the MIMIC-IV testing set, the AUCs of the all variable and 
compact models were 0.978 (95% CI: 0.973-0.982) and 0.977 (95% CI: 0.972-0.982), 
respectively. In the external validation set, the AUCs of all variable and 
compact models were 0.825 (95% CI: 0.815-0.834) and 0.807 (95% CI: 0.796-0.817), 
respectively.
CONCLUSION: An AdaBoost-based predictive model was subjected to internal and 
external validation, highlighting its strong predictive capacity for assessing 
the risk of in-hospital mortality in ICU patients with AF.

Continuous vital signal monitoring is becoming more relevant in preventing 
diseases that afflict a large part of the world's population; for this reason, 
healthcare equipment should be easy to wear and simple to use. Non-intrusive and 
non-invasive detection methods are a basic requirement for wearable medical 
devices, especially when these are used in sports applications or by the elderly 
for self-monitoring. Arterial blood pressure (ABP) is an essential physiological 
parameter for health monitoring. Most blood pressure measurement devices 
determine the systolic and diastolic arterial blood pressure through the 
inflation and the deflation of a cuff. This technique is uncomfortable for the 
user and may result in anxiety, and consequently affect the blood pressure and 
its measurement. The purpose of this paper is the continuous measurement of the 
ABP through a cuffless, non-intrusive approach. The approach of this paper is 
based on deep learning techniques where several neural networks are used to 
infer ABP, starting from photoplethysmogram (PPG) and electrocardiogram (ECG) 
signals. The ABP was predicted first by utilizing only PPG and then by using 
both PPG and ECG. Convolutional neural networks (ResNet and WaveNet) and 
recurrent neural networks (LSTM) were compared and analyzed for the regression 
task. Results show that the use of the ECG has resulted in improved performance 
for every proposed configuration. The best performing configuration was obtained 
with a ResNet followed by three LSTM layers: this led to a mean absolute error 
(MAE) of 4.118 mmHg on and 2.228 mmHg on systolic and diastolic blood pressures, 
respectively. The results comply with the American National Standards of the 
Association for the Advancement of Medical Instrumentation. ECG, PPG, and ABP 
measurements were extracted from the MIMIC database, which contains clinical 
signal data reflecting real measurements. The results were validated on a custom 
dataset created at Neuronica Lab, Politecnico di Torino.

Increasingly available open medical and health datasets encourage data-driven 
research with a promise of improving patient care through knowledge discovery 
and algorithm development. Among efficient approaches to such high-dimensional 
problems are a number of machine learning methods, which are applied in this 
paper to pressure ulcer prediction in modular critical care data. An inherent 
property of many health-related datasets is a high number of irregularly sampled 
time-variant and scarcely populated features, often exceeding the number of 
observations. Although machine learning methods are known to work well under 
such circumstances, many choices regarding model and data processing exist. In 
particular, this paper address both theoretical and practical aspects related to 
the application of six classification models to pressure ulcers, while utilizing 
one of the largest available Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care 
(MIMIC-IV) databases. Random forest, with an accuracy of 96%, is the 
best-performing approach among the considered machine learning algorithms.

BACKGROUND: Sepsis-associated encephalopathy (SAE) is defined as diffuse brain 
dysfunction associated with sepsis and leads to a high mortality rate. We aimed 
to develop and validate an optimal machine-learning model based on clinical 
features for early predicting sepsis-associated acute brain injury.
METHODS: We analyzed adult patients with sepsis from the Medical Information 
Mart for Intensive Care (MIMIC III) clinical database. Candidate models were 
trained using random forest, support vector machine (SVM), decision tree 
classifier, gradients boosting machine (GBM), multiple layer perception (MLP), 
extreme gradient boosting (XGBoost), light gradients boosting machine (LGBM) and 
a conventional logistic regression model. These methods were applied to develop 
and validate the optimal model based on its accuracy and area under curve (AUC).
RESULTS: In total, 12,460 patients with sepsis met inclusion criteria, and 6,284 
(50.4%) patients suffered from sepsis-associated acute brain injury. Compared 
other models, the LGBM model achieved the best performance. The AUC for both 
train set and test set indicated excellent validity (Trainset AUC 0.91, Testset 
AUC 0.87). Feature importance analysis showed that glucose, age, mean arterial 
pressure, heart rate, hemoglobin, and length of ICU stay were the top 6 
important clinical factors to predict occurrence of sepsis-associated acute 
brain injury.
CONCLUSION: Almost half of patients admitted to ICU with sepsis had 
sepsis-associated acute brain injury. The LGBM model better identify patients 
with sepsis-associated acute brain injury than did other machine-learning 
models. Glucose, age, and mean arterial pressure were the three most important 
clinical factors to predict occurrence of sepsis-associated acute brain injury.

The evolution of intracranial pressure (ICP) of critically ill patients admitted 
to a neurointensive care unit (ICU) is difficult to predict. Besides the 
underlying disease and compromised intracranial space, ICP is affected by a 
multitude of factors, many of which are monitored on the ICU, but the complexity 
of the resulting patterns limits their clinical use. This paves the way for new 
machine learning techniques to assist clinical management of patients undergoing 
invasive ICP monitoring independent of the underlying disease. An institutional 
cohort (ICP-ICU) of patients with invasive ICP monitoring (n = 1346) was used to 
train recurrent machine learning models to predict the occurrence of ICP 
increases of ≥22 mmHg over a long (>2 h) time period in the upcoming hours. 
External validation was performed on patients undergoing invasive ICP 
measurement in two publicly available datasets [Medical Information Mart for 
Intensive Care (MIMIC, n = 998) and eICU Collaborative Research Database 
(n = 1634)]. Different distances (1-24 h) between prediction time point and 
upcoming critical phase were evaluated, demonstrating a decrease in performance 
but still robust AUC-ROC with larger distances (24 h AUC-ROC: ICP-ICU 
0.826 ± 0.0071, MIMIC 0.836 ± 0.0063, eICU 0.779 ± 0.0046, 1 h AUC-ROC: ICP-ICU 
0.982 ± 0.0008, MIMIC 0.965 ± 0.0010, eICU 0.941 ± 0.0025). The model operates 
on sparse hourly data and is stable in handling variable input lengths and 
missingness through its nature of recurrence and internal memory. Calculation of 
gradient-based feature importance revealed individual underlying decisions for 
our long short time memory-based model and thereby provided improved clinical 
interpretability. Recurrent machine learning models have the potential to be an 
effective tool for the prediction of ICP increases with high translational 
potential.

OBJECTIVE: This study aims to construct and validate several machine learning 
(ML) algorithms to predict long-term mortality and identify risk factors in 
unselected patients post-cardiac surgery.
METHODS: The Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care (MIMIC-III) database 
was used to perform a retrospective administrative database study. Candidate 
predictors consisted of the demographics, comorbidity, vital signs, laboratory 
test results, scoring systems, and treatment information on the first day of ICU 
admission. Four-year mortality was set as the study outcome. We used the ML 
methods of logistic regression (LR), artificial neural network (NNET), naïve 
bayes (NB), gradient boosting machine (GBM), adapting boosting (Ada), random 
forest (RF), bagged trees (BT), and eXtreme Gradient Boosting (XGB). The 
prognostic capacity and clinical utility of these ML models were compared using 
the area under the receiver operating characteristic curves (AUC), calibration 
curves, and decision curve analysis (DCA).
RESULTS: Of 7,368 patients in MIMIC-III included in the final cohort, a total of 
1,337 (18.15%) patients died during a 4-year follow-up. Among 65 variables 
extracted from the database, a total of 25 predictors were selected using 
recursive feature elimination and included in the subsequent analysis. The Ada 
model performed best among eight models in both discriminatory ability with the 
highest AUC of 0.801 and goodness of fit (visualized by calibration curve). 
Moreover, the DCA shows that the net benefit of the RF, Ada, and BT models 
surpassed that of other ML models for almost all threshold probability values. 
Additionally, through the Ada technique, we determined that red blood cell 
distribution width (RDW), blood urea nitrogen (BUN), SAPS II, anion gap (AG), 
age, urine output, chloride, creatinine, congestive heart failure, and SOFA were 
the Top 10 predictors in the feature importance rankings.
CONCLUSIONS: The Ada model performs best in predicting 4-year mortality after 
cardiac surgery among the eight ML models, which might have significant 
application in the development of early warning systems for patients following 
operations.

BACKGROUND: There is a continual push for developing accurate predictors for 
Intensive Care Unit (ICU) admitted heart failure (HF) patients and in-hospital 
mortality.
OBJECTIVE: The study aimed to utilize transparent machine learning and create 
hierarchical clustering of key predictors based off of model importance 
statistics gain, cover, and frequency.
METHODS: Inclusion criteria of complete patient information for in-hospital 
mortality in the ICU with HF from the MIMIC-III database were randomly divided 
into a training (n = 941, 80%) and test (n = 235, 20%). A grid search was set to 
find hyperparameters. Machine Learning with XGBoost were used to predict 
mortality followed by feature importance with Shapely Additive Explanations 
(SHAP) and hierarchical clustering of model metrics with a dendrogram and heat 
map.
RESULTS: Of the 1,176 heart failure ICU patients that met inclusion criteria for 
the study, 558 (47.5%) were males. The mean age was 74.05 (SD = 12.85). XGBoost 
model had an area under the receiver operator curve of 0.662. The highest 
overall SHAP explanations were urine output, leukocytes, bicarbonate, and 
platelets. Average urine output was 1899.28 (SD = 1272.36) mL/day with the 
hospital mortality group having 1345.97 (SD = 1136.58) mL/day and the group 
without hospital mortality having 1986.91 (SD = 1271.16) mL/day. The average 
leukocyte count in the cohort was 10.72 (SD = 5.23) cells per microliter. For 
the hospital mortality group the leukocyte count was 13.47 (SD = 7.42) cells per 
microliter and for the group without hospital mortality the leukocyte count was 
10.28 (SD = 4.66) cells per microliter. The average bicarbonate value was 26.91 
(SD = 5.17) mEq/L. Amongst the group with hospital mortality the average 
bicarbonate value was 24.00 (SD = 5.42) mEq/L. Amongst the group without 
hospital mortality the average bicarbonate value was 27.37 (SD = 4.98) mEq/L. 
The average platelet value was 241.52 platelets per microliter. For the group 
with hospital mortality the average platelet value was 216.21 platelets per 
microliter. For the group without hospital mortality the average platelet value 
was 245.47 platelets per microliter. Cluster 1 of the dendrogram grouped the 
temperature, platelets, urine output, Saturation of partial pressure of Oxygen 
(SPO2), Leukocyte count, lymphocyte count, bicarbonate, anion gap, respiratory 
rate, PCO2, BMI, and age as most similar in having the highest aggregate gain, 
cover, and frequency metrics.
CONCLUSION: Machine Learning models that incorporate dendrograms and heat maps 
can offer additional summaries of model statistics in differentiating factors 
between in patient ICU mortality in heart failure patients.

BACKGROUND: Gastrointestinal bleeding is a serious adverse event of coronary 
artery bypass grafting and lacks tailored risk assessment tools for personalized 
prevention.
OBJECTIVE: This study aims to develop and validate predictive models to assess 
the risk of gastrointestinal bleeding after coronary artery bypass grafting 
(GIBCG) and to guide personalized prevention.
METHODS: Participants were recruited from 4 medical centers, including a 
prospective cohort and the Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care IV 
(MIMIC-IV) database. From an initial cohort of 18,938 patients, 16,440 were 
included in the final analysis after applying the exclusion criteria. Thirty 
combinations of machine learning algorithms were compared, and the optimal model 
was selected based on integrated performance metrics, including the area under 
the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUROC) and the Brier score. This 
model was then developed into a web-based risk prediction calculator. The 
Shapley Additive Explanations method was used to provide both global and local 
explanations for the predictions.
RESULTS: The model was developed using data from 3 centers and a prospective 
cohort (n=13,399) and validated on the Drum Tower cohort (n=2745) and the MIMIC 
cohort (n=296). The optimal model, based on 15 easily accessible admission 
features, demonstrated an AUROC of 0.8482 (95% CI 0.8328-0.8618) in the 
derivation cohort. In external validation, the AUROC was 0.8513 (95% CI 
0.8221-0.8782) for the Drum Tower cohort and 0.7811 (95% CI 0.7275-0.8343) for 
the MIMIC cohort. The analysis indicated that high-risk patients identified by 
the model had a significantly increased mortality risk (odds ratio 2.98, 95% CI 
1.784-4.978; P<.001). For these high-risk populations, preoperative use of 
proton pump inhibitors was an independent protective factor against the 
occurrence of GIBCG. By contrast, dual antiplatelet therapy and oral 
anticoagulants were identified as independent risk factors. However, in low-risk 
populations, the use of proton pump inhibitors (χ21=0.13, P=.72), dual 
antiplatelet therapy (χ21=0.38, P=.54), and oral anticoagulants (χ21=0.15, 
P=.69) were not significantly associated with the occurrence of GIBCG.
CONCLUSIONS: Our machine learning model accurately identified patients at high 
risk of GIBCG, who had a poor prognosis. This approach can aid in early risk 
stratification and personalized prevention.

Background Clinicians consider both imaging and nonimaging data when diagnosing 
diseases; however, current machine learning approaches primarily consider data 
from a single modality. Purpose To develop a neural network architecture capable 
of integrating multimodal patient data and compare its performance to models 
incorporating a single modality for diagnosing up to 25 pathologic conditions. 
Materials and Methods In this retrospective study, imaging and nonimaging 
patient data were extracted from the Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care 
(MIMIC) database and an internal database comprised of chest radiographs and 
clinical parameters inpatients in the intensive care unit (ICU) (January 2008 to 
December 2020). The MIMIC and internal data sets were each split into training 
(n = 33 893, n = 28 809), validation (n = 740, n = 7203), and test (n = 1909, n 
= 9004) sets. A novel transformer-based neural network architecture was trained 
to diagnose up to 25 conditions using nonimaging data alone, imaging data alone, 
or multimodal data. Diagnostic performance was assessed using area under the 
receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) analysis. Results The MIMIC and 
internal data sets included 36 542 patients (mean age, 63 years ± 17 [SD]; 
20 567 male patients) and 45 016 patients (mean age, 66 years ± 16; 27 577 male 
patients), respectively. The multimodal model showed improved diagnostic 
performance for all pathologic conditions. For the MIMIC data set, the mean AUC 
was 0.77 (95% CI: 0.77, 0.78) when both chest radiographs and clinical 
parameters were used, compared with 0.70 (95% CI: 0.69, 0.71; P < .001) for only 
chest radiographs and 0.72 (95% CI: 0.72, 0.73; P < .001) for only clinical 
parameters. These findings were confirmed on the internal data set. Conclusion A 
model trained on imaging and nonimaging data outperformed models trained on only 
one type of data for diagnosing multiple diseases in patients in an ICU setting.

BackgroundTo develop and validate a mortality prediction model for patients with 
sepsis-associated Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS).MethodsThis 
retrospective cohort study included 2466 patients diagnosed with sepsis and ARDS 
within 24 h of ICU admission. Demographic, clinical, and laboratory parameters 
were extracted from Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care III (MIMIC-III) 
database. Feature selection was performed using the Boruta algorithm, followed 
by the construction of seven ML models: logistic regression, Naive Bayes, 
k-nearest neighbor, support vector machine, decision tree, Random Forest, and 
extreme gradient boosting. Model performance was evaluated using the area under 
the receiver operating characteristic curve, accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, 
positive predictive value, and negative predictive value.ResultsThe study 
identified 24 variables significantly associated with mortality. The optimal ML 
model, a Random Forest model, demonstrated an AUC of 0.8015 in the test set, 
with high accuracy and specificity. The model highlighted the importance of 
blood urea nitrogen, age, urine output, Simplified Acute Physiology Score II, 
and albumin levels in predicting mortality.ConclusionsThe model's superior 
predictive performance underscores the potential for integrating advanced 
analytics into clinical decision-making processes, potentially improving patient 
outcomes and resource allocation in critical care settings.

OBJECTIVE: Acute kidney injury after cardiac surgery increases morbidity and 
mortality. Diagnosis relies on oliguria or increased serum creatinine, which 
develop 48 to 72 hours after injury. We hypothesized machine learning 
incorporating preoperative, operative, and intensive care unit data could 
dynamically predict acute kidney injury before conventional identification.
METHODS: Cardiac surgery patients at a tertiary hospital (2008-2019) were 
identified using electronic medical records in the Medical Information Mart for 
Intensive Care IV database. Preoperative and intraoperative parameters included 
demographics, Charlson Comorbidity subcategories, and operative details. 
Intensive care unit data included hemodynamics, medications, fluid 
intake/output, and laboratory results. Kidney Disease: Improving Global Outcomes 
creatinine criteria were used for acute kidney injury diagnosis. An ensemble 
machine learning model was trained for hourly predictions of future acute kidney 
injury within 48 hours. Performance was evaluated by area under the receiver 
operating characteristic curve and balanced accuracy.
RESULTS: Within the cohort (n = 4267), there were approximately 7 million data 
points. Median baseline creatinine was 1.0 g/dL (interquartile range, 0.8-1.2), 
with 17% (735/4267) of patients having chronic kidney disease. Postoperative 
stage 1 acute kidney injury occurred in 50% (2129/4267), stage 2 occurred in 8% 
(324/4267), and stage 3 occurred in 4% (183/4267). For hourly prediction of any 
acute kidney injury over the next 48 hours, area under the receiver operating 
characteristic curve was 0.82, and balanced accuracy was 75%. For hourly 
prediction of stage 2 or greater acute kidney injury over the next 48 hours, 
area under the receiver operating characteristic curve was 0.95 and balanced 
accuracy was 86%. The model predicted acute kidney injury before clinical 
detection in 89% of cases.
CONCLUSIONS: Ensemble machine learning models using electronic medical records 
data can dynamically predict acute kidney injury risk after cardiac surgery. 
Continuous postoperative risk assessment could facilitate interventions to limit 
or prevent renal injury.

BACKGROUND: The number of studies applying machine learning (ML) to predict 
acute kidney injury (AKI) has grown steadily over the past decade. We assess and 
critically appraise the state of the art in ML models for AKI prediction, 
considering performance, methodological soundness, and applicability.
METHODS: We searched PubMed and ArXiv, extracted data, and critically appraised 
studies based on the Transparent Reporting of a Multivariable Prediction Model 
for Individual Prognosis or Diagnosis (TRIPOD), Checklist for Critical Appraisal 
and Data Extraction for Systematic Reviews of Prediction Modelling Studies 
(CHARMS), and Prediction Model Risk of Bias Assessment Tool (PROBAST) 
guidelines.
RESULTS: Forty-six studies from 3166 titles were included. Thirty-eight studies 
developed a model, five developed and externally validated one, and three 
studies externally validated one. Flexible ML methods were used more often than 
deep learning, although the latter was common with temporal variables and text 
as predictors. Predictive performance showed an area under receiver operating 
curves ranging from 0.49 to 0.99. Our critical appraisal identified a high risk 
of bias in 39 studies. Some studies lacked internal validation, whereas external 
validation and interpretability of results were rarely considered. Fifteen 
studies focused on AKI prediction in the intensive care setting, and the 
US-derived Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care (MIMIC) data set was 
commonly used. Reproducibility was limited as data and code were usually 
unavailable.
CONCLUSIONS: Flexible ML methods are popular for the prediction of AKI, although 
more complex models based on deep learning are emerging. Our critical appraisal 
identified a high risk of bias in most models: Studies should use calibration 
measures and external validation more often, improve model interpretability, and 
share data and code to improve reproducibility.

BACKGROUND: The objective of this study was to develop and validate a machine 
learning (ML) model for predict in-hospital mortality among critically ill 
patients with congestive heart failure (CHF) combined with chronic kidney 
disease (CKD).
METHODS: After employing least absolute shrinkage and selection operator 
regression for feature selection, six distinct methodologies were employed in 
the construction of the model. The selection of the optimal model was based on 
the area under the curve (AUC). Furthermore, the interpretation of the chosen 
model was facilitated through the utilization of SHapley Additive exPlanation 
(SHAP) values and the Local Interpretable Model-Agnostic Explanations (LIME) 
algorithm.
RESULTS: This study collected data and enrolled 5041 patients on CHF combined 
with CKD from 2008 to 2019, utilizing the Medical Information Mart for Intensive 
Care Unit. After selection, 22 of the 47 variables collected post-intensive care 
unit admission were identified as mortality-associated and subsequently utilized 
in the development of ML models. Among the six models generated, the eXtreme 
Gradient Boosting (XGBoost) model demonstrated the highest AUC at 0.837. 
Notably, the SHAP values highlighted the sequential organ failure assessment 
score, age, simplified acute physiology score II, and urine output as the four 
most influential variables in the XGBoost model. In addition, the LIME algorithm 
explains the individualized predictions.
CONCLUSIONS: In conclusion, our study accomplished the successful development 
and validation of ML models for predicting in-hospital mortality in critically 
ill patients with CHF combined with CKD. Notably, the XGBoost model emerged as 
the most efficacious among all the ML models employed.

Background: Sepsis-induced coagulopathy (SIC) denotes an increased mortality 
rate and poorer prognosis in septic patients. Objectives: Our study aimed to 
develop and validate machine-learning models to dynamically predict the risk of 
SIC in critically ill patients with sepsis. Methods: Machine-learning models 
were developed and validated based on two public databases named Medical 
Information Mart for Intensive Care (MIMIC)-IV and the eICU Collaborative 
Research Database (eICU-CRD). Dynamic prediction of SIC involved an evaluation 
of the risk of SIC each day after the diagnosis of sepsis using 15 predictive 
models. The best model was selected based on its accuracy and area under the 
receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC), followed by fine-grained 
hyperparameter adjustment using the Bayesian Optimization Algorithm. A compact 
model was developed, based on 15 features selected according to their importance 
and clinical availability. These two models were compared with Logistic 
Regression and SIC scores in terms of SIC prediction. Results: Of 11,362 
patients in MIMIC-IV included in the final cohort, a total of 6,744 (59%) 
patients developed SIC during sepsis. The model named Categorical Boosting 
(CatBoost) had the greatest AUC in our study (0.869; 95% CI: 0.850-0.886). 
Coagulation profile and renal function indicators were the most important 
features for predicting SIC. A compact model was developed with an AUC of 0.854 
(95% CI: 0.832-0.872), while the AUCs of Logistic Regression and SIC scores were 
0.746 (95% CI: 0.735-0.755) and 0.709 (95% CI: 0.687-0.733), respectively. A 
cohort of 35,252 septic patients in eICU-CRD was analyzed. The AUCs of the full 
and the compact models in the external validation were 0.842 (95% CI: 
0.837-0.846) and 0.803 (95% CI: 0.798-0.809), respectively, which were still 
larger than those of Logistic Regression (0.660; 95% CI: 0.653-0.667) and SIC 
scores (0.752; 95% CI: 0.747-0.757). Prediction results were illustrated by 
SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) values, which made our models clinically 
interpretable. Conclusions: We developed two models which were able to 
dynamically predict the risk of SIC in septic patients better than conventional 
Logistic Regression and SIC scores.

BACKGROUND: A survival prediction model based on deep learning has higher 
accuracy than the CPH model in predicting the survival of CCU patients, and it 
also has a better discrimination ability. We collected information on patients 
with various diseases in coronary care units (CCUs) from the Medical Information 
Mart for Intensive Care III (MIMIC-III) database. The purpose of this study was 
to use this information to construct a neural-network model based on deep 
learning to predict the survival probabilities of patients with conditions that 
are common in CCUs.
METHOD: We collected information on patients in the United States with five 
common diseases in CCUs from 2001 to 2012. We randomly divided the patients into 
a training cohort and a testing cohort at a ratio of 7 : 3 and applied a 
survival prediction method based on deep learning to predict their survival 
probability. We compared our model with the Cox proportional-hazards regression 
(CPH) model and used the concordance indexes (C-indexes), receiver operating 
characteristic (ROC) curve, and calibration plots to evaluate the predictive 
performance of the model.
RESULTS: The 3,388 CCU patients included in the study were randomly divided into 
2,371 in the training cohort and 1,017 in the testing cohort. The stepwise 
regression results showed that the important factors affecting patient survival 
were the type of disease, age, race, anion gap, glucose, neutrophils, white 
blood cells, potassium, creatine kinase, and blood urea nitrogen (P < 0.05). We 
used the training cohort to construct a deep-learning model, for which the 
C-index was 0.833, or about 5% higher than that for the CPH model (0.786). The 
C-index of the deep-learning model for the test cohort was 0.822, which was also 
higher than that for the CPH model (0.782). The areas under the ROC curve for 
the 28-day, 90-day, and 1-year survival probabilities were 0.875, 0.865, and 
0.874, respectively, in the deep-learning model, respectively, and 0.830, 0.843, 
and 0.806 in the CPH model. These values indicate that the survival analysis 
model based on deep learning is better than the traditional CPH model in 
predicting the survival of CCU patients.
CONCLUSION: A survival prediction model based on deep learning has higher 
accuracy than the CPH model in predicting the survival of CCU patients, and it 
also has a better discrimination ability.

Background: Acute kidney injury (AKI) is a prevalent and serious complication 
among patients with sepsis-associated acute respiratory distress syndrome 
(ARDS). Prompt and accurate prediction of AKI has an important role in timely 
intervention, ultimately improving the patients' survival rate. This study aimed 
to establish machine learning models to predict AKI via thorough analysis of 
data derived from electronic medical records. Method: The data of eligible 
patients were retrospectively collected from the Medical Information Mart for 
Intensive Care III database from 2001 to 2012. The primary outcome was the 
development of AKI within 48 hours after intensive care unit admission. Four 
different machine learning models were established based on logistic regression, 
support vector machine, random forest, and extreme gradient boosting (XGBoost). 
The performance of all predictive models was evaluated using the area under 
receiver operating characteristic curve, precision-recall curve, confusion 
matrix, and calibration plot. Moreover, the discrimination ability of the 
machine learning models was compared with that of the Sequential Organ Failure 
Assessment (SOFA) model. Results; Among 1,085 sepsis-associated ARDS patients 
included in this research, 375 patients (34.6%) developed AKI within 48 hours 
after intensive care unit admission. Twelve predictive variables were selected 
and further used to establish the machine learning models. The XGBoost model 
yielded the most accurate predictions with the highest area under receiver 
operating characteristic curve (0.86) and accuracy (0.81). In addition, a novel 
shiny application based on the XGBoost model was established to predict the 
probability of developing AKI among patients with sepsis-associated ARDS. 
Conclusions: Machine learning models could be used for predicting AKI in 
patients with sepsis-associated ARDS. Accordingly, a user-friendly shiny 
application based on the XGBoost model with reliable predictive performance was 
released online to predict the probability of developing AKI among patients with 
sepsis-associated ARDS.

BACKGROUND: Cardiac arrest (CA) is one of the leading causes of death among 
patients in the intensive care unit (ICU). Although many CA prediction models 
with high sensitivity have been developed to anticipate CA, their practical 
application has been challenging due to a lack of generalization and validation. 
Additionally, the heterogeneity among patients in different ICU subtypes has not 
been adequately addressed.
OBJECTIVE: This study aims to propose a clinically interpretable ensemble 
approach for the timely and accurate prediction of CA within 24 hours, 
regardless of patient heterogeneity, including variations across different 
populations and ICU subtypes. Additionally, we conducted patient-independent 
evaluations to emphasize the model's generalization performance and analyzed 
interpretable results that can be readily adopted by clinicians in real-time.
METHODS: Patients were retrospectively analyzed using data from the Medical 
Information Mart for Intensive Care-IV (MIMIC-IV) and the eICU-Collaborative 
Research Database (eICU-CRD). To address the problem of underperformance, we 
constructed our framework using feature sets based on vital signs, 
multiresolution statistical analysis, and the Gini index, with a 12-hour window 
to capture the unique characteristics of CA. We extracted 3 types of features 
from each database to compare the performance of CA prediction between high-risk 
patient groups from MIMIC-IV and patients without CA from eICU-CRD. After 
feature extraction, we developed a tabular network (TabNet) model using feature 
screening with cost-sensitive learning. To assess real-time CA prediction 
performance, we used 10-fold leave-one-patient-out cross-validation and a 
cross-data set method. We evaluated MIMIC-IV and eICU-CRD across different 
cohort populations and subtypes of ICU within each database. Finally, external 
validation using the eICU-CRD and MIMIC-IV databases was conducted to assess the 
model's generalization ability. The decision mask of the proposed method was 
used to capture the interpretability of the model.
RESULTS: The proposed method outperformed conventional approaches across 
different cohort populations in both MIMIC-IV and eICU-CRD. Additionally, it 
achieved higher accuracy than baseline models for various ICU subtypes within 
both databases. The interpretable prediction results can enhance clinicians' 
understanding of CA prediction by serving as a statistical comparison between 
non-CA and CA groups. Next, we tested the eICU-CRD and MIMIC-IV data sets using 
models trained on MIMIC-IV and eICU-CRD, respectively, to evaluate 
generalization ability. The results demonstrated superior performance compared 
with baseline models.
CONCLUSIONS: Our novel framework for learning unique features provides stable 
predictive power across different ICU environments. Most of the interpretable 
global information reveals statistical differences between CA and non-CA groups, 
demonstrating its utility as an indicator for clinical decisions. Consequently, 
the proposed CA prediction system is a clinically validated algorithm that 
enables clinicians to intervene early based on CA prediction information and can 
be applied to clinical trials in digital health.

BACKGROUND: The stress hyperglycemia ratio (SHR) was developed to reduce the 
effects of long-term chronic glycemic factors on stress hyperglycemia levels, 
which was associated with adverse clinical outcomes. This study aims to evaluate 
the relationship between the postoperative SHR index and all-cause mortality in 
patients undergoing cardiac surgery.
METHODS: Data for this study were extracted from the Medical Information Mart 
for Intensive Care IV (MIMIC-IV) database. Patients were categorized into four 
groups based on postoperative SHR index quartiles. The primary outcome was 
30-day all-cause mortality, while the secondary outcomes included in-hospital, 
90-day and 360-day all-cause mortality. The SHR index was analyzed using 
quartiles, and Kaplan-Meier curves were generated to compare outcomes across 
groups. Cox proportional hazards regression and restricted cubic splines (RCS) 
were employed to assess the relationship between the SHR index and the outcomes. 
LASSO regression was used for feature selection. Six machine learning algorithms 
were used to predict in-hospital all-cause mortality and were further extended 
to predict 360-day all-cause mortality. The SHapley Additive exPlanations method 
was used for visualizing model characteristics and individual case predictions.
RESULTS: A total of 3,848 participants were included in the study, with a mean 
age of 68 ± 12 years and female participants comprised 30.6% (1,179). Higher 
postoperative SHR index levels were associated with an increased risk of 
in-hospital, 90-day and 360-day all-cause mortality as shown by Kaplan-Meier 
curves (log-rank P < 0.05). Cox regression analysis revealed that the highest 
postoperative SHR quartile was associated with a significantly higher risk of 
mortality at these time points (P < 0.05). RCS analysis demonstrated nonlinear 
relationships between the postoperative SHR index and all-cause mortality (P for 
nonlinear < 0.05). The Naive Bayes model achieves the highest area under the 
curve (AUC) for predicting both in-hospital mortality (0.7936) and 360-day 
all-cause mortality (0.7410).
CONCLUSION: In patients undergoing cardiac surgery, higher postoperative SHR 
index levels were significantly associated with increased risk of in-hospital, 
90-day and 360-day all-cause mortality. The SHR index may serve as a valid tool 
for assessing the severity after cardiac surgery and guiding treatment 
decisions.

BACKGROUND: Acute kidney injury (AKI) is a serve and harmful syndrome in the 
intensive care unit. Comparing to the patients with AKI stage 1/2, the patients 
with AKI stage 3 have higher in-hospital mortality and risk of progression to 
chronic kidney disease. The purpose of this study is to develop a prediction 
model that predict whether patients with AKI stage 1/2 will progress to AKI 
stage 3.
METHODS: Patients with AKI stage 1/2, when they were first diagnosed with AKI in 
the Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care, were included. We used the 
Logistic regression and machine learning extreme gradient boosting (XGBoost) to 
build two models which can predict patients who will progress to AKI stage 3. 
Established models were evaluated by cross-validation, receiver operating 
characteristic curve, and precision-recall curves.
RESULTS: We included 25,711 patients, of whom 2130 (8.3%) progressed to AKI 
stage 3. Creatinine, multiple organ failure syndromes were the most important in 
AKI progression prediction. The XGBoost model has a better performance than the 
Logistic regression model on predicting AKI stage 3 progression. Thus, we build 
a software based on our data which can predict AKI progression in real time.
CONCLUSIONS: The XGboost model can better identify patients with AKI progression 
than Logistic regression model. Machine learning techniques may improve 
predictive modeling in medical research.

BACKGROUND: Acute kidney injury (AKI), a prevalent non-neurological complication 
following traumatic brain injury (TBI), is a major clinical issue with an 
unfavorable prognosis. This study aimed to develop and validate machine learning 
models to predict severe AKI (stage 3 or greater) incidence in patients with 
TBI.
METHODS: A retrospective cohort study was conducted by using two public 
databases: the Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care IV (MIMIC)-IV and the 
eICU Collaborative Research Database (eICU-CRD). Recursive feature elimination 
was used to select candidate predictors obtained within 24 h of intensive care 
unit admission. The area under the curve and decision curve analysis curves were 
used to determine the discriminatory ability. On the other hand, the calibration 
curve was employed to evaluate the calibrated performance of the newly developed 
machine learning models.
RESULTS: In the MIMIC-IV database, there were 808 patients diagnosed with 
moderate and severe TBI (msTBI) (msTBI is defined as Glasgow Coma Score < 12). 
Of these, 60 (7.43%) patients experienced severe AKI. External validation in the 
eICU-CRD indicated that the random forest (RF) model had the highest area under 
the curve of 0.819 (95% confidence interval 0.783-0.851). Furthermore, in the 
calibration curve, the RF model was well calibrated (P = 0.795).
CONCLUSIONS: In this study, the RF model demonstrated better discrimination in 
predicting severe AKI than other models. An online calculator could facilitate 
its application, potentially improving the early detection of severe AKI and 
subsequently improving the clinical outcomes among patients with msTBI.

Acute myocardial infarction (AMI) and sepsis are the leading causes of high 
mortality rates in intensive care units. While sepsis frequently affects the 
cardiovascular system, distinguishing between sepsis-induced cardiomyopathy and 
AMI remains challenging due to overlapping biomarkers. Misdiagnosis can hinder 
timely treatment and increase risk of complications. This study used 
multidimensional clinical data and machine learning techniques to develop and 
validate a novel predictive model for identifying AMI in critically ill patients 
with sepsis. Data from patients with sepsis were extracted from the Medical 
Information Mart for Intensive Care-IV database. Six machine learning algorithms 
were employed for model construction. Additionally, the machine learning-based 
models were compared with traditional scoring systems. Model performance was 
evaluated in terms of discrimination, calibration, and clinical applicability. 
In total, 2,103 critically ill patients with sepsis were included, 459 (21.8%) 
of whom experienced AMI during hospitalization. A total of 26 variables were 
selected for model construction. Among all models, the Gradient Boosting 
Classifier model demonstrated the best predictive performance in terms of 
discrimination, calibration, and clinical applicability. Machine learning models 
have the potential to serve as tools for predicting AMI in patients with sepsis. 
The Gradient Boosting Classifier model developed herein demonstrated promising 
predictive performance, supporting clinicians in identifying patients at 
high-risk of sepsis and implementing early interventions to reduce mortality 
rates.

BACKGROUND: Sepsis is a leading cause of morbidity and mortality in hospitalized 
patients. Up to now, there are no well-established longitudinal networks from 
molecular mechanisms to clinical phenotypes in sepsis. Adding to the problem, 
about one of the five patients presented with diabetes. For this subgroup, 
management is difficult, and prognosis is difficult to evaluate.
METHODS: From the three databases, a total of 7,001 patients were enrolled on 
the basis of sepsis-3 standard and diabetes diagnosis. Input variable selection 
is based on the result of correlation analysis in a handpicking way, and 53 
variables were left. A total of 5,727 records were collected from Medical 
Information Mart for Intensive Care database and randomly split into a training 
set and an internal validation set at a ratio of 7:3. Then, logistic regression 
with lasso regularization, Bayes logistic regression, decision tree, random 
forest, and XGBoost were conducted to build the predictive model by using 
training set. Then, the models were tested by the internal validation set. The 
data from eICU Collaborative Research Database (n = 815) and dtChina critical 
care database (n = 459) were used to test the model performance as the external 
validation set.
RESULTS: In the internal validation set, the accuracy values of logistic 
regression with lasso regularization, Bayes logistic regression, decision tree, 
random forest, and XGBoost were 0.878, 0.883, 0.865, 0.883, and 0.882, 
respectively. Likewise, in the external validation set 1, lasso regularization = 
0.879, Bayes logistic regression = 0.877, decision tree = 0.865, random forest = 
0.886, and XGBoost = 0.875. In the external validation set 2, lasso 
regularization = 0.715, Bayes logistic regression = 0.745, decision tree = 
0.763, random forest = 0.760, and XGBoost = 0.699.
CONCLUSION: The top three models for internal validation set were Bayes logistic 
regression, random forest, and XGBoost, whereas the top three models for 
external validation set 1 were random forest, logistic regression, and Bayes 
logistic regression. In addition, the top three models for the external 
validation set 2 were decision tree, random forest, and Bayes logistic 
regression. Random forest model performed well with the training and three 
validation sets. The most important features are age, albumin, and lactate.

BACKGROUND: Hospital-acquired pressure injuries (HAPIs) have a major impact on 
patient outcomes in intensive care units (ICUs). Effective prevention relies on 
early and accurate risk assessment. Traditional risk-assessment tools, such as 
the Braden Scale, often fail to capture ICU-specific factors, limiting their 
predictive accuracy. Although artificial intelligence models offer improved 
accuracy, their "black box" nature poses a barrier to clinical adoption.
OBJECTIVE: To develop an artificial intelligence-based HAPI risk-assessment 
model enhanced with an explainable artificial intelligence dashboard to improve 
interpretability at both the global and individual patient levels.
METHODS: An explainable artificial intelligence approach was used to analyze ICU 
patient data from the Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care. Predictor 
variables were restricted to the first 48 hours after ICU admission. Various 
machine-learning algorithms were evaluated, culminating in an ensemble "super 
learner" model. The model's performance was quantified using the area under the 
receiver operating characteristic curve through 5-fold cross-validation. An 
explainer dashboard was developed (using synthetic data for patient privacy), 
featuring interactive visualizations for in-depth model interpretation at the 
global and local levels.
RESULTS: The final sample comprised 28 395 patients with a 4.9% incidence of 
HAPIs. The ensemble super learner model performed well (area under curve = 
0.80). The explainer dashboard provided global and patient-level interactive 
visualizations of model predictions, showing each variable's influence on the 
risk-assessment outcome.
CONCLUSION: The model and its dashboard provide clinicians with a transparent, 
interpretable artificial intelligence-based risk-assessment system for HAPIs 
that may enable more effective and timely preventive interventions.

IMPORTANCE: The efficient and accurate interpretation of radiologic images is 
paramount.
OBJECTIVE: To evaluate whether a deep learning-based artificial intelligence 
(AI) engine used concurrently can improve reader performance and efficiency in 
interpreting chest radiograph abnormalities.
DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: This multicenter cohort study was conducted 
from April to November 2021 and involved radiologists, including attending 
radiologists, thoracic radiology fellows, and residents, who independently 
participated in 2 observer performance test sessions. The sessions included a 
reading session with AI and a session without AI, in a randomized crossover 
manner with a 4-week washout period in between. The AI produced a heat map and 
the image-level probability of the presence of the referrable lesion. The data 
used were collected at 2 quaternary academic hospitals in Boston, Massachusetts: 
Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center (The Medical Information Mart for Intensive 
Care Chest X-Ray [MIMIC-CXR]) and Massachusetts General Hospital (MGH).
MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: The ground truths for the labels were created via 
consensual reading by 2 thoracic radiologists. Each reader documented their 
findings in a customized report template, in which the 4 target chest radiograph 
findings and the reader confidence of the presence of each finding was recorded. 
The time taken for reporting each chest radiograph was also recorded. 
Sensitivity, specificity, and area under the receiver operating characteristic 
curve (AUROC) were calculated for each target finding.
RESULTS: A total of 6 radiologists (2 attending radiologists, 2 thoracic 
radiology fellows, and 2 residents) participated in the study. The study 
involved a total of 497 frontal chest radiographs-247 from the MIMIC-CXR data 
set (demographic data for patients were not available) and 250 chest radiographs 
from MGH (mean [SD] age, 63 [16] years; 133 men [53.2%])-from adult patients 
with and without 4 target findings (pneumonia, nodule, pneumothorax, and pleural 
effusion). The target findings were found in 351 of 497 chest radiographs. The 
AI was associated with higher sensitivity for all findings compared with the 
readers (nodule, 0.816 [95% CI, 0.732-0.882] vs 0.567 [95% CI, 0.524-0.611]; 
pneumonia, 0.887 [95% CI, 0.834-0.928] vs 0.673 [95% CI, 0.632-0.714]; pleural 
effusion, 0.872 [95% CI, 0.808-0.921] vs 0.889 [95% CI, 0.862-0.917]; 
pneumothorax, 0.988 [95% CI, 0.932-1.000] vs 0.792 [95% CI, 0.756-0.827]). 
AI-aided interpretation was associated with significantly improved reader 
sensitivities for all target findings, without negative impacts on the 
specificity. Overall, the AUROCs of readers improved for all 4 target findings, 
with significant improvements in detection of pneumothorax and nodule. The 
reporting time with AI was 10% lower than without AI (40.8 vs 36.9 seconds; 
difference, 3.9 seconds; 95% CI, 2.9-5.2 seconds; P < .001).
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: These findings suggest that AI-aided interpretation 
was associated with improved reader performance and efficiency for identifying 
major thoracic findings on a chest radiograph.

INTRODUCTION: This study aimed to develop and validate an interpretable 
machine-learning model based on clinical features for early predicting 
in-hospital mortality in critically ill patients with sepsis.
METHODS: We enrolled all patients with sepsis in the Medical Information Mart 
for Intensive Care IV (MIMIC-IV, v.1.0) database from 2008 to 2019. Lasso 
regression was used for feature selection. Seven machine-learning methods were 
applied to develop the models. The best model was selected based on its accuracy 
and area under curve (AUC) in the validation cohort. Furthermore, we employed 
the SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) method to illustrate the effects of the 
features attributed to the model, and to analyze how the individual features 
affect the output of the model, and to visualize the Shapley value for a single 
individual.
RESULTS: In total, 8,817 patients with sepsis were eligible for participation, 
the median age was 66.8 years (IQR, 55.9-77.1 years), and 3361 of 8817 
participants (38.1%) were women. After selection, 25 of a total 57 clinical 
parameters collected on day 1 after ICU admission remained associated with 
prognosis and were used for developing the machine-learning models. Among seven 
constructed models, the eXtreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost) model achieved the 
best performance with an AUC of 0.884 and an accuracy of 89.5% in the validation 
cohort. Feature importance analysis showed that Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) score, 
blood urea nitrogen, respiratory rate, urine output, and age were the top 5 
features of the XGBoost model with the greatest impact. Furthermore, SHAP force 
analysis illustrated how the constructed model visualized the individualized 
prediction of death.
CONCLUSIONS: We have demonstrated the potential of machine-learning approaches 
for predicting outcome early in patients with sepsis. The SHAP method could 
improve the interpretability of machine-learning models and help clinicians 
better understand the reasoning behind the outcome.

Background: Mechanically ventilated patients in the intensive care unit (ICU) 
have high mortality rates. There are multiple prediction scores, such as the 
Simplified Acute Physiology Score II (SAPS II), Oxford Acute Severity of Illness 
Score (OASIS), and Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (SOFA), widely used in 
the general ICU population. We aimed to establish prediction scores on 
mechanically ventilated patients with the combination of these disease severity 
scores and other features available on the first day of admission. Methods: A 
retrospective administrative database study from the Medical Information Mart 
for Intensive Care (MIMIC-III) database was conducted. The exposures of interest 
consisted of the demographics, pre-ICU comorbidity, ICU diagnosis, disease 
severity scores, vital signs, and laboratory test results on the first day of 
ICU admission. Hospital mortality was used as the outcome. We used the machine 
learning methods of k-nearest neighbors (KNN), logistic regression, bagging, 
decision tree, random forest, Extreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost), and neural 
network for model establishment. A sample of 70% of the cohort was used for the 
training set; the remaining 30% was applied for testing. Areas under the 
receiver operating characteristic curves (AUCs) and calibration plots would be 
constructed for the evaluation and comparison of the models' performance. The 
significance of the risk factors was identified through models and the top 
factors were reported. Results: A total of 28,530 subjects were enrolled through 
the screening of the MIMIC-III database. After data preprocessing, 25,659 adult 
patients with 66 predictors were included in the model analyses. With the 
training set, the models of KNN, logistic regression, decision tree, random 
forest, neural network, bagging, and XGBoost were established and the testing 
set obtained AUCs of 0.806, 0.818, 0.743, 0.819, 0.780, 0.803, and 0.821, 
respectively. The calibration curves of all the models, except for the neural 
network, performed well. The XGBoost model performed best among the seven 
models. The top five predictors were age, respiratory dysfunction, SAPS II 
score, maximum hemoglobin, and minimum lactate. Conclusion: The current study 
indicates that models with the risk of factors on the first day could be 
successfully established for predicting mortality in ventilated patients. The 
XGBoost model performs best among the seven machine learning models.

BACKGROUND: Staphylococcus aureus bacteremia (SAB) remains a significant 
contributor to both community-acquired and healthcare-associated bloodstream 
infections. SAB exhibits a high recurrence rate and mortality rate, leading to 
numerous clinical treatment challenges. Particularly, since the outbreak of 
COVID-19, there has been a gradual increase in SAB patients, with a growing 
proportion of (Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus) MRSA infections. 
Therefore, we have constructed and validated a pediction model for recurrent SAB 
using machine learning. This model aids physicians in promptly assessing the 
condition and intervening proactively.
METHODS: The patients data is sourced from the Medical Information Mart for 
Intensive Care IV (MIMIC-IV) database version 2.2. The patients were divided 
into training and testing datasets using a 7:3 random sampling ratio. The 
process of feature selection employed two methods: Recursive Feature Elimination 
(RFE) and Least Absolute Shrinkage and Selection Operator (LASSO). Prediction 
models were built using Extreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost), Random Forest (RF), 
Logistic Regression (LR), Support Vector Machine (SVM), and Artificial Neural 
Network (ANN). Model validation included Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) 
analysis, Decision Curve Analysis (DCA), and Precision-Recall Curve (PRC). We 
utilized SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations) values to demonstrate the 
significance of each feature and explain the XGBoost model.
RESULTS: After screening, MRSA, PTT, RBC, RDW, Neutrophils_abs, Sodium, Calcium, 
Vancomycin concentration, MCHC, MCV, and Prognostic Nutritional Index(PNI) were 
selected as features for constructing the model. Through combined evaluation 
using ROC、 DCA and PRC, XGBoost demonstrated the best predictive performance, 
achieving an AUC value of 0.76 (95% CI: 0.66-0.85) in ROC and 0.56 (95% CI: 
0.37-0.75) in PRC. Building a website based on the Xgboost model. SHAP 
illustrated the feature importance ranking in the XGBoost model and provided 
examples to explain the XGBoost model.
CONCLUSIONS: The adoption of XGBoost for model development holds widespread 
acceptance in the medical domain. The prediction model for recurrent SAB, 
developed by our team, aids physicians in timely diagnosis and treatment of 
patients.

BACKGROUND: Sepsis is one of the most life-threatening circumstances for 
critically ill patients in the United States, while diagnosis of sepsis is 
challenging as a standardized criteria for sepsis identification is still under 
development. Disparities in social determinants of sepsis patients can interfere 
with the risk prediction performances using machine learning.
METHODS: We analyzed a cohort of critical care patients from the Medical 
Information Mart for Intensive Care (MIMIC)-III database. Disparities in social 
determinants, including race, sex, marital status, insurance types and 
languages, among patients identified by six available sepsis criteria were 
revealed by forest plots with 95% confidence intervals. Sepsis patients were 
then identified by the Sepsis-3 criteria. Sixteen machine learning classifiers 
were trained to predict in-hospital mortality for sepsis patients on a training 
set constructed by random selection. The performance was measured by area under 
the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC). The performance of the 
trained model was tested on the entire randomly conducted test set and each 
sub-population built based on each of the following social determinants: race, 
sex, marital status, insurance type, and language. The fluctuations in 
performances were further examined by permutation tests.
RESULTS: We analyzed a total of 11,791 critical care patients from the MIMIC-III 
database. Within the population identified by each sepsis identification method, 
significant differences were observed among sub-populations regarding race, 
marital status, insurance type, and language. On the 5783 sepsis patients 
identified by the Sepsis-3 criteria statistically significant performance 
decreases for mortality prediction were observed when applying the trained 
machine learning model on Asian and Hispanic patients, as well as the 
Spanish-speaking patients. With pairwise comparison, we detected performance 
discrepancies in mortality prediction between Asian and White patients, Asians 
and patients of other races, as well as English-speaking and Spanish-speaking 
patients.
CONCLUSIONS: Disparities in proportions of patients identified by various sepsis 
criteria were detected among the different social determinant groups. The 
performances of mortality prediction for sepsis patients can be compromised when 
applying a universally trained model for each subpopulation. To achieve accurate 
diagnosis, a versatile diagnostic system for sepsis is needed to overcome the 
social determinant disparities of patients.

DeepCNAP: A Deep Learning Approach for Continuous Noninvasive Arterial Blood 
Pressure Monitoring Using Photoplethysmography.

Kim DK, Kim YT, Kim H, Kim DJ.

Arterial blood pressure (ABP) monitoring may permit the early diagnosis and 
management of cardiovascular disease (CVD); however, existing methods for 
measuring ABP outside the clinic use inconvenient cuff sphygmomanometry, or do 
not estimate continuous ABP waveforms. This study proposes a novel deep learning 
model DeepCNAP for estimating continuous BP waveform from a noninvasively 
measured photoplethysmography (PPG) signal in real-time. DeepCNAP was designed 
through the combination of deep convolutional networks and self-attention. The 
proposed method was constructed via 10-fold cross-validation based on the MIMIC 
database (the number of subjects = 942, recording time = 374.43 hours). The 
performance of DeepCNAP was evaluated from two perspectives: estimating ABP from 
PPG and classifying hemodynamically unstable events (i.e., hypertension, 
prehypertension, hypotension, and the normal state). The mean absolute errors of 
the BP estimates were 3.40 ± 4.36 mmHg for systolic BP, 1.75 ± 2.25 mmHg for 
diastolic BP, and 3.23 ± 2.21 mmHg for the BP waveform, indicating that DeepCNAP 
satisfies the standards of both the British Hypertension Society (BHS) and the 
Association for the Advancement of Medical Instrumentation (AAMI). From the 
estimated BP, hypertension, prehypertension, hypotension, and the normal state 
were classified with 99.44, 97.58, 92.23, and 94.64% accuracy, respectively. 
DeepCNAP enables feasible real-time estimation of invasively measured ABP from 
noninvasive PPG. With its noninvasive nature, high accuracy, and clinical 
relevance, the proposed model could be valuable in general wards at hospitals 
and for wearable devices in daily life.

OBJECTIVE: We aimed to develop and validate a predictive machine learning (ML) 
model for cardiac surgery associated with acute kidney injury (CSA-AKI) based on 
a multicenter randomized control trial (RCT) and a Medical Information Mart for 
Intensive Care-IV (MIMIC-IV) dataset.
METHODS: This was a subanalysis from a completed RCT approved by the Ethics 
Committee of Fuwai Hospital in Beijing, China (NCT03782350). Data from Fuwai 
Hospital were randomly assigned, with 80% for the training dataset and 20% for 
the testing dataset. The data from three other centers were used for the 
external validation dataset. Furthermore, the MIMIC-IV dataset was also utilized 
to validate the performance of the predictive model. The area under the receiver 
operating characteristic curve (ROC-AUC), the precision-recall curve (PR-AUC), 
and the calibration brier score were applied to evaluate the performance of the 
traditional logistic regression (LR) and eleven ML algorithms. Additionally, the 
Shapley Additive Explanations (SHAP) interpreter was used to explain the 
potential risk factors for CSA-AKI.
RESULT: A total of 6495 eligible patients undergoing cardiopulmonary bypass 
(CPB) were eventually included in this study, 2416 of whom were from Fuwai 
Hospital (Beijing), for model development, 562 from three other cardiac centers 
in China, and 3517 from the MIMICIV dataset, were used, respectively, for 
external validation. The CatBoostClassifier algorithms outperformed other 
models, with excellent discrimination and calibration performance for the 
development, as well as the MIMIC-IV, datasets. In addition, the 
CatBoostClassifier achieved ROC-AUCs of 0.85, 0.67, and 0.77 and brier scores of 
0.14, 0.19, and 0.16 in the testing, external, and MIMIC-IV datasets, 
respectively. Moreover, the utmost important risk factor, the N-terminal brain 
sodium peptide (NT-proBNP), was confirmed by the LASSO method in the feature 
section process. Notably, the SHAP explainer identified that the preoperative 
blood urea nitrogen level, prothrombin time, serum creatinine level, total 
bilirubin level, and age were positively correlated with CSA-AKI; preoperative 
platelets level, systolic and diastolic blood pressure, albumin level, and body 
weight were negatively associated with CSA-AKI.
CONCLUSIONS: The CatBoostClassifier algorithms outperformed other ML models in 
the discrimination and calibration of CSA-AKI prediction cardiac surgery with 
CPB, based on a multicenter RCT and MIMIC-IV dataset. Moreover, the preoperative 
NT-proBNP level was confirmed to be strongly related to CSA-AKI.

BACKGROUND: Patients' encounters with healthcare services must undergo clinical 
coding. These codes are typically derived from free-text notes. Manual clinical 
coding is expensive, time-consuming and prone to error. Automated clinical 
coding systems have great potential to save resources, and realtime availability 
of codes would improve oversight of patient care and accelerate research. 
Automated coding is made challenging by the idiosyncrasies of clinical text, the 
large number of disease codes and their unbalanced distribution.
METHODS: We explore methods for representing clinical text and the labels in 
hierarchical clinical coding ontologies. Text is represented as term 
frequency-inverse document frequency counts and then as word embeddings, which 
we use as input to recurrent neural networks. Labels are represented atomically, 
and then by learning representations of each node in a coding ontology and 
composing a representation for each label from its respective node path. We 
consider different strategies for initialisation of the node representations. We 
evaluate our methods using the publicly-available Medical Information Mart for 
Intensive Care III dataset: we extract the history of presenting illness section 
from each discharge summary in the dataset, then predicting the International 
Classification of Diseases, ninth revision, Clinical Modification codes 
associated with these.
RESULTS: Composing the label representations from the clinical-coding-ontology 
nodes increased weighted F1 for prediction of the 17,561 disease labels to 
0.264-0.281 from 0.232-0.249 for atomic representations. Recurrent neural 
network text representation improved weighted F1 for prediction of the 19 
disease-category labels to 0.682-0.701 from 0.662-0.682 using term 
frequency-inverse document frequency. However, term frequency-inverse document 
frequency outperformed recurrent neural networks for prediction of the 17,561 
disease labels.
CONCLUSIONS: This study demonstrates that hierarchically-structured medical 
knowledge can be incorporated into statistical models, and produces improved 
performance during automated clinical coding. This performance improvement 
results primarily from improved representation of rarer diseases. We also show 
that recurrent neural networks improve representation of medical text in some 
settings. Learning good representations of the very rare diseases in clinical 
coding ontologies from data alone remains challenging, and alternative means of 
representing these diseases will form a major focus of future work on automated 
clinical coding.

OBJECTIVE: Our study aimed to identify predictors as well as develop machine 
learning (ML) models to predict the risk of 30-day mortality in patients with 
sepsis-associated encephalopathy (SAE).
MATERIALS AND METHODS: ML models were developed and validated based on a public 
database named Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care (MIMIC)-IV. Models 
were compared by the area under the curve (AUC), accuracy, sensitivity, 
specificity, positive and negative predictive values, and Hosmer-Lemeshow good 
of fit test.
RESULTS: Of 6994 patients in MIMIC-IV included in the final cohort, a total of 
1232 (17.62%) patients died following SAE. Recursive feature elimination (RFE) 
selected 15 variables, including acute physiology score III (APSIII), Glasgow 
coma score (GCS), sepsis related organ failure assessment (SOFA), Charlson 
comorbidity index (CCI), red blood cell volume distribution width (RDW), blood 
urea nitrogen (BUN), age, respiratory rate, PaO2, temperature, lactate, 
creatinine (CRE), malignant cancer, metastatic solid tumor, and platelet (PLT). 
The validation cohort demonstrated all ML approaches had higher discriminative 
ability compared with the bagged trees (BT) model, although the difference was 
not statistically significant. Furthermore, in terms of the calibration 
performance, the artificial neural network (NNET), logistic regression (LR), and 
adapting boosting (Ada) models had a good calibration-namely, a high accuracy of 
prediction, with P-values of 0.831, 0.119, and 0.129, respectively.
CONCLUSIONS: The ML models, as demonstrated by our study, can be used to 
evaluate the prognosis of SAE patients in the intensive care unit (ICU). Online 
calculator could facilitate the sharing of predictive models.

BACKGROUND: Electronic Health Records (EHRs) aggregate diverse information at 
the patient level, holding a trajectory representative of the evolution of the 
patient health status throughout time. Although this information provides 
context and can be leveraged by physicians to monitor patient health and make 
more accurate prognoses/diagnoses, patient records can contain information from 
very long time spans, which combined with the rapid generation rate of medical 
data makes clinical decision making more complex. Patient trajectory modelling 
can assist by exploring existing information in a scalable manner, and can 
contribute in augmenting health care quality by fostering preventive medicine 
practices (e.g. earlier disease diagnosis).
METHODS: We propose a solution to model patient trajectories that combines 
different types of information (e.g. clinical text, standard codes) and 
considers the temporal aspect of clinical data. This solution leverages two 
different architectures: one supporting flexible sets of input features, to 
convert patient admissions into dense representations; and a second exploring 
extracted admission representations in a recurrent-based architecture, where 
patient trajectories are processed in sub-sequences using a sliding window 
mechanism.
RESULTS: The developed solution was evaluated on two different clinical 
outcomes, unexpected patient readmission and disease progression, using the 
publicly available Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care (MIMIC)-III 
clinical database. The results obtained demonstrate the potential of the first 
architecture to model readmission and diagnoses prediction using single patient 
admissions. While information from clinical text did not show the discriminative 
power observed in other existing works, this may be explained by the need to 
fine-tune the clinicalBERT model. Finally, we demonstrate the potential of the 
sequence-based architecture using a sliding window mechanism to represent the 
input data, attaining comparable performances to other existing solutions.
CONCLUSION: Herein, we explored DL-based techniques to model patient 
trajectories and propose two flexible architectures that explore patient 
admissions on an individual and sequence basis. The combination of clinical text 
with other types of information led to positive results, which can be further 
improved by including a fine-tuned version of clinicalBERT in the architectures.

BACKGROUND: Sepsis-associated acute kidney injury (S-AKI) is considered to be 
associated with high morbidity and mortality, a commonly accepted model to 
predict mortality is urged consequently. This study used a machine learning 
model to identify vital variables associated with mortality in S-AKI patients in 
the hospital and predict the risk of death in the hospital. We hope that this 
model can help identify high-risk patients early and reasonably allocate medical 
resources in the intensive care unit (ICU).
METHODS: A total of 16,154 S-AKI patients from the Medical Information Mart for 
Intensive Care IV database were examined as the training set (80%) and the 
validation set (20%). Variables (129 in total) were collected, including basic 
patient information, diagnosis, clinical data, and medication records. We 
developed and validated machine learning models using 11 different algorithms 
and selected the one that performed the best. Afterward, recursive feature 
elimination was used to select key variables. Different indicators were used to 
compare the prediction performance of each model. The SHapley Additive 
exPlanations package was applied to interpret the best machine learning model in 
a web tool for clinicians to use. Finally, we collected clinical data of S-AKI 
patients from two hospitals for external validation.
RESULTS: In this study, 15 critical variables were finally selected, namely, 
urine output, maximum blood urea nitrogen, rate of injection of norepinephrine, 
maximum anion gap, maximum creatinine, maximum red blood cell volume 
distribution width, minimum international normalized ratio, maximum heart rate, 
maximum temperature, maximum respiratory rate, minimum fraction of inspired O2, 
minimum creatinine, minimum Glasgow Coma Scale, and diagnosis of diabetes and 
stroke. The categorical boosting algorithm model presented significantly better 
predictive performance [receiver operating characteristic (ROC): 0.83] than 
other models [accuracy (ACC): 75%, Youden index: 50%, sensitivity: 75%, 
specificity: 75%, F1 score: 0.56, positive predictive value (PPV): 44%, and 
negative predictive value (NPV): 92%]. External validation data from two 
hospitals in China were also well validated (ROC: 0.75).
CONCLUSIONS: After selecting 15 crucial variables, a machine learning-based 
model for predicting the mortality of S-AKI patients was successfully 
established and the CatBoost model demonstrated best predictive performance.

Sepsis-associated acute kidney injury (S-AKI) is very common and early 
prediction is beneficial. This study aiming to develop an accurate ensemble 
model to predict the risk of S-AKI based on easily available clinical 
information. Patients with sepsis from the United States (US) database Medical 
Information Mart for Intensive Care-IV were used as a modeling cohort to predict 
the occurrence of AKI by combining Support Vector Machine, Random Forest, Neural 
Network, and Extreme Gradient Boost as four first-level learners via stacking 
algorithm. The external validation databases were the eICU Collaborative 
Research Database from US and Critical Care Database comprising infection 
patients at Zigong Fourth People's Hospital from China, whose AUROC values for 
the ensemble model 48-12 h before the onset of AKI were 0.774-0.788 and 
0.756-0.813, respectively. In this study, an ensemble model for early prediction 
of S-AKI onset was developed and it demonstrated good performance in multicenter 
external datasets.

BACKGROUND: Lactic acidosis is a heterogeneous condition with multiple 
underlying causes and associated outcomes. The use of multi-dimensional patient 
data to subtype lactic acidosis can personalize patient care. Machine learning 
consensus clustering may identify lactic acidosis subgroups with unique clinical 
profiles and outcomes.
METHODS: We used the Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care III database to 
abstract electronic medical record data from patients admitted to intensive care 
units (ICU) in a tertiary care hospital in the United States. We included 
patients who developed lactic acidosis (defined as serum lactate ≥ 4 mmol/L) 
within 48 h of ICU admission. We performed consensus clustering analysis based 
on patient characteristics, comorbidities, vital signs, organ supports, and 
laboratory data to identify clinically distinct lactic acidosis subgroups. We 
calculated standardized mean differences to show key subgroup features. We 
compared outcomes among subgroups.
RESULTS: We identified 1919 patients with lactic acidosis. The algorithm 
revealed three best unique lactic acidosis subgroups based on patient variables. 
Cluster 1 (n = 554) was characterized by old age, elective admission to cardiac 
surgery ICU, vasopressor use, mechanical ventilation use, and higher pH and 
serum bicarbonate. Cluster 2 (n = 815) was characterized by young age, admission 
to trauma/surgical ICU with higher blood pressure, lower comorbidity burden, 
lower severity index, and less vasopressor use. Cluster 3 (n = 550) was 
characterized by admission to medical ICU, history of liver disease and 
coagulopathy, acute kidney injury, lower blood pressure, higher comorbidity 
burden, higher severity index, higher serum lactate, and lower pH and serum 
bicarbonate. Cluster 3 had the worst outcomes, while cluster 1 had the most 
favorable outcomes in terms of persistent lactic acidosis and mortality.
CONCLUSIONS: Consensus clustering analysis synthesized the pattern of clinical 
and laboratory data to reveal clinically distinct lactic acidosis subgroups with 
different outcomes.

BACKGROUND: The growing population of elderly neurocritically ill patients 
highlights the need for effective prognosis prediction tools. This study aims to 
develop and validate machine learning (ML) models for predicting 28-day 
mortality in intensive care units (ICUs).
METHODS: Data were extracted from the Medical Information Mart for Intensive 
Care IV(MIMIC-IV) database, focusing on elderly neurocritical ill patients with 
ICU stays ≥ 24 h. The cohort was split into 70 % for training and 30 % for 
internal validation. We analyzed 58 variables, including demographics, vital 
signs, medications, lab results, comorbidities, and medical scores, using Lasso 
regression to identify predictors of 28-day mortality. Seven ML algorithms were 
evaluated, and the best model was validated with data from Guizhou Medical 
University Affiliated Hospital. A log-rank test was used to assess survival 
differences in Kaplan-Meier curves. Shapley Additive Explanations (SHAP) were 
used to interpret the best model, while subgroup analysis identified variations 
in model performance across different populations.
RESULTS: The study included 1,773 elderly neurocritically ill patients, with a 
28-day mortality rate of 28.6 %. The Light Gradient Boosting Machine (LightGBM) 
outperformed other models, achieving an area under the curve (AUC) of 0.896 in 
internal validation and 0.812 in external validation. Kaplan-Meier analysis 
showed that higher LightGBM prediction scores correlated with lower survival 
probabilities. Key predictors identified through SHAP analysis included partial 
pressure of arterial carbon dioxide (PaCO2), Acute physiology and chronic health 
evaluation II (APACHE II), white blood cell count, age, and lactate. The 
LightGBM model demonstrated consistent performance across various subgroups.
CONCLUSIONS: The LightGBM model effectively predicts 28-day mortality risk in 
elderly neurocritically ill patients, aiding clinicians in management and 
resource allocation. Its reliable performance across diverse subgroups 
underscores its clinical utility.

This paper targets a major challenge of how to effectively allocate medical 
resources in intensive care units (ICUs). We trained multiple regression models 
using the Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care III (MIMIC III) database 
recorded in the period between 2001 and 2012. The training and validation 
dataset included pneumonia, sepsis, congestive heart failure, hypotension, chest 
pain, coronary artery disease, fever, respiratory failure, acute coronary 
syndrome, shortness of breath, seizure and transient ischemic attack, and aortic 
stenosis patients' recorded data. Then we tested the models on the unseen data 
of patients diagnosed with coronary artery disease, congestive heart failure or 
acute coronary syndrome. We included the admission characteristics, clinical 
prescriptions, physiological measurements, and discharge characteristics of 
those patients. We assessed the models' performance using mean residuals and 
running times as metrics. We ran multiple experiments to study the data 
partition's impact on the learning phase. The total running time of our 
best-evaluated model is 123,450.9 mS. The best model gives an average accuracy 
of 98%, highlighting the location of discharge, initial diagnosis, location of 
admission, drug therapy, length of stay and internal transfers as the most 
influencing patterns to decide a patient's readiness for discharge.

INTRODUCTION: This study aims to construct a mortality prediction model for 
patients with non-variceal upper gastrointestinal bleeding (NVUGIB) in the 
intensive care unit (ICU), employing advanced machine learning algorithms. The 
goal is to identify high-risk populations early, contributing to a deeper 
understanding of patients with NVUGIB in the ICU.
METHODS: We extracted NVUGIB data from the Medical Information Mart for 
Intensive Care IV (MIMIC-IV, v.2.2) database spanning from 2008 to 2019. Feature 
selection was conducted through LASSO regression, followed by training models 
using 11 machine learning methods. The best model was chosen based on the area 
under the curve (AUC). Subsequently, Shapley additive explanations (SHAP) was 
employed to elucidate how each factor influenced the model. Finally, a case was 
randomly selected, and the model was utilized to predict its mortality, 
demonstrating the practical application of the developed model.
RESULTS: In total, 2716 patients with NVUGIB were deemed eligible for 
participation. Following selection, 30 out of a total of 64 clinical parameters 
collected on day 1 after ICU admission remained associated with prognosis and 
were utilized for developing machine learning models. Among the 11 constructed 
models, the Gradient Boosting Decision Tree (GBDT) model demonstrated the best 
performance, achieving an AUC of 0.853 and an accuracy of 0.839 in the 
validation cohort. Feature importance analysis highlighted that shock, Glasgow 
Coma Scale (GCS), renal disease, age, albumin, and alanine aminotransferase 
(ALP) were the top six features of the GBDT model with the most significant 
impact. Furthermore, SHAP force analysis illustrated how the constructed model 
visualized the individualized prediction of death.
CONCLUSIONS: Patient data from the MIMIC database were leveraged to develop a 
robust prognostic model for patients with NVUGIB in the ICU. The analysis using 
SHAP also assisted clinicians in gaining a deeper understanding of the disease.

Blood pressure is a basic physiological parameter in the cardiovascular 
circulatory system. Long-term abnormal blood pressure will lead to various 
cardiovascular diseases, making the early detection and assessment of 
hypertension profoundly significant for the prevention and treatment of 
cardiovascular diseases. In this paper, we investigate whether or not deep 
learning can provide better results for hypertension risk stratification when 
compared to the classical signal processing and feature extraction methods. We 
tested a deep learning method for the classification and evaluation of 
hypertension using photoplethysmography (PPG) signals based on the continuous 
wavelet transform (using Morse) and pretrained convolutional neural network 
(using GoogLeNet). We collected 121 data recordings from the Multiparameter 
Intelligent Monitoring in Intensive Care (MIMIC) Database, each containing 
arterial blood pressure (ABP) and photoplethysmography (PPG) signals. The ABP 
signals were utilized to extract blood pressure category labels, and the PPG 
signals were used to train and test the model. According to the seventh report 
of the Joint National Committee, blood pressure levels are categorized as 
normotension (NT), prehypertension (PHT), and hypertension (HT). For the early 
diagnosis and assessment of HT, the timely detection of PHT and the accurate 
diagnosis of HT are significant. Therefore, three HT classification trials were 
set: NT vs. PHT, NT vs. HT, and (NT + PHT) vs. HT. The F-scores of these three 
classification trials were 80.52%, 92.55%, and 82.95%, respectively. The tested 
deep method achieved higher accuracy for hypertension risk stratification when 
compared to the classical signal processing and feature extraction method. 
Additionally, the method achieved comparable results to another approach that 
requires electrocardiogram and PPG signals.

BACKGROUND: This study aimed to develop and validate an interpretable 
machine-learning model that utilizes clinical features and inflammatory 
biomarkers to predict the risk of in-hospital mortality in critically ill 
patients suffering from sepsis.
METHODS: We enrolled all patients diagnosed with sepsis in the Medical 
Information Mart for Intensive Care IV (MIMIC-IV, v.2.0), eICU Collaborative 
Research Care (eICU-CRD 2.0), and the Amsterdam University Medical Centers 
databases (AmsterdamUMCdb 1.0.2). LASSO regression was employed for feature 
selection. Seven machine-learning methods were applied to develop prognostic 
models. The optimal model was chosen based on its accuracy, F1 score and area 
under curve (AUC) in the validation cohort. Moreover, we utilized the SHapley 
Additive exPlanations (SHAP) method to elucidate the effects of the features 
attributed to the model and analyze how individual features affect the model's 
output. Finally, Spearman correlation analysis examined the associations among 
continuous predictor variables. Restricted cubic splines (RCS) explored 
potential non-linear relationships between continuous risk factors and 
in-hospital mortality.
RESULTS: 3535 patients with sepsis were eligible for participation in this 
study. The median age of the participants was 66 years (IQR, 55-77 years), and 
56% were male. After selection, 12 of the 45 clinical parameters collected on 
the first day after ICU admission remained associated with prognosis and were 
used to develop machine-learning models. Among seven constructed models, the 
eXtreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost) model achieved the best performance, with an 
AUC of 0.94 and an F1 score of 0.937 in the validation cohort. Feature 
importance analysis revealed that Age, AST, invasive ventilation treatment, and 
serum urea nitrogen (BUN) were the top four features of the XGBoost model with 
the most significant impact. Inflammatory biomarkers may have prognostic value. 
Furthermore, SHAP force analysis illustrated how the constructed model 
visualized the prediction of the model.
CONCLUSIONS: This study demonstrated the potential of machine-learning 
approaches for early prediction of outcomes in patients with sepsis. The SHAP 
method could improve the interoperability of machine-learning models and help 
clinicians better understand the reasoning behind the outcome.

BACKGROUND: Lactic acidosis is the most common cause of anion gap metabolic 
acidosis in the intensive care unit (ICU), associated with poor outcomes 
including mortality. We sought to compare machine learning (ML) approaches 
versus logistic regression analysis for prediction of mortality in lactic 
acidosis patients admitted to the ICU.
METHODS: We used the Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care (MIMIC-III) 
database to identify ICU adult patients with lactic acidosis (serum lactate ≥4 
mmol/L). The outcome of interest was hospital mortality. We developed prediction 
models using four ML approaches consisting of random forest (RF), decision tree 
(DT), extreme gradient boosting (XGBoost), artificial neural network (ANN), and 
statistical modeling with forward stepwise logistic regression using the testing 
dataset. We then assessed model performance using area under the receiver 
operating characteristic curve (AUROC), accuracy, precision, error rate, 
Matthews correlation coefficient (MCC), F1 score, and assessed model calibration 
using the Brier score, in the independent testing dataset.
RESULTS: Of 1919 lactic acidosis ICU patients, 1535 and 384 were included in the 
training and testing dataset, respectively. Hospital mortality was 30%. RF had 
the highest AUROC at 0.83, followed by logistic regression 0.81, XGBoost 0.81, 
ANN 0.79, and DT 0.71. In addition, RF also had the highest accuracy (0.79), MCC 
(0.45), F1 score (0.56), and lowest error rate (21.4%). The RF model was the 
most well-calibrated. The Brier score for RF, DT, XGBoost, ANN, and 
multivariable logistic regression was 0.15, 0.19, 0.18, 0.19, and 0.16, 
respectively. The RF model outperformed multivariable logistic regression model, 
SOFA score (AUROC 0.74), SAP II score (AUROC 0.77), and Charlson score (AUROC 
0.69).
CONCLUSION: The ML prediction model using RF algorithm provided the highest 
predictive performance for hospital mortality among ICU patient with lactic 
acidosis.

INTRODUCTION: Sepsis is a leading cause of death. However, there is a lack of 
useful model to predict outcome in sepsis. Herein, the aim of this study was to 
develop an explainable machine learning (ML) model for predicting 28-day 
mortality in patients with sepsis based on Sepsis 3.0 criteria.
METHODS: We obtained the data from the Medical Information Mart for Intensive 
Care (MIMIC)-III database (version 1.4). The overall data was randomly assigned 
to the training and testing sets at a ratio of 3:1. Following the application of 
LASSO regression analysis to identify the modeling variables, we proceeded to 
develop models using Extreme Gradient Boost (XGBoost), Logistic Regression (LR), 
Support Vector Machine (SVM), and Random Forest (RF) techniques with 5-fold 
cross-validation. The optimal model was selected based on its area under the 
curve (AUC). Finally, the Shapley additive explanations (SHAP) method was used 
to interpret the optimal model.
RESULTS: A total of 5,834 septic adults were enrolled, the median age was 
66 years (IQR, 54-78 years) and 2,342 (40.1%) were women. After feature 
selection, 14 variables were included for developing model in the training set. 
The XGBoost model (AUC: 0.806) showed superior performance with AUC, compared 
with RF (AUC: 0.794), LR (AUC: 0.782) and SVM model (AUC: 0.687). SHAP summary 
analysis for XGBoost model showed that urine output on day 1, age, blood urea 
nitrogen and body mass index were the top four contributors. SHAP dependence 
analysis demonstrated insightful nonlinear interactive associations between 
factors and outcome. SHAP force analysis provided three samples for model 
prediction.
CONCLUSION: In conclusion, our study successfully demonstrated the efficacy of 
ML models in predicting 28-day mortality in sepsis patients, while highlighting 
the potential of the SHAP method to enhance model transparency and aid in 
clinical decision-making.

BACKGROUND: Hepatic encephalopathy (HE) is associated with marked increases in 
morbidity and mortality for cirrhosis patients. This study aimed to develop and 
validate machine learning (ML) models to predict 28-day mortality for patients 
with HE.
METHODS: A retrospective cohort study was conducted in the Medical Information 
Mart for Intensive Care (MIMIC)-IV database. Patients from MIMIC-IV were 
randomized into training and validation cohorts in a ratio of 7:3. Training 
cohort was used for establishing the model while validation cohort was used for 
validation. The outcome was defined as 28-day mortality. Predictors were 
identified by recursive feature elimination (RFE) within 24 h of intensive care 
unit (ICU) admission. The area under the curve (AUC) and calibration curve were 
used to determine the predictive performance of different ML models.
RESULTS: In the MIMIC-IV database, 601 patients were eventually diagnosed with 
HE. Of these, 112 (18.64%) experienced death within 28 days. Acute physiology 
score III (APSIII), sepsis related organ failure assessment (SOFA), 
international normalized ratio (INR), total bilirubin (TBIL), albumin, blood 
urea nitrogen (BUN), acute kidney injury (AKI) and mechanical ventilation were 
identified as independent risk factors. Validation set indicated that the 
artificial neural network (NNET) model had the highest AUC of 0.837 (95% 
CI:0.774-0.901). Furthermore, in the calibration curve, the NNET model was also 
well-calibrated (P = 0.323), which means that it can better predict the 28-day 
mortality in HE patients. Additionally, the performance of the NNET is superior 
to existing scores, including Model for End-Stage Liver Disease (MELD) and Model 
for End-Stage Liver Disease-Sodium (MELD-Na).
CONCLUSIONS: In this study, the NNET model demonstrated better discrimination in 
predicting 28-day mortality as compared to other models. This developed model 
could potentially improve the early detection of HE with high mortality, 
subsequently improving clinical outcomes in these patients with HE, but further 
external prospective validation is still required.

BACKGROUND: The prediction of successful weaning from mechanical ventilation 
(MV) in advance of intubation can facilitate discussions regarding end-of-life 
care before unnecessary intubation.
OBJECTIVE: We aimed to develop a machine learning-based model that predicts 
successful weaning from ventilator support based on routine clinical and 
laboratory data taken before or immediately after intubation.
METHODS: We used the Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care IV database, 
which is an open-access database covering 524,740 admissions of 382,278 patients 
in Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center, United States, from 2008 to 2019. We 
selected adult patients who underwent MV in the intensive care unit (ICU). 
Clinical and laboratory variables that are considered relevant to the prognosis 
of the patient in the ICU were selected. Data collected before or within 24 
hours of intubation were used to develop machine learning models that predict 
the probability of successful weaning within 14 days of ventilator support. 
Developed models were integrated into an ensemble model. Performance metrics 
were calculated by 5-fold cross-validation for each model, and a permutation 
feature importance and Shapley additive explanations analysis was conducted to 
better understand the impacts of individual variables on outcome prediction.
RESULTS: Of the 23,242 patients, 19,025 (81.9%) patients were successfully 
weaned from MV within 14 days. Using the preselected 46 clinical and laboratory 
variables, the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve of 
CatBoost classifier, random forest classifier, and regularized logistic 
regression classifier models were 0.860 (95% CI 0.852-0.868), 0.855 (95% CI 
0.848-0.863), and 0.823 (95% CI 0.813-0.832), respectively. Using the ensemble 
voting classifier using the 3 models above, the final model revealed the area 
under the receiver operating characteristic curve of 0.861 (95% CI 0.853-0.869), 
which was significantly better than that of Simplified Acute Physiology Score II 
(0.749, 95% CI 0.742-0.756) and Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (0.588, 95% 
CI 0.566-0.609). The top features included lactate and anion gap. The model's 
performance achieved a plateau with approximately the top 21 variables.
CONCLUSIONS: We developed machine learning algorithms that can predict 
successful weaning from MV in advance to intubation in the ICU. Our models can 
aid the appropriate management for patients who hesitate to decide on ventilator 
support or meaningless end-of-life care.

INTRODUCTION: Acute kidney injury (AKI) is common among hospitalized patients 
and has a significant impact on morbidity and mortality. Although early 
prediction of AKI has the potential to reduce adverse patient outcomes, it 
remains a difficult condition to predict and diagnose. The purpose of this study 
was to evaluate the ability of a machine learning algorithm to predict for AKI 
as defined by Kidney Disease: Improving Global Outcomes (KDIGO) stage 2 or 3 up 
to 48 hours in advance of onset using convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and 
patient electronic health record (EHR) data.
METHODS: A CNN prediction system was developed to use EHR data gathered during 
patients' stays to predict AKI up to 48 hours before onset. A total of 12,347 
patient encounters were retrospectively analyzed from the Medical Information 
Mart for Intensive Care III (MIMIC-III) database. An XGBoost AKI prediction 
model and the sequential organ failure assessment (SOFA) scoring system were 
used as comparators. The outcome was AKI onset. The model was trained on 
routinely collected patient EHR data. Measurements included area under the 
receiver operating characteristic (AUROC) curve, positive predictive value 
(PPV), and a battery of additional performance metrics for advance prediction of 
AKI onset.
RESULTS: On a hold-out test set, the algorithm attained an AUROC of 0.86 and PPV 
of 0.24, relative to a cohort AKI prevalence of 7.62%, for long-horizon AKI 
prediction at a 48-hour window before onset.
CONCLUSION: A CNN machine learning-based AKI prediction model outperforms 
XGBoost and the SOFA scoring system, revealing superior performance in 
predicting AKI 48 hours before onset, without reliance on serum creatinine (SCr) 
measurements.

BACKGROUND: Research on patients with cerebral infarction in the Intensive Care 
Unit (ICU) is still lacking. Our study aims to develop and validate multiple 
machine-learning (ML) models using two large ICU databases-Medical Information 
Mart for Intensive Care version III (MIMIC-III) and eICU Research Institute 
Database (eRI)-to guide clinical practice.
METHODS: We collected clinical data from patients with cerebral infarction in 
the MIMIC-III and eRI databases within 24 h of admission. The opinion of 
neurologists and the Least Absolute Shrinkage and Selection Operator regression 
was used to screen for relevant clinical features. Using eRI as the training set 
and MIMIC-III as the test set, we developed and validated six ML models. Based 
on the results of the model validation, we select the best model and perform the 
interpretability analysis on it.
RESULTS: A total of 4,338 patients were included in the study (eRI:3002, 
MIMIC-III:1336), resulting in a total of 18 clinical characteristics through 
screening. Model validation results showed that random forest (RF) was the best 
model, with AUC and F1 scores of 0.799 and 0.417 in internal validation and 
0.733 and 0.498 in external validation, respectively; moreover, its sensitivity 
and recall were the highest of the six algorithms for both the internal and 
external validation. The explanatory analysis of the model showed that the three 
most important variables in the RF model were Acute Physiology Score-III, 
Glasgow Coma Scale score, and heart rate, and that the influence of each 
variable on the judgement of the model was consistent with medical knowledge.
CONCLUSION: Based on a large sample of patients and advanced algorithms, our 
study bridges the limitations of studies on this area. With our model, 
physicians can use the admission information of cerebral infarction patients in 
the ICU to identify high-risk groups among them who are prone to in-hospital 
death, so that they could be more alert to this group of patients and upgrade 
medical measures early to minimize the mortality of patients.

OBJECTIVES: Prolonged intubation (PI) is a frequently encountered severe 
complication among patients following cardiac surgery (CS). Solely concentrating 
on preoperative data, devoid of sufficient consideration for the ongoing impact 
of surgical, anesthetic, and cardiopulmonary bypass procedures on subsequent 
respiratory system function, could potentially compromise the predictive 
accuracy of disease prognosis. In response to this challenge, we formulated and 
externally validated an intelligible prediction model tailored for CS patients, 
leveraging both preoperative information and early intensive care unit (ICU) 
data to facilitate early prophylaxis for PI.
METHODS: We conducted a retrospective cohort study, analyzing adult patients who 
underwent CS and utilizing data from two publicly available ICU databases, 
namely, the Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care and the eICU 
Collaborative Research Database. PI was defined as necessitating intubation for 
over 24 h. The predictive model was constructed using multivariable logistic 
regression. External validation of the model's predictive performance was 
conducted, and the findings were elucidated through visualization techniques.
RESULTS: The incidence rates of PI in the training, testing, and external 
validation cohorts were 11.8%, 12.1%, and 17.5%, respectively. We identified 11 
predictive factors associated with PI following CS: plateau pressure [odds ratio 
(OR), 1.133; 95% confidence interval (CI), 1.111-1.157], lactate level (OR, 
1.131; 95% CI, 1.067-1.2), Charlson Comorbidity Index (OR, 1.166; 95% CI, 
1.115-1.219), Sequential Organ Failure Assessment score (OR, 1.096; 95% CI, 
1.061-1.132), central venous pressure (OR, 1.052; 95% CI, 1.033-1.073), anion 
gap (OR, 1.075; 95% CI, 1.043-1.107), positive end-expiratory pressure (OR, 
1.087; 95% CI, 1.047-1.129), vasopressor usage (OR, 1.521; 95% CI, 1.23-1.879), 
Visual Analog Scale score (OR, 0.928; 95% CI, 0.893-0.964), pH value (OR, 0.757; 
95% CI, 0.629-0.913), and blood urea nitrogen level (OR, 1.011; 95% CI, 
1.003-1.02). The model exhibited an area under the receiver operating 
characteristic curve (AUROC) of 0.853 (95% CI, 0.840-0.865) in the training 
cohort, 0.867 (95% CI, 0.853-0.882) in the testing cohort, and 0.704 (95% CI, 
0.679-0.727) in the external validation cohort.
CONCLUSIONS: Through multicenter internal and external validation, our model, 
which integrates early ICU data and preoperative information, exhibited 
outstanding discriminative capability. This integration allows for the accurate 
assessment of PI risk in the initial phases following CS, facilitating timely 
interventions to mitigate adverse outcomes.

BACKGROUND: Currently, very few preventive or therapeutic strategies are used 
for mechanical ventilation (MV)-associated severe acute kidney injury (AKI).
OBJECTIVES: We developed clinical prediction models to detect the onset of 
severe AKI in the first week of intensive care unit (ICU) stay during the 
initiation of MV.
METHODS: A large ICU database Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care IV 
(MIMIC-IV) was analysed retrospectively. Data were collected from the clinical 
information recorded at the time of ICU admission and during the initial 12 h of 
MV. Using univariate and multivariate analyses, the predictors were selected 
successively. For model development, two machine learning algorithms were 
compared. The primary goal was to predict the development of AKI stage 2 or 3 
(AKI-23) and AKI stage 3 (AKI-3) in the first week of patients' ICU stay after 
initial 12 h of MV. The developed models were externally validated using another 
multicentre ICU database (eICU Collaborative Research Database, eICU) and 
evaluated in various patient subpopulations.
RESULTS: Models were developed using data from the development cohort (MIMIC-IV: 
2008-2016; n = 3986); the random forest algorithm outperformed the logistic 
regression algorithm. In the internal (MIMIC-IV: 2017-2019; n = 1210) and 
external (eICU; n = 1494) validation cohorts, the incidences of AKI-23 were 154 
(12.7%) and 119 (8.0%), respectively, with areas under the receiver operator 
characteristic curve of 0.78 (95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.74-0.82) and 0.80 
(95% CI: 0.76-0.84); the incidences of AKI-3 were 81 (6.7%) and 67 (4.5%), with 
areas under the receiver operator characteristic curve of 0.81 (95% CI: 
0.76-0.87) and 0.80 (95% CI: 0.73-0.86), respectively.
CONCLUSIONS: Models driven by machine learning and based on routine clinical 
data may facilitate the early prediction of MV-associated severe AKI. The 
validated models can be found at: https://apoet.shinyapps.io/mv_aki_2021_v2/.

INTRODUCTION: The emergence of more complex Prolonged Field Care in austere 
settings and the need to assist inexperienced providers' ability to treat 
patients create an urgent need for effective tools to support care. We report on 
a project to develop a phone-/tablet-based decision support system for 
prehospital tactical combat casualty care that collects physiologic and other 
clinical data and uses machine learning to detect and differentiate shock 
manifestation.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: Software interface development methods included 
literature review, rapid prototyping, and subject matter expert design 
requirements reviews. Machine learning algorithm methods included development of 
a model trained on publicly available Medical Information Mart for Intensive 
Care data, then on de-identified data from Mayo Clinic Intensive Care Unit.
RESULTS: The project team interviewed 17 Army, Air Force, and Navy medical 
subject matter experts during design requirements review sessions. They had an 
average of 17 years of service in military medicine and an average of 4 
deployments apiece and all had performed tactical combat casualty care on live 
patients during deployment. Comments provided requirements for shock 
identification and management in prehospital settings, including support for 
indication of shock probability and shock differentiation. The machine learning 
algorithm based on logistic regression performed best among other algorithms we 
tested and was able to predict shock onset 90 minutes before it occurred with 
better than 75% accuracy in the test dataset.
CONCLUSIONS: We expect the Trauma Triage, Treatment, and Training Decision 
Support system will augment a medic's ability to make informed decisions based 
on salient patient data and to diagnose multiple types of shock through remotely 
trained, field deployed ML models.

STUDY DESIGN: A retrospective cohort study.
OBJECTIVE: The objective of the study was to develop machine-learning (ML) 
classifiers for predicting prolonged intensive care unit (ICU)-stay and 
prolonged hospital-stay for critical patients with spinal cord injury (SCI).
SUMMARY OF BACKGROUND DATA: Critical patients with SCI in ICU need more 
attention. SCI patients with prolonged stay in ICU usually occupy vast medical 
resources and hinder the rehabilitation deployment.
METHODS: A total of 1599 critical patients with SCI were included in the study 
and labeled with prolonged stay or normal stay. All data were extracted from the 
eICU Collaborative Research Database and the Medical Information Mart for 
Intensive Care III-IV Database. The extracted data were randomly divided into 
training, validation and testing (6:2:2) subdatasets. A total of 91 initial ML 
classifiers were developed, and the top three initial classifiers with the best 
performance were further stacked into an ensemble classifier with logistic 
regressor. The area under the curve (AUC) was the main indicator to assess the 
prediction performance of all classifiers. The primary predicting outcome was 
prolonged ICU-stay, while the secondary predicting outcome was prolonged 
hospital-stay.
RESULTS: In predicting prolonged ICU-stay, the AUC of the ensemble classifier 
was 0.864 ± 0.021 in the three-time five-fold cross-validation and 0.802 in the 
independent testing. In predicting prolonged hospital-stay, the AUC of the 
ensemble classifier was 0.815 ± 0.037 in the three-time five-fold 
cross-validation and 0.799 in the independent testing. Decision curve analysis 
showed the merits of the ensemble classifiers, as the curves of the top three 
initial classifiers varied a lot in either predicting prolonged ICU-stay or 
discriminating prolonged hospital-stay.
CONCLUSION: The ensemble classifiers successfully predict the prolonged ICU-stay 
and the prolonged hospital-stay, which showed a high potential of assisting 
physicians in managing SCI patients in ICU and make full use of medical 
resources.Level of Evidence: 3.

Modern Intensive Care Units (ICUs) provide continuous monitoring of critically 
ill patients susceptible to many complications affecting morbidity and 
mortality. ICU settings require a high staff-to-patient ratio and generates a 
sheer volume of data. For clinicians, the real-time interpretation of data and 
decision-making is a challenging task. Machine Learning (ML) techniques in ICUs 
are making headway in the early detection of high-risk events due to increased 
processing power and freely available datasets such as the Medical Information 
Mart for Intensive Care (MIMIC). We conducted a systematic literature review to 
evaluate the effectiveness of applying ML in the ICU settings using the MIMIC 
dataset. A total of 322 articles were reviewed and a quantitative descriptive 
analysis was performed on 61 qualified articles that applied ML techniques in 
ICU settings using MIMIC data. We assembled the qualified articles to provide 
insights into the areas of application, clinical variables used, and treatment 
outcomes that can pave the way for further adoption of this promising technology 
and possible use in routine clinical decision-making. The lessons learned from 
our review can provide guidance to researchers on application of ML techniques 
to increase their rate of adoption in healthcare.

OBJECTIVE: Gastrointestinal (GI) bleeding commonly requires intensive care unit 
(ICU) in cases of potentialhaemodynamiccompromise or likely urgent intervention. 
However, manypatientsadmitted to the ICU stop bleeding and do not require 
further intervention, including blood transfusion. The present work proposes an 
artificial intelligence (AI) solution for the prediction of rebleeding in 
patients with GI bleeding admitted to ICU.
METHODS: A machine learning algorithm was trained and tested using two publicly 
available ICU databases, the Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care V.1.4 
database and eICU Collaborative Research Database using freedom from transfusion 
as a proxy for patients who potentially did not require ICU-level care. Multiple 
initial observation time frames were explored using readily available data 
including labs, demographics and clinical parameters for a total of 20 
covariates.
RESULTS: The optimal model used a 5-hour observation period to achieve an area 
under the curve of the receiving operating curve (ROC-AUC) of greater than 0.80. 
The model was robust when tested against both ICU databases with a similar 
ROC-AUC for all.
CONCLUSIONS: The potential disruptive impact of AI in healthcare innovation is 
acknowledge, but awareness of AI-related risk on healthcare applications and 
current limitations should be considered before implementation and deployment. 
The proposed algorithm is not meant to replace but to inform clinical decision 
making. Prospective clinical trial validation as a triage tool is warranted.

PURPOSE: Rhabdomyolysis (RM) is a complex set of clinical syndromes that 
involves the rapid dissolution of skeletal muscles. Mortality from RM is 
approximately 10%. This study aimed to develop an interpretable and 
generalizable model for early mortality prediction in RM patients.
METHOD: Retrospective analyses were performed on two electronic medical record 
databases: the eICU Collaborative Research Database and the Medical Information 
Mart for Intensive Care III database. We extracted data from the first 24 h 
after patient ICU admission. Data from the two data sets were merged for further 
analysis. The merged data sets were randomly divided, with 70% used for training 
and 30% for validation. We used the machine learning model extreme gradient 
boosting (XGBoost) with the Shapley additive explanation method to conduct early 
and interpretable predictions of patient mortality. Five typical evaluation 
indexes were adopted to develop a generalizable model.
RESULTS: In total, 938 patients with RM were eligible for this analysis. The 
area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) of the XGBoost 
model in predicting hospital mortality was 0.871, the sensitivity was 0.885, the 
specificity was 0.816, the accuracy was 0.915, and the F1 score was 0.624. The 
XGBoost model performance was superior to that of other models (logistic 
regression, AUC = 0.862; support vector machine, AUC = 0.843; random forest, AUC 
= 0.825; and naive Bayesian, AUC = 0.805) and clinical scores (Sequential Organ 
Failure Assessment, AUC = 0.747; Acute Physiology Score III, AUC = 0.721).
CONCLUSIONS: Although the XGBoost model is still not great from an absolute 
performance perspective, it provides better predictive performance than other 
models for estimating the mortality of patients with RM based on patient 
characteristics in the first 24 h of admission to the ICU.

The demand for emergency department (ED) services is increasing across the 
globe, particularly during the current COVID-19 pandemic. Clinical triage and 
risk assessment have become increasingly challenging due to the shortage of 
medical resources and the strain on hospital infrastructure caused by the 
pandemic. As a result of the widespread use of electronic health records (EHRs), 
we now have access to a vast amount of clinical data, which allows us to develop 
prediction models and decision support systems to address these challenges. To 
date, there is no widely accepted clinical prediction benchmark related to the 
ED based on large-scale public EHRs. An open-source benchmark data platform 
would streamline research workflows by eliminating cumbersome data 
preprocessing, and facilitate comparisons among different studies and 
methodologies. Based on the Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care IV 
Emergency Department (MIMIC-IV-ED) database, we created a benchmark dataset and 
proposed three clinical prediction benchmarks. This study provides future 
researchers with insights, suggestions, and protocols for managing data and 
developing predictive tools for emergency care.

OBJECTIVE: With the aging of populations and the high prevalence of stroke, 
postoperative stroke has become a growing concern. This study aimed to establish 
a prediction model and assess the risk factors for stroke in elderly patients 
during the postoperative period.
METHODS: ML (Machine learning) prediction models were applied to elderly 
patients from the MIMIC (Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care)-III and 
MIMIC-VI databases. The SMOTENC (synthetic minority oversampling technique for 
nominal and continuous data) balancing technique and iterative SVD (Singular 
Value Decomposition) data imputation method were used to address the problem of 
category imbalance and missing values, respectively. We analyzed the possible 
predictive factors of stroke in elderly patients using seven modeling approaches 
to train the model. The diagnostic value of the model derived from machine 
learning was evaluated by the ROC curve (receiver operating characteristic 
curve).
RESULTS: We analyzed 7,128 and 661 patients from MIMIC-VI and MIMIC-III, 
respectively. The XGB (extreme gradient boosting) model got the highest AUC 
(area under the curve) of 0.78 (0.75-0.81), making it better than the other six 
models, Besides, we found that XGB model with databalancing was better than that 
without data balancing. Based on this prediction model, we found hypertension, 
cancer, congestive heart failure, chronic pulmonary disease and peripheral 
vascular disease were the top five predictors. Furthermore, we demonstrated that 
hypertension predicted postoperative stroke is much more valuable.
CONCLUSION: Stroke in elderly patients during the postoperative period can be 
reliably predicted. We proved XGB model is a reliable predictive model, and the 
history of hypertension should be weighted more heavily than the results of 
laboratory tests to prevent postoperative stroke in elderly patients regardless 
of gender.

BACKGROUND: Current prediction models are suboptimal for determining mortality 
risk in patients with acute pancreatitis (AP); this might be improved by using a 
machine learning (ML) model. In this study, we aimed to construct an explainable 
ML model to calculate the risk of mortality in patients with AP admitted in 
intensive care unit (ICU) and compared it with existing scoring systems.
METHODS: A gradient-boosting ML (XGBoost) model was developed and externally 
validated based on two public databases: Medical Information Mart for Intensive 
Care (MIMIC, training cohort) and the eICU Collaborative Research Database 
(eICU-CRD, validation cohort). We compared the performance of the XGBoost model 
with validated clinical risk scoring systems (the APACHE IV, SOFA, and Bedside 
Index for Severity in Acute Pancreatitis [BISAP]) by area under receiver 
operating characteristic curve (AUC) analysis. SHAP (SHapley Additive 
exPlanations) method was applied to provide the explanation behind the 
prediction outcome.
RESULTS: The XGBoost model performed better than the clinical scoring systems in 
correctly predicting mortality risk of AP patients, achieving an AUC of 0.89 
(95% CI: 0.84-0.94). When set the sensitivity at 100% for death prediction, the 
model had a specificity of 38%, much higher than the APACHE IV, SOFA and BISAP 
score, which had a specificity of 1%, 16% and 1% respectively.
CONCLUSIONS: This model might increase identification of very low-risk patients 
who can be safely monitored in a general ward for management. By making the 
model explainable, physicians would be able to better understand the reasoning 
behind the prediction.

BACKGROUND: Reduced left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) initiates heart 
failure, and promptly identifying low ejection fraction is crucial for managing 
progression and averting mortality. In this study we developed an artificial 
intelligence-enabled electrocardiogram (AI-ECG) algorithm to identify patients 
with low ejection fraction and predict LVEF values.
METHODS: The electrocardiogram data were used as input, and the algorithm 
generated the probability of the patient suffering a low ejection fraction and 
estimated the LVEF value. A 5-year follow-up study on a group of individuals who 
initially had normal LVEF values was also performed. Furthermore, external 
validation of the algorithm performance was conducted using the Medical 
Information Mart for Intensive Care-IV database.
RESULTS: The algorithm's performance on the test set yielded an area under the 
curve value of 0.965 for detecting LVEF ≤ 50%. The algorithm had an accuracy of 
92.8%, sensitivity of 88.8%, and specificity of 92.9%. For LVEF regression, the 
method showed a mean absolute error of 5.28 (95% confidence interval, 5.23-5.33) 
for the testing set. Additionally, the algorithm obtained an area under the 
curve value of 0.848 and a mean absolute error value of 9.56 during external 
validation. Patients with false positive results had a significantly greater 
likelihood of developing a low ejection fraction compared with patients who 
received true negative results (26.2% vs 2.0%; P < 0.0001).
CONCLUSIONS: The AI-ECG algorithm is capable of identifying low ejection 
fraction in patients with high accuracy. The AI-ECG algorithm is an efficient, 
prompt, and cost-effective screening tool for early heart failure.

BACKGROUND: Although current guidelines didn't support the routine use of 
furosemide in oliguric acute kidney injury (AKI) management, some patients may 
benefit from furosemide administration at an early stage. We aimed to develop an 
explainable machine learning (ML) model to differentiate between 
furosemide-responsive (FR) and furosemide-unresponsive (FU) oliguric AKI.
METHODS: From Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care-IV (MIMIC-IV) and eICU 
Collaborative Research Database (eICU-CRD), oliguric AKI patients with urine 
output (UO) < 0.5 ml/kg/h for the first 6 h after ICU admission and furosemide 
infusion ≥ 40 mg in the following 6 h were retrospectively selected. The 
MIMIC-IV cohort was used in training a XGBoost model to predict UO > 
0.65 ml/kg/h during 6-24 h succeeding the initial 6 h for assessing oliguria, 
and it was validated in the eICU-CRD cohort. We compared the predictive 
performance of the XGBoost model with the traditional logistic regression and 
other ML models.
RESULTS: 6897 patients were included in the MIMIC-IV training cohort, with 2235 
patients in the eICU-CRD validation cohort. The XGBoost model showed an AUC of 
0.97 (95% CI: 0.96-0.98) for differentiating FR and FU oliguric AKI. It 
outperformed the logistic regression and other ML models in correctly predicting 
furosemide diuretic response, achieved 92.43% sensitivity (95% CI: 90.88-93.73%) 
and 95.12% specificity (95% CI: 93.51-96.3%).
CONCLUSION: A boosted ensemble algorithm can be used to accurately differentiate 
between patients who would and would not respond to furosemide in oliguric AKI. 
By making the model explainable, clinicians would be able to better understand 
the reasoning behind the prediction outcome and make individualized treatment.

BACKGROUND: One of the significant changes in intensive care medicine over the 
past 2 decades is the acknowledgment that improper mechanical ventilation 
settings substantially contribute to pulmonary injury in critically ill 
patients. Artificial intelligence (AI) solutions can optimize mechanical 
ventilation settings in intensive care units (ICUs) and improve patient 
outcomes. Specifically, machine learning algorithms can be trained on large 
datasets of patient information and mechanical ventilation settings. These 
algorithms can then predict patient responses to different ventilation 
strategies and suggest personalized ventilation settings for individual 
patients.
OBJECTIVE: In this study, we aimed to design and evaluate an AI solution that 
could tailor an optimal ventilator strategy for each critically ill patient who 
requires mechanical ventilation.
METHODS: We proposed a reinforcement learning-based AI solution using 
observational data from multiple ICUs in the United States. The primary outcome 
was hospital mortality. Secondary outcomes were the proportion of optimal oxygen 
saturation and the proportion of optimal mean arterial blood pressure. We 
trained our AI agent to recommend low, medium, and high levels of 3 ventilator 
settings-positive end-expiratory pressure, fraction of inspired oxygen, and 
ideal body weight-adjusted tidal volume-according to patients' health 
conditions. We defined a policy as rules guiding ventilator setting changes 
given specific clinical scenarios. Off-policy evaluation metrics were applied to 
evaluate the AI policy.
RESULTS: We studied 21,595 and 5105 patients' ICU stays from the e-Intensive 
Care Unit Collaborative Research (eICU) and Medical Information Mart for 
Intensive Care IV (MIMIC-IV) databases, respectively. Using the learned AI 
policy, we estimated the hospital mortality rate (eICU 12.1%, SD 3.1%; MIMIC-IV 
29.1%, SD 0.9%), the proportion of optimal oxygen saturation (eICU 58.7%, SD 
4.7%; MIMIC-IV 49%, SD 1%), and the proportion of optimal mean arterial blood 
pressure (eICU 31.1%, SD 4.5%; MIMIC-IV 41.2%, SD 1%). Based on multiple 
quantitative and qualitative evaluation metrics, our proposed AI solution 
outperformed observed clinical practice.
CONCLUSIONS: Our study found that customizing ventilation settings for 
individual patients led to lower estimated hospital mortality rates compared to 
actual rates. This highlights the potential effectiveness of using reinforcement 
learning methodology to develop AI models that analyze complex clinical data for 
optimizing treatment parameters. Additionally, our findings suggest the 
integration of this model into a clinical decision support system for refining 
ventilation settings, supporting the need for prospective validation trials.

OBJECTIVE: Risk stratification of patients with congestive heart failure (HF) is 
vital in clinical practice. The aim of this study was to construct a machine 
learning model to predict the in-hospital all-cause mortality for intensive care 
unit (ICU) patients with HF.
METHODS: eXtreme Gradient Boosting algorithm (XGBoost) was used to construct a 
new prediction model (XGBoost model) from the Medical Information Mart for 
Intensive Care IV database (MIMIC-IV) (training set). The eICU Collaborative 
Research Database dataset (eICU-CRD) was used for the external validation (test 
set). The XGBoost model performance was compared with a logistic regression 
model and an existing model (Get with the guideline-Heart Failure model) for 
mortality in the test set. Area under the receiver operating characteristic cure 
and Brier score were employed to evaluate the discrimination and the calibration 
of the three models. The SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) value was applied 
to explain XGBoost model and calculate the importance of its features.
RESULTS: The total of 11,156 and 9,837 patients with congestive HF from the 
training set and test set, respectively, were included in the study. In-hospital 
all-cause mortality occurred in 13.3% (1,484/11,156) and 13.4% (1,319/9,837) of 
patients, respectively. In the training set, of 17 features with the highest 
predictive value were selected into the models with LASSO regression. Acute 
Physiology Score III (APS III), age and Sequential Organ Failure Assessment 
(SOFA) were strongest predictors in SHAP. In the external validation, the 
XGBoost model performance was superior to that of conventional risk predictive 
methods, with an area under the curve of 0.771 (95% confidence interval, 
0.757-0.784) and a Brier score of 0.100. In the evaluation of clinical 
effectiveness, the machine learning model brought a positive net benefit in the 
threshold probability of 0%-90%, prompting evident competitiveness compare to 
the other two models. This model has been translated into an online calculator 
which is accessible freely to the public 
(https://nkuwangkai-app-for-mortality-prediction-app-a8mhkf.streamlit.app).
CONCLUSION: This study developed a valuable machine learning risk stratification 
tool to accurately assess and stratify the risk of in-hospital all-cause 
mortality in ICU patients with congestive HF. This model was translated into a 
web-based calculator which access freely.

Paralytic Ileus (PI) patients in the Intensive Care Unit (ICU) face a 
significant risk of death. Current predictive models for PI are often complex 
and rely on many variables, resulting in unreliable outcomes for such a serious 
health condition. Predicting mortality in ICU patients with PI is particularly 
challenging due to the vast amount of data and numerous features involved. To 
address this issue, a deep-learning predictive framework was developed using the 
Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care IV (MIMIC-IV) dataset, which 
includes data from 1017 ICU patients with PI. By employing SHAP (SHapley 
Additive exPlanations) analysis, we were able to narrow down the features to six 
distinct clinical lab items. The proposed framework, called DLMP (Deep Learning 
Model for Mortality Prediction of ICU Patients with PI), utilizes these six 
unique clinical lab items: Anion gap, Platelet, PTT, BUN, Total Bilirubin, and 
Bicarbonate, along with one demographic variable as inputs to a neural network 
consisting of only two neuron layers. DLMP achieved an outstanding prediction 
performance with an AUC score of 0.887, outperforming existing predictive models 
for ICU patients with PI. The DLMP framework significantly enhances the 
prediction of mortality for PI patients compared to traditional process mining 
and machine learning models. This model holds considerable potential for 
prognosis, enabling families to be better informed about the severity of a 
patient's condition and to prepare accordingly. Furthermore, the model is 
valuable for research purposes and clinical trials.

BACKGROUND: The broad adoption of electronic health records (EHRs) provides 
great opportunities to conduct health care research and solve various clinical 
problems in medicine. With recent advances and success, methods based on machine 
learning and deep learning have become increasingly popular in medical 
informatics. However, while many research studies utilize temporal structured 
data on predictive modeling, they typically neglect potentially valuable 
information in unstructured clinical notes. Integrating heterogeneous data types 
across EHRs through deep learning techniques may help improve the performance of 
prediction models.
METHODS: In this research, we proposed 2 general-purpose multi-modal neural 
network architectures to enhance patient representation learning by combining 
sequential unstructured notes with structured data. The proposed fusion models 
leverage document embeddings for the representation of long clinical note 
documents and either convolutional neural network or long short-term memory 
networks to model the sequential clinical notes and temporal signals, and 
one-hot encoding for static information representation. The concatenated 
representation is the final patient representation which is used to make 
predictions.
RESULTS: We evaluate the performance of proposed models on 3 risk prediction 
tasks (i.e. in-hospital mortality, 30-day hospital readmission, and long length 
of stay prediction) using derived data from the publicly available Medical 
Information Mart for Intensive Care III dataset. Our results show that by 
combining unstructured clinical notes with structured data, the proposed models 
outperform other models that utilize either unstructured notes or structured 
data only.
CONCLUSIONS: The proposed fusion models learn better patient representation by 
combining structured and unstructured data. Integrating heterogeneous data types 
across EHRs helps improve the performance of prediction models and reduce 
errors.

Sepsis triggers a harmful immune response due to infection, causing high 
mortality. Predicting sepsis outcomes early is vital. Despite machine learning's 
(ML) use in medical research, local validation within the Medical Information 
Mart for Intensive Care IV (MIMIC-IV) database is lacking. We aimed to devise a 
prognostic model, leveraging MIMIC-IV data, to predict sepsis mortality and 
validate it in a Chinese teaching hospital. MIMIC-IV provided patient data, 
split into training and internal validation sets. Four ML models logistic 
regression (LR), support vector machine (SVM), deep neural networks (DNN), and 
extreme gradient boosting (XGBoost) were employed. Shapley additive 
interpretation offered early and interpretable mortality predictions. Area under 
the ROC curve (AUROC) gaged predictive performance. Results were cross verified 
in a Chinese teaching hospital. The study included 27,134 sepsis patients from 
MIMIC-IV and 487 from China. After comparing, 52 clinical indicators were 
selected for ML model development. All models exhibited excellent discriminative 
ability. XGBoost surpassed others, with AUROC of 0.873 internally and 0.844 
externally. XGBoost outperformed other ML models (LR: 0.829; SVM: 0.830; DNN: 
0.837) and clinical scores (Simplified Acute Physiology Score II: 0.728; 
Sequential Organ Failure Assessment: 0.728; Oxford Acute Severity of Illness 
Score: 0.738; Glasgow Coma Scale: 0.691). XGBoost's hospital mortality 
prediction achieved AUROC 0.873, sensitivity 0.818, accuracy 0.777, specificity 
0.768, and F1 score 0.551. We crafted an interpretable model for sepsis death 
risk prediction. ML algorithms surpassed traditional scores for sepsis mortality 
forecast. Validation in a Chinese teaching hospital echoed these findings.

This study aimed to establish and validate a machine learning (ML) model for 
predicting in-hospital mortality in patients with sepsis-associated acute kidney 
injury (SA-AKI). This study collected data on SA-AKI patients from 2008 to 2019 
using the Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care IV. After employing Lasso 
regression for feature selection, six ML approaches were used to build the 
model. The optimal model was chosen based on precision and area under curve 
(AUC). In addition, the best model was interpreted using SHapley Additive 
exPlanations (SHAP) values and Local Interpretable Model-Agnostic Explanations 
(LIME) algorithms. There were 8129 sepsis patients eligible for participation; 
the median age was 68.7 (interquartile range: 57.2-79.6) years, and 57.9% 
(4708/8129) were male. After selection, 24 of the 44 clinical characteristics 
gathered after intensive care unit admission remained linked with prognosis and 
were utilized developing ML models. Among the six models developed, the eXtreme 
Gradient Boosting (XGBoost) model had the highest AUC, at 0.794. According to 
the SHAP values, the sequential organ failure assessment score, respiration, 
simplified acute physiology score II, and age were the four most influential 
variables in the XGBoost model. Individualized forecasts were clarified using 
the LIME algorithm. We built and verified ML models that excel in early 
mortality risk prediction in SA-AKI and the XGBoost model performed best.

BACKGROUND: Clinical notes contain contextualized information beyond structured 
data related to patients' past and current health status.
OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to design a multimodal deep learning approach to 
improve the evaluation precision of hospital outcomes for heart failure (HF) 
using admission clinical notes and easily collected tabular data.
METHODS: Data for the development and validation of the multimodal model were 
retrospectively derived from 3 open-access US databases, including the Medical 
Information Mart for Intensive Care III v1.4 (MIMIC-III) and MIMIC-IV v1.0, 
collected from a teaching hospital from 2001 to 2019, and the eICU Collaborative 
Research Database v1.2, collected from 208 hospitals from 2014 to 2015. The 
study cohorts consisted of all patients with critical HF. The clinical notes, 
including chief complaint, history of present illness, physical examination, 
medical history, and admission medication, as well as clinical variables 
recorded in electronic health records, were analyzed. We developed a deep 
learning mortality prediction model for in-hospital patients, which underwent 
complete internal, prospective, and external evaluation. The Integrated 
Gradients and SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) methods were used to analyze 
the importance of risk factors.
RESULTS: The study included 9989 (16.4%) patients in the development set, 2497 
(14.1%) patients in the internal validation set, 1896 (18.3%) in the prospective 
validation set, and 7432 (15%) patients in the external validation set. The area 
under the receiver operating characteristic curve of the models was 0.838 (95% 
CI 0.827-0.851), 0.849 (95% CI 0.841-0.856), and 0.767 (95% CI 0.762-0.772), for 
the internal, prospective, and external validation sets, respectively. The area 
under the receiver operating characteristic curve of the multimodal model 
outperformed that of the unimodal models in all test sets, and tabular data 
contributed to higher discrimination. The medical history and physical 
examination were more useful than other factors in early assessments.
CONCLUSIONS: The multimodal deep learning model for combining admission notes 
and clinical tabular data showed promising efficacy as a potentially novel 
method in evaluating the risk of mortality in patients with HF, providing more 
accurate and timely decision support.

OBJECTIVE: We introduce fold-stratified cross-validation, a validation 
methodology that is compatible with privacy-preserving federated learning and 
that prevents data leakage caused by duplicates of electronic health records 
(EHRs).
MATERIALS AND METHODS: Fold-stratified cross-validation complements 
cross-validation with an initial stratification of EHRs in folds containing 
patients with similar characteristics, thus ensuring that duplicates of a record 
are jointly present either in training or in validation folds. Monte Carlo 
simulations are performed to investigate the properties of fold-stratified 
cross-validation in the case of a model data analysis using both synthetic data 
and MIMIC-III (Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care-III) medical records.
RESULTS: In situations in which duplicated EHRs could induce overoptimistic 
estimations of accuracy, applying fold-stratified cross-validation prevented 
this bias, while not requiring full deduplication. However, a pessimistic bias 
might appear if the covariate used for the stratification was strongly 
associated with the outcome.
DISCUSSION: Although fold-stratified cross-validation presents low computational 
overhead, to be efficient it requires the preliminary identification of a 
covariate that is both shared by duplicated records and weakly associated with 
the outcome. When available, the hash of a personal identifier or a patient's 
date of birth provides such a covariate. On the contrary, pseudonymization 
interferes with fold-stratified cross-validation, as it may break the equality 
of the stratifying covariate among duplicates.
CONCLUSION: Fold-stratified cross-validation is an easy-to-implement methodology 
that prevents data leakage when a model is trained on distributed EHRs that 
contain duplicates, while preserving privacy.

Background: An early diagnosis model with clinical phenotype classification is 
key for the early identification and precise treatment of sepsis-associated 
acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). This study aimed to: 1) build a 
machine learning diagnostic model for patients with sepsis-associated ARDS using 
easily accessible early clinical indicators, 2) conduct rapid classification of 
clinical phenotypes in this population, and 3) explore the differences in 
clinical characteristics, outcomes, and treatment responses of different 
phenotypes. Methods: This study is based on data from the Telehealth Intensive 
Care Unit (eICU) and Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care IV (MIMIC-IV). 
We trained and tested the early diagnostic model of sepsis-associated ARDS 
patients in the eICU. We used key predictive indicators to cluster 
sepsis-associated ARDS patients and determine the characteristics and clinical 
outcomes of different phenotypes, as well to explore the differences of 
in-hospital mortality among different the positive end-expiratory pressure 
(PEEP) levels in different phenotypes. These results are verified in MIMIC-IV to 
evaluate whether they are repeatable. Results: Among the diagnostic models 
constructed in 19,249 sepsis patients and 5,947 sepsis-associated ARDS patients, 
the AdaBoost (Decision Tree) model achieved the best performance with an area 
under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) of 0.895, which is 
higher than that of the traditional Logistic Regression model (Z = -2.40,p = 
0.013), and the accuracy of 70.06%, sensitivity of 78.11% and specificity of 
78.74%. We simultaneously identified three sepsis-associated ARDS phenotypes. 
Cluster 0 (n = 3,669) had the lowest in-hospital mortality rate (6.51%) and 
fewer laboratory abnormalities (lower WBC (median:15.000 K/mcL), lower blood 
glucose (median:158.000 mg/dl), lower creatinine (median:1.200 mg/dl), lower 
lactic acid (median:3.000 mmol/L); p < 0.001). Cluster 1 (n = 1,554) had the 
highest in-hospital mortality rate (75.29%) and the most laboratory 
abnormalities (higher WBC (median:18.300 K/mcL), higher blood glucose 
(median:188.000 mg/dl), higher creatinine (median:2.300 mg/dl), higher lactic 
acid (median:3.900 mmol/L); p < 0.001). Cluster 2 (n = 724) had the most complex 
condition, with a moderate in-hospital mortality rate (29.7%) and the longest 
intensive care unit stay. In Clusters 0 and 1, patients with high PEEP had 
higher in-hospital mortality rate than those with low PEEP, but the opposite 
trend was seen in Cluster 2. These results were repeatable in 11,935 patients 
with sepsis and 2,699 patients with sepsis-associated ARDS patients in the 
MIMIC-IV cohort. Conclusion: A machine learning diagnostic model of 
sepsis-associated ARDS patients was established. Three phenotypes with different 
clinical features and outcomes were clustered, and these had different 
therapeutic responses. These findings are helpful for the early and rapid 
identification of sepsis-associated ARDS patients and their precise 
individualized treatment.

OBJECTIVE: For patients in the Intensive Care Unit (ICU), the timing of 
intubation has a significant association with patients' outcomes. However, 
accurate prediction of the timing of intubation remains an unsolved challenge 
due to the noisy, sparse, heterogeneous, and unbalanced nature of ICU data. In 
this study, our objective is to develop a workflow for pre-processing ICU data 
and to develop a customized deep learning model to predict the need for 
intubation.
METHODS: To improve the prediction accuracy, we transform the intubation 
prediction task into a time series classification task. We carefully design a 
sequence of data pre-processing steps to handle the multimodal noisy data. 
Firstly, we discretize the sequential data and address missing data using 
interpolation. Next, we employ a sampling strategy to address data imbalance and 
standardize the data to facilitate faster model convergence. Furthermore, we 
employ the feature selection technique and propose an ensemble model to combine 
features learned by different deep learning models.
RESULTS: The performance is evaluated on Medical Information Mart for Intensive 
Care (MIMIC)-III, an ICU dataset. Our proposed Deep Feature Fusion method 
achieves an area under the curve (AUC) of the receiver operating curve (ROC) of 
0.8953, surpassing the performance of other deep learning and traditional 
machine learning models.
CONCLUSION: Our proposed Deep Feature Fusion method proves to be a viable 
approach for predicting intubation and outperforms other deep learning and 
classical machine learning models. The study confirms that high-frequency 
time-varying indicators, particularly Mean Blood Pressure (MeanBP) and 
peripheral oxygen saturation (SpO2), are significant risk factors for predicting 
intubation.

BACKGROUND: We aimed to develop an early warning system for real-time sepsis 
prediction in the ICU by machine learning methods, with tools for interpretative 
analysis of the predictions. In particular, we focus on the deployment of the 
system in a target medical center with small historical samples.
METHODS: Light Gradient Boosting Machine (LightGBM) and multilayer perceptron 
(MLP) were trained on Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care (MIMIC-III) 
dataset and then finetuned on the private Historical Database of local Ruijin 
Hospital (HDRJH) using transfer learning technique. The Shapley Additive 
Explanations (SHAP) analysis was employed to characterize the feature importance 
in the prediction inference. Ultimately, the performance of the sepsis 
prediction system was further evaluated in the real-world study in the ICU of 
the target Ruijin Hospital.
RESULTS: The datasets comprised 6891 patients from MIMIC-III, 453 from HDRJH, 
and 67 from Ruijin real-world data. The area under the receiver operating 
characteristic curves (AUCs) for LightGBM and MLP models derived from MIMIC-III 
were 0.98 - 0.98 and 0.95 - 0.96 respectively on MIMIC-III dataset, and, in 
comparison, 0.82 - 0.86 and 0.84 - 0.87 respectively on HDRJH, from 1 to  5 h 
preceding. After transfer learning and ensemble learning, the AUCs of the final 
ensemble model were enhanced to 0.94 - 0.94 on HDRJH and to 0.86 - 0.9 in the 
real-world study in the ICU of the target Ruijin Hospital. In addition, the SHAP 
analysis illustrated the importance of age, antibiotics, net balance, and 
ventilation for sepsis prediction, making the model interpretable.
CONCLUSIONS: Our machine learning model allows accurate real-time prediction of 
sepsis within 5-h preceding. Transfer learning can effectively improve the 
feasibility to deploy the prediction model in the target cohort, and ameliorate 
the model performance for external validation. SHAP analysis indicates that the 
role of antibiotic usage and fluid management needs further investigation. We 
argue that our system and methodology have the potential to improve ICU 
management by helping medical practitioners identify at-sepsis-risk patients and 
prepare for timely diagnosis and intervention.

BACKGROUND: Machine learning (ML) has been used to build high performance 
prediction model. Patients with congestive heart failure (CHF) are vulnerable to 
acute kidney injury (AKI) which makes treatment difficult. We aimed to establish 
an ML-based prediction model for the early identification of AKI in patients 
with CHF.
METHODS: Patients data were extracted from the Medical Information Mart for 
Intensive Care III (MIMIC-III) database, and patients with CHF were selected. 
Comparisons between several common ML classifiers were conducted to select the 
best prediction model. Recursive feature elimination (RFE) was used to select 
important prediction features. The model was improved using hyperparameters 
optimization (HPO). The final model was validated using an external validation 
set from the eICU Collaborative Research Database. The area under the receiver 
operating characteristic curve (AUROC), accuracy, calibration curve and decision 
curve analysis were used to evaluate prediction performance. Additionally, the 
final model was used to predict renal replacement therapy (RRT) requirement and 
to assess the short-term prognosis of patients with CHF. Finally, a software 
program was developed based on the selected features, which could intuitively 
report the probability of AKI.
RESULTS: A total of 8,580 patients with CHF were included, among whom 2,364 were 
diagnosed with AKI. The LightGBM model showed the best prediction performance 
(AUROC = 0.803) among the 13 ML-based models. After RFE and HPO, the final model 
was established with 18 features including serum creatinine (SCr), blood urea 
nitrogen (BUN) and urine output (UO). The prediction performance of LightGBM was 
better than that of measuring SCr, UO or SCr combined with UO (AUROCs: 0.809, 
0.703, 0.560 and 0.714, respectively). Additionally, the final model could 
accurately predict RRT requirement in patients with (AUROC = 0.954). Moreover, 
the participants were divided into high- and low-risk groups for AKI, and the 
90-day mortality in the high-risk group was significantly higher than that in 
the low-risk group (log-rank p < 0.001). Finally, external validation using the 
eICU database comprising 9,749 patients with CHF revealed satisfactory 
prediction outcomes (AUROC = 0.816).
CONCLUSION: A prediction model for AKI in patients with CHF was established 
based on LightGBM, and the prediction performance of this model was better than 
that of other models. This model may help in predicting RRT requirement and in 
identifying the population with poor prognosis among patients with CHF.

BACKGROUND: Acinetobacter baumanni infection is a leading cause of morbidity and 
mortality in the Intensive Care Unit (ICU). Early recognition of patients at 
risk for infection allows early proper treatment and is associated with improved 
outcomes. This study aimed to construct an innovative Machine Learning (ML) 
based prediction tool for Acinetobacter baumanni infection, among patients in 
the ICU, and to examine its robustness and predictive power.
METHODS: For model development and internal validation, we used The Medical 
Information Mart for Intensive Care database (MIMIC) III data from 19,690 
consecutive adult patients admitted between 2001 and 2012 at a Boston tertiary 
center ICU. For external validation, we used a different dataset from Rabin 
Medical Center (RMC, Israeli tertiary center) ICU, of 1,700 patients admitted 
between 2017 and 2021. After training on MIMIC cohorts, we adapted the algorithm 
from MIMIC to RMC and evaluated its discriminating power in terms of Area Under 
the Receiver Operating Curve (AUROC), sensitivity, specificity, Negative 
Predictive Value and Positive Predictive Value.
RESULTS: The prediction model achieved AUROC = 0.624 (95% CI 0.604-0.647). The 
most significant predictors were (i) physiological parameters of 
cardio-respiratory function, such as carbon dioxide (CO2) levels and respiratory 
rate, (ii) metabolic disturbances such as lactate and acidosis (pH) and (iii) 
past administration of antibiotics.
CONCLUSIONS: Infection with Acinetobacter baumanni is more likely to occur in 
patients with respiratory failure and higher lactate levels, as well as patients 
who have used larger amounts of antibiotics. The accuracy of Acinetobacter 
prediction may be enhanced by future studies.

BACKGROUND: Bacterial bloodstream infection is responsible for the majority of 
cases of sepsis and septic shock. Early recognition of the causative pathogen is 
pivotal for administration of adequate empiric antibiotic therapy and for the 
survival of the patients. In this study, we developed a feasible machine 
learning (ML) model to predict gram-positive and gram-negative bacteremia based 
on routine laboratory parameters.
METHODS: Data for 2118 patients with bacteremia were obtained from the Medical 
Information Mart for Intensive Care dataset. Patients were randomly split into 
the training set and test set by stratified sampling, and 374 routine laboratory 
blood test variables were retrieved. Variables with missing values in more than 
40% of the patients were excluded. Pearson correlation test was employed to 
eliminate redundant features. Five ML algorithms were used to build the model 
based on the selected features. Additionally, 132 patients with bacteremia who 
were treated at Qilu Hospital of Shandong University were included in an 
independent test cohort to evaluate the model.
RESULTS: After feature selection, 32 variables remained. All the five ML 
algorithms performed well in terms of discriminating between gram-positive and 
gram-negative bacteremia, but the performance of convolutional neural network 
(CNN) and random forest (RF) were better than other three algorithms. Consider 
of the interpretability of models, RF was chosen for further test 
(ROC-AUC = 0.768; 95%CI = 0.715-0.798, with a sensitivity of 75.20% and a 
specificity of 63.79%). To expand the application of the model, a decision tree 
(DT) was built utilizing the major variables, and it achieved an AUC of 0.679 
(95%CI = 0.632-0.723), a sensitivity of 66%, and a specificity of 67.82% in the 
test cohort. When tested in the Qilu Hospital cohort, the ROC-AUC of the RF and 
DT models were 0.666 (95%CI = 0.579-0.746) and 0.615 (95%CI = 0.526-0.698), 
respectively. Finally, a software was developed to make the RF- and DT-based 
prediction models easily accessible.
CONCLUSION: The present ML-based models could effectively discriminate between 
gram-positive and gram-negative bacteremia based on routine laboratory blood 
test results. This simple model would be beneficial in terms of guiding timely 
antibiotic selection and administration in critically ill patients with 
bacteremia before their pathogen test results are available.

BACKGROUND: Advances in artificial intelligence (AI) have realized the potential 
of revolutionizing healthcare, such as predicting disease progression via 
longitudinal inspection of Electronic Health Records (EHRs) and lab tests from 
patients admitted to Intensive Care Units (ICU). Although substantial literature 
exists addressing broad subjects, including the prediction of mortality, 
length-of-stay, and readmission, studies focusing on forecasting Acute Kidney 
Injury (AKI), specifically dialysis anticipation like Continuous Renal 
Replacement Therapy (CRRT) are scarce. The technicality of how to implement AI 
remains elusive.
OBJECTIVE: This study aims to elucidate the important factors and methods that 
are required to develop effective predictive models of AKI and CRRT for patients 
admitted to ICU, using EHRs in the Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care 
(MIMIC) database.
METHODS: We conducted a comprehensive comparative analysis of established 
predictive models, considering both time-series measurements and clinical notes 
from MIMIC-IV databases. Subsequently, we proposed a novel multi-modal model 
which integrates embeddings of top-performing unimodal models, including Long 
Short-Term Memory (LSTM) and BioMedBERT, and leverages both unstructured 
clinical notes and structured time series measurements derived from EHRs to 
enable the early prediction of AKI and CRRT.
RESULTS: Our multimodal model achieved a lead time of at least 12 h ahead of 
clinical manifestation, with an Area Under the Receiver Operating Characteristic 
Curve (AUROC) of 0.888 for AKI and 0.997 for CRRT, as well as an Area Under the 
Precision Recall Curve (AUPRC) of 0.727 for AKI and 0.840 for CRRT, 
respectively, which significantly outperformed the baseline models. 
Additionally, we performed a SHapley Additive exPlanation (SHAP) analysis using 
the expected gradients algorithm, which highlighted important, previously 
underappreciated predictive features for AKI and CRRT.
CONCLUSION: Our study revealed the importance and the technicality of applying 
longitudinal, multimodal modeling to improve early prediction of AKI and CRRT, 
offering insights for timely interventions. The performance and interpretability 
of our model indicate its potential for further assessment towards clinical 
applications, to ultimately optimize AKI management and enhance patient 
outcomes.

RATIONALE: Patients transferred from the intensive care unit to the wards who 
are later readmitted to the intensive care unit have increased length of stay, 
healthcare expenditure, and mortality compared with those who are never 
readmitted. Improving risk stratification for patients transferred to the wards 
could have important benefits for critically ill hospitalized patients.
OBJECTIVES: We aimed to use a machine-learning technique to derive and validate 
an intensive care unit readmission prediction model with variables available in 
the electronic health record in real time and compare it to previously published 
algorithms.
METHODS: This observational cohort study was conducted at an academic hospital 
in the United States with approximately 600 inpatient beds. A total of 24,885 
intensive care unit transfers to the wards were included, with 14,962 transfers 
(60%) in the training cohort and 9,923 transfers (40%) in the internal 
validation cohort. Patient characteristics, nursing assessments, International 
Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision codes from prior admissions, 
medications, intensive care unit interventions, diagnostic tests, vital signs, 
and laboratory results were extracted from the electronic health record and used 
as predictor variables in a gradient-boosted machine model. Accuracy for 
predicting intensive care unit readmission was compared with the Stability and 
Workload Index for Transfer score and Modified Early Warning Score in the 
internal validation cohort and also externally using the Medical Information 
Mart for Intensive Care database (n = 42,303 intensive care unit transfers).
RESULTS: Eleven percent (2,834) of discharges to the wards were later readmitted 
to the intensive care unit. The machine-learning-derived model had significantly 
better performance (area under the receiver operating curve, 0.76) than either 
the Stability and Workload Index for Transfer score (area under the receiver 
operating curve, 0.65), or Modified Early Warning Score (area under the receiver 
operating curve, 0.58; P value < 0.0001 for all comparisons). At a specificity 
of 95%, the derived model had a sensitivity of 28% compared with 15% for 
Stability and Workload Index for Transfer score and 7% for the Modified Early 
Warning Score. Accuracy improvements with the derived model over Modified Early 
Warning Score and Stability and Workload Index for Transfer were similar in the 
Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care-III cohort.
CONCLUSIONS: A machine learning approach to predicting intensive care unit 
readmission was significantly more accurate than previously published algorithms 
in both our internal validation and the Medical Information Mart for Intensive 
Care-III cohort. Implementation of this approach could target patients who may 
benefit from additional time in the intensive care unit or more frequent 
monitoring after transfer to the hospital ward.

BACKGROUND: The burden of atrial fibrillation (AF) in the intensive care unit 
(ICU) remains heavy. Glycaemic control is important in the AF management. 
Glycaemic variability (GV), an emerging marker of glycaemic control, is 
associated with unfavourable prognosis, and abnormal GV is prevalent in ICUs. 
However, the impact of GV on the prognosis of AF patients in the ICU remains 
uncertain. This study aimed to evaluate the relationship between GV and 
all-cause mortality after ICU admission at short-, medium-, and long-term 
intervals in AF patients.
METHODS: Data was obtained from the Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care 
IV 3.0 database, with admissions (2008-2019) as primary analysis cohort and 
admissions (2020-2022) as external validation cohort. Multivariate Cox 
proportional hazards models, and restricted cubic spline analyses were used to 
assess the associations between GV and mortality outcomes. Subsequently, GV and 
other clinical features were used to construct machine learning (ML) prediction 
models for 30-day all-cause mortality after ICU admission.
RESULTS: The primary analysis cohort included 8989 AF patients (age 76.5 
[67.7-84.3] years; 57.8% male), while the external validation cohort included 
837 AF patients (age 72.9 [65.3-80.2] years; 67.4% male). Multivariate Cox 
proportional hazards models revealed that higher GV quartiles were associated 
with higher risk of 30-day (Q3: HR 1.19, 95%CI 1.04-1.37; Q4: HR 1.33, 95%CI 
1.16-1.52), 90-day (Q3: HR 1.25, 95%CI 1.11-1.40; Q4: HR 1.34, 95%CI 1.29-1.50), 
and 360-day (Q3: HR 1.21, 95%CI 1.09-1.33; Q4: HR 1.33, 95%CI 1.20-1.47) 
all-cause mortality, compared with lowest GV quartile. Moreover, our data 
suggests that GV needs to be contained within 20.0%. Among all ML models, light 
gradient boosting machine had the best performance (internal validation: AUC 
[0.780], G-mean [0.551], F1-score [0.533]; external validation: AUC [0.788], 
G-mean [0.578], F1-score [0.568]).
CONCLUSION: GV is a significant predictor of ICU short-term, mid-term, and 
long-term all-cause mortality in patients with AF (the potential risk 
stratification threshold is 20.0%). ML models incorporating GV demonstrated high 
efficiency in predicting short-term mortality and GV was ranked anterior in 
importance. These findings underscore the potential of GV as a valuable 
biomarker in guiding clinical decisions and improving patient outcomes in this 
high-risk population.

OBJECTIVE: To explore an artificial intelligence approach based on 
gradient-boosted decision trees for prediction of all-cause mortality at an 
intensive care unit, comparing its performance to a recent logistic regression 
system in the literature, and a logistic regression model built on the same 
platform.
METHODS: A gradient-boosted decision trees model and a logistic regression model 
were trained and tested with the Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care 
database. The 1-hour resolution physiological measurements of adult patients, 
collected during 5 hours in the intensive care unit, consisted of eight routine 
clinical parameters. The study addressed how the models learn to categorize 
patients to predict intensive care unit mortality or survival within 12 hours. 
The performance was evaluated with accuracy statistics and the area under the 
Receiver Operating Characteristic curve.
RESULTS: The gradient-boosted trees yielded an area under the Receiver Operating 
Characteristic curve of 0.89, compared to 0.806 for the logistic regression. The 
accuracy was 0.814 for the gradient-boosted trees, compared to 0.782 for the 
logistic regression. The diagnostic odds ratio was 17.823 for the 
gradient-boosted trees, compared to 9.254 for the logistic regression. The 
Cohen's kappa, F-measure, Matthews correlation coefficient, and markedness were 
higher for the gradient-boosted trees.
CONCLUSION: The discriminatory power of the gradient-boosted trees was 
excellent. The gradient-boosted trees outperformed the logistic regression 
regarding intensive care unit mortality prediction. The high diagnostic odds 
ratio and markedness values for the gradient-boosted trees are important in the 
context of the studied unbalanced dataset.

OBJETIVO: Explorar uma abordagem de inteligência artificial baseada em árvores 
de decisão impulsionadas por gradiente para previsão de mortalidade por todas as 
causas em unidade de terapia intensiva, comparando seu desempenho com um sistema 
de regressão logística recente na literatura e um modelo de regressão logística 
construído na mesma plataforma.
MÉTODOS: Foram desenvolvidos um modelo de árvores impulsionadas por gradiente e 
um modelo de regressão logística, treinados e testados com o banco de dados 
Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care. As medidas fisiológicas de 
pacientes adultos com resolução de 1 hora, coletadas durante 5 horas na unidade 
de terapia intensiva, consistiram em oito parâmetros clínicos de rotina. 
Estudou-se como os modelos aprendem a categorizar os pacientes para prever a 
mortalidade ou a sobrevida, em unidades de terapia intensiva, em 12 horas. O 
desempenho foi avaliado por meio de estatísticas de acurácia e pela área sob a 
curva Característica de Operação do Receptor.
RESULTADOS: As árvores impulsionadas por gradiente produziram área sob a curva 
Característica de Operação do Receptor de 0,89, em comparação com 0,806 para a 
regressão logística. A acurácia foi de 0,814 para as árvores impulsionadas por 
gradiente, em comparação com 0,782 para a regressão logística. A razão de 
chances de diagnóstico foi de 17,823 para as árvores impulsionadas por 
gradiente, em comparação a 9,254 para a regressão logística. O kappa de Cohen, a 
medida F, o coeficiente de correlação de Matthews e a marcação foram maiores 
para as árvores impulsionadas por gradiente.
CONCLUSÃO: O poder discriminatório das árvores impulsionadas por gradiente foi 
excelente. As árvores impulsionadas por gradiente superaram a regressão 
logística em relação à previsão de mortalidade em unidade de terapia intensiva. 
A alta razão de chances de diagnóstico e os valores de marcação para as árvores 
impulsionadas por gradiente são importantes no contexto do conjunto de dados não 
balanceados estudado.

BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Sepsis-associated AKI is a heterogeneous clinical 
entity. We aimed to agnostically identify sepsis-associated AKI subphenotypes 
using deep learning on routinely collected data in electronic health records.
DESIGN, SETTING, PARTICIPANTS, & MEASUREMENTS: We used the Medical Information 
Mart for Intensive Care III database, which consists of electronic health record 
data from intensive care units in a tertiary care hospital in the United States. 
We included patients ≥18 years with sepsis who developed AKI within 48 hours of 
intensive care unit admission. We then used deep learning to utilize all 
available vital signs, laboratory measurements, and comorbidities to identify 
subphenotypes. Outcomes were mortality 28 days after AKI and dialysis 
requirement.
RESULTS: We identified 4001 patients with sepsis-associated AKI. We utilized 
2546 combined features for K-means clustering, identifying three subphenotypes. 
Subphenotype 1 had 1443 patients, and subphenotype 2 had 1898 patients, whereas 
subphenotype 3 had 660 patients. Subphenotype 1 had the lowest proportion of 
liver disease and lowest Simplified Acute Physiology Score II scores compared 
with subphenotypes 2 and 3. The proportions of patients with CKD were similar 
between subphenotypes 1 and 3 (15%) but highest in subphenotype 2 (21%). 
Subphenotype 1 had lower median bilirubin levels, aspartate aminotransferase, 
and alanine aminotransferase compared with subphenotypes 2 and 3. Patients in 
subphenotype 1 also had lower median lactate, lactate dehydrogenase, and white 
blood cell count than patients in subphenotypes 2 and 3. Subphenotype 1 also had 
lower creatinine and BUN than subphenotypes 2 and 3. Dialysis requirement was 
lowest in subphenotype 1 (4% versus 7% [subphenotype 2] versus 26% [subphenotype 
3]). The mortality 28 days after AKI was lowest in subphenotype 1 (23% versus 
35% [subphenotype 2] versus 49% [subphenotype 3]). After adjustment, the 
adjusted odds ratio for mortality for subphenotype 3, with subphenotype 1 as a 
reference, was 1.9 (95% confidence interval, 1.5 to 2.4).
CONCLUSIONS: Utilizing routinely collected laboratory variables, vital signs, 
and comorbidities, we were able to identify three distinct subphenotypes of 
sepsis-associated AKI with differing outcomes.

The utilization of artificial intelligence (AI) in healthcare is on the rise, 
demanding increased accessibility to (public) medical data for benchmarking. The 
digitization of healthcare in recent years has facilitated medical data 
scientists' access to extensive hospital data, fostering AI-based research. A 
notable addition to this trend is the Salzburg Intensive Care database (SICdb), 
made publicly available in early 2023. Covering over 27 thousand intensive care 
admissions at the University Hospital Salzburg from 2013 to 2021, this dataset 
presents a valuable resource for AI-driven investigations. This article explores 
the SICdb and conducts a comparative analysis with the widely recognized Medical 
Information Mart for Intensive Care - version IV (MIMIC-IV) database. The 
comparison focuses on key aspects, emphasizing the availability and granularity 
of data provided by the SICdb, particularly vital signs and laboratory 
measurements. The analysis demonstrates that the SICdb offers more detailed 
information with higher data availability and temporal resolution for signal 
data, especially for vital signs, compared to the MIMIC-IV. This is advantageous 
for longitudinal studies of patients' health conditions in the intensive care 
unit. The SICdb provides a valuable resource for medical data scientists and 
researchers. The database offers comprehensive and diverse healthcare data in a 
European country, making it well suited for benchmarking and enhancing AI-based 
healthcare research. The importance of ongoing efforts to expand and make public 
datasets available for advancing AI applications in the healthcare domain is 
emphasized by the findings.

To improve the performance of Intensive Care Units (ICUs), the field of 
bio-statistics has developed scores which try to predict the likelihood of 
negative outcomes. These help evaluate the effectiveness of treatments and 
clinical practice, and also help to identify patients with unexpected outcomes. 
However, they have been shown by several studies to offer sub-optimal 
performance. Alternatively, Deep Learning offers state of the art capabilities 
in certain prediction tasks and research suggests deep neural networks are able 
to outperform traditional techniques. Nevertheless, a main impediment for the 
adoption of Deep Learning in healthcare is its reduced interpretability, for in 
this field it is crucial to gain insight into the why of predictions, to assure 
that models are actually learning relevant features instead of spurious 
correlations. To address this, we propose a deep multi-scale convolutional 
architecture trained on the Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care III 
(MIMIC-III) for mortality prediction, and the use of concepts from coalitional 
game theory to construct visual explanations aimed to show how important these 
inputs are deemed by the network. Results show our model attains a ROC AUC of 
0.8735 (± 0.0025) which is competitive with the state of the art of Deep 
Learning mortality models trained on MIMIC-III data, while remaining 
interpretable. Supporting code can be found at

variational inference.

OBJECTIVE: Machine learning applications for longitudinal electronic health 
records often forecast the risk of events at fixed time points, whereas survival 
analysis achieves dynamic risk prediction by estimating time-to-event 
distributions. Here, we propose a novel conditional variational 
autoencoder-based method, DySurv, which uses a combination of static and 
longitudinal measurements from electronic health records to estimate the 
individual risk of death dynamically.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: DySurv directly estimates the cumulative risk incidence 
function without making any parametric assumptions on the underlying stochastic 
process of the time-to-event. We evaluate DySurv on 6 time-to-event benchmark 
datasets in healthcare, as well as 2 real-world intensive care unit (ICU) 
electronic health records (EHR) datasets extracted from the eICU Collaborative 
Research (eICU) and the Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care database 
(MIMIC-IV).
RESULTS: DySurv outperforms other existing statistical and deep learning 
approaches to time-to-event analysis across concordance and other metrics. It 
achieves time-dependent concordance of over 60% in the eICU case. It is also 
over 12% more accurate and 22% more sensitive than in-use ICU scores like Acute 
Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation (APACHE) and Sequential Organ Failure 
Assessment (SOFA) scores. The predictive capacity of DySurv is consistent and 
the survival estimates remain disentangled across different datasets.
DISCUSSION: Our interdisciplinary framework successfully incorporates deep 
learning, survival analysis, and intensive care to create a novel method for 
time-to-event prediction from longitudinal health records. We test our method on 
several held-out test sets from a variety of healthcare datasets and compare it 
to existing in-use clinical risk scoring benchmarks.
CONCLUSION: While our method leverages non-parametric extensions to deep 
learning-guided estimations of the survival distribution, further deep learning 
paradigms could be explored.

BACKGROUND: The identification of efficient predictors for short-term mortality 
among patients with myocardial infarction (MI) in coronary care units (CCU) 
remains a challenge. This study seeks to investigate the potential of machine 
learning (ML) to improve risk prediction and develop a predictive model 
specifically tailored for 30-day mortality in critical MI patients.
METHOD: This study focused on MI patients extracted from the Medical Information 
Mart for Intensive Care-IV database. The patient cohort was randomly stratified 
into derivation (n = 1,389, 70%) and validation (n = 595, 30%) groups. 
Independent risk factors were identified through eXtreme Gradient Boosting 
(XGBoost) and random decision forest (RDF) methodologies. Subsequently, 
multivariate logistic regression analysis was employed to construct predictive 
models. The discrimination, calibration and clinical utility were assessed 
utilizing metrics such as receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve, 
calibration plot and decision curve analysis (DCA).
RESULT: A total of 1,984 patients were identified (mean [SD] age, 69.4 [13.0] 
years; 659 [33.2%] female). The predictive performance of the XGBoost and 
RDF-based models demonstrated similar efficacy. Subsequently, a 30-day mortality 
prediction algorithm was developed using the same selected variables, and a 
regression model was visually represented through a nomogram. In the validation 
group, the nomogram (Area Under the Curve [AUC]: 0.835, 95% Confidence Interval 
[CI]: [0.774-0.897]) exhibited superior discriminative capability for 30-day 
mortality compared to the Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (SOFA) score [AUC: 
0.735, 95% CI: (0.662-0.809)]. The nomogram (Accuracy: 0.914) and the SOFA score 
(Accuracy: 0.913) demonstrated satisfactory calibration. DCA indicated that the 
nomogram outperformed the SOFA score, providing a net benefit in predicting 
mortality.
CONCLUSION: The ML-based predictive model demonstrated significant efficacy in 
forecasting 30-day mortality among MI patients admitted to the CCU. The 
prognostic factors identified were age, blood urea nitrogen, heart rate, pulse 
oximetry-derived oxygen saturation, bicarbonate, and metoprolol use. This model 
serves as a valuable decision-making tool for clinicians.

OBJECTIVE: This study aims to construct and compare four machine learning models 
using the MIMIC-IV database to identify high-risk factors for 
multidrug-resistant organism (MDRO) infection in Ventilator-associated pneumonia 
(VAP) patients.
METHODS: The study included 972 VAP patients from the MIMIC-IV database. Data 
encompassing demographic information, vital signs, laboratory results, and other 
relevant variables were collected. The class imbalance issue was addressed using 
the Synthetic Minority Over-sampling Technique (SMOTE). The dataset was randomly 
split into training and testing sets (8:2). LASSO regression and feature 
importance scores were used for feature selection. Clinical prediction models 
were built using logistic regression, XGBoost, random forest and gradient 
boosting machine. The performance of the models was evaluated through receiver 
operating characteristic(ROC) curve analysis.Model calibration was assessed 
using calibration curves and Brier scores. The effectiveness was evaluated 
through Decision Curve Analysis (DCA). SHAP was utilized for model 
interpretation.
RESULTS: Among 972 patients, 824 were non-MDROs-VAP and 128 were MDROs-VAP. 
Comparative analysis revealed statistically significant differences in various 
clinical parameters. XGBoost exhibited the best predictive performance, 
incorporating 20 features with an AUC of 0.831 (95 % CI: 0.785-0.877) on the 
test set. Calibration curves demonstrated robust consistency, corroborated by 
Decision Curve Analysis (DCA) affirming the clinical utility. SHAP analysis 
identified the most important features: red cell distribution width, duration of 
mechanical ventilation, anion gap, basophil percentage, and neutrophil 
percentage.
CONCLUSION: This study established and compared four machine learning models for 
MDROs infections in VAP patients. XGBoost was identified as the optimal 
predictor, and SHAP values provided insights into 20 independent risk factors, 
confirming its excellent predictive value.
IMPLICATIONS FOR CLINICAL PRACTICE: VAP is a common infection in ICU patients 
with a heightened risk of MDRO and increased mortality. The recognition of high 
bias in existing models calls for future research to employ rigorous 
methodologies and robust data sources, aiming to develop and validate more 
accurate and clinically applicable predictive models for MDROs infections in VAP 
patients.

Introduction: Septic patients with atrial fibrillation (AF) are common in the 
intensive care unit accompanied by high mortality. The early prediction of 
prognosis of these patients is critical for clinical intervention. This study 
aimed to develop a model by using machine learning (ML) algorithms to predict 
the risk of 28-day mortality in septic patients with AF. Methods: In this 
retrospective cohort study, we extracted septic patients with AF from the 
Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care III (MIMIC-III) and IV database. 
Afterward, only MIMIC-IV cohort was randomly divided into training or internal 
validation set. External validation set was mainly extracted from MIMIC-III 
database. Propensity score matching was used to reduce the imbalance between the 
external validation and internal validation data sets. The predictive factors 
for 28-day mortality were determined by using multivariate logistic regression. 
Then, we constructed models by using ML algorithms. Multiple metrics were used 
for evaluation of performance of the models, including the area under the 
receiver operating characteristic curve, sensitivity, specificity, recall, and 
accuracy. Results: A total of 5,317 septic patients with AF were enrolled, with 
3,845 in the training set, 960 in the internal testing set, and 512 in the 
external testing set, respectively. Then, we established four prediction models 
by using ML algorithms. AdaBoost showed moderate performance and had a higher 
accuracy than the other three models. Compared with other severity scores, the 
AdaBoost obtained more net benefit. Conclusion: We established the first ML 
model for predicting the 28-day mortality of septic patients with AF. Compared 
with conventional scoring systems, the AdaBoost model performed moderately. The 
model established will have the potential to improve the level of clinical 
practice.

The identification of delirium in electronic health records (EHRs) remains 
difficult due to inadequate assessment or under-documentation. The purpose of 
this research is to present a classification model that identifies delirium 
using retrospective EHR data. Delirium was confirmed with the Confusion 
Assessment Method for the Intensive Care Unit. Age, sex, Elixhauser comorbidity 
index, drug exposures, and diagnoses were used as features. The model was 
developed based on the Columbia University Irving Medical Center EHR data and 
further validated with the Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care III 
dataset. Seventy-six patients from Surgical/Cardiothoracic ICU were included in 
the model. The logistic regression model achieved the best performance in 
identifying delirium; mean AUC of 0.874 ± 0.033. The mean positive predictive 
value of the logistic regression model was 0.80. The model promises to identify 
delirium cases with EHR data, thereby enable a sustainable infrastructure to 
build a retrospective cohort of delirium.

BACKGROUND: Acute kidney injury (AKI) is more likely to develop in the elderly 
admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU). Acute kidney disease (AKD) affects 
∼45% of patients with AKI and increases short-term mortality. However, there are 
no studies on the prognosis of AKD in the elderly.
METHODS: Data from 2666 elderly patients with AKD in the Medical Information 
Mart for Intensive Care IV were used for model development and 535 in the eICU 
Collaborative Research Database for external validation. Based on 5 machine 
learning algorithms, 33 noninvasive parameters were extracted as features for 
modeling.
RESULTS: In-hospital mortality of AKD in the elderly was 29.6% and 31.8% in 
development and validation cohorts, respectively. The comprehensive 
best-performing algorithm was the support vector machine (SVM), and a simplified 
online application included only 10 features employing SVM (AUC: 0.810 and 0.776 
in the training and external validation cohorts, respectively) was deployed. 
Model interpretation by SHapley Additive exPlanation (SHAP) values revealed that 
the difference (AKD day - ICU day) in sequential organ failure assessment (delta 
SOFA), Glasgow coma scale (GCS), delta GCS, delta peripheral oxygen saturation 
(SpO2), and SOFA were the top five features associated with prognosis. The 
optimal target was determined by SHAP values from partial dependence plots.
CONCLUSIONS: A web-based tool was externally validated and deployed to predict 
the early prognosis of AKD in the elderly based on readily available noninvasive 
parameters, assisting clinicians in intervening with precision and purpose to 
save lives to the greatest extent.

This study aims to develop and validate a machine learning (ML) predictive model 
for assessing mortality in patients with malignant tumors and hyperkalemia 
(MTH). We extracted data on patients with MTH from the Medical Information Mart 
for Intensive Care-IV, version 2.2 (MIMIC-IV v2.2) database. The dataset was 
split into a training set (75%) and a validation set (25%). We used the Least 
Absolute Shrinkage and Selection Operator (LASSO) regression to identify 
potential predictors, which included clinical laboratory indicators and vital 
signs. Pearson correlation analysis tested the correlation between predictors. 
In-hospital death was the prediction target. The Area Under the Curve (AUC) and 
accuracy of the training and validation sets of 7 ML algorithms were compared, 
and the optimal 1 was selected to develop the model. The calibration curve was 
used to evaluate the prediction accuracy of the model further. SHapley Additive 
exPlanations (SHAP) and Local Interpretable Model-agnostic Explanations (LIME) 
enhanced model interpretability. 496 patients with MTH in the Intensive Care 
Unit (ICU) were included. After screening, 17 clinical features were included in 
the construction of the ML model, and the Pearson correlation coefficient was 
<0.8, indicating that the correlation between the clinical features was small. 
eXtreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost) outperformed other algorithms, achieving 
perfect scores in the training set (accuracy: 1.000, AUC: 1.000) and high scores 
in the validation set (accuracy: 0.734, AUC: 0.733). The calibration curves 
indicated good predictive calibration of the model. SHAP analysis identified the 
top 8 predictive factors: urine output, mean heart rate, maximum urea nitrogen, 
minimum oxygen saturation, minimum mean blood pressure, maximum total bilirubin, 
mean respiratory rate, and minimum pH. In addition, SHAP and LIME performed 
in-depth individual case analyses. This study demonstrates the effectiveness of 
ML methods in predicting mortality risk in ICU patients with MTH. It highlights 
the importance of predictors like urine output and mean heart rate. SHAP and 
LIME significantly enhanced the model's interpretability.

OBJECTIVES: Elevated intracranial pressure (ICP) is a potentially devastating 
complication of neurologic injury. Developing an ICP prediction algorithm to 
help the clinician adjust treatments and potentially prevent elevated ICP 
episodes.
DESIGN: Retrospective study.
SETTING: Three hundred thirty-five ICUs at 208 hospitals in the United States.
SUBJECTS: Adults patients from the electronic ICU (eICU) Collaborative Research 
Database was used to train an ensemble machine learning model to predict the ICP 
30 minutes in the future. Predictive performance was evaluated using a left-out 
test dataset and externally evaluated on the Medical Information Mart for 
Intensive Care-III (MIMIC-III) Matched Waveform Database.
INTERVENTIONS: None.
MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Predictors included age, assigned sex, 
laboratories, medications and infusions, input/output, Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) 
components, and time-series vitals (heart rate, ICP, mean arterial pressure, 
respiratory rate, and temperature). Each patient ICU stay was divided into 
successive 95-minute timeblocks. For each timeblock, the model was trained on 
nontime-varying covariates as well as on 12 observations of time-varying 
covariates at 5-minute intervals and asked to predict the 5-minute median ICP 30 
minutes after the last observed ICP value. Data from 931 patients with ICP 
monitoring in the eICU dataset were extracted (46,207 timeblocks). The root mean 
squared error was 4.51 mm Hg in the eICU test set and 3.56 mm Hg in the 
MIMIC-III dataset. The most important variables driving ICP prediction were 
previous ICP history, patients' temperature, weight, serum creatinine, age, GCS, 
and hemodynamic parameters.
CONCLUSIONS: IntraCranial pressure prediction AlgoRithm using machinE learning, 
an ensemble machine learning model, trained to predict the ICP of a patient 30 
minutes in the future based on baseline characteristics and vitals data from the 
past hour showed promising predictive performance including in an external 
validation dataset.

BACKGROUND: Volume overload is a common complication encountered in hospitalized 
patients, and the mainstay of therapy is diuresis. Unfortunately, the diuretic 
response in some individuals is inadequate despite a typical dose of loop 
diuretics, a phenomenon called diuretic resistance. An accurate prediction model 
that predicts diuretic resistance using predosing variables could inform the 
right diuretic dose for a prospective patient.
METHODS: Two large, deidentified, publicly available, and independent intensive 
care unit (ICU) databases from the United States were used-the Medical 
Information Mart for Intensive Care III (MIMIC) and the Philips eICU databases. 
Loop diuretic resistance was defined as <1400 ml of urine per 40 mg of diuretic 
dose in 24 hours. Using 24-hour windows throughout admission, commonly 
accessible variables were obtained and incorporated into the model. Data 
imputation was performed using a highly accurate machine learning method. Using 
XGBoost, several models were created using train and test datasets from the eICU 
database. These were then combined into an ensemble model optimized for 
increased specificity and then externally validated on the MIMIC database.
RESULTS: The final ensemble model was composed of four separate models, each 
using 21 commonly available variables. The ensemble model outperformed 
individual models during validation. Higher serum creatinine, lower systolic 
blood pressure, lower serum chloride, higher age, and female sex were the most 
important predictors of diuretic resistance (in that order). The specificity of 
the model on external validation was 92%, yielding a positive likelihood ratio 
of 3.46 while maintaining overall discrimination (C-statistic 0.69).
CONCLUSIONS: A diuretic resistance prediction model was created using machine 
learning and was externally validated in ICU populations. The model is easy to 
use, would provide actionable information at the bedside, and would be ready for 
implementation in existing electronic medical records. This study also provides 
a framework for the development of future machine learning models.

AIM: The objective of this study is to develop accurate machine learning (ML) 
models for predicting the neurological status at hospital discharge of 
critically ill patients with hemorrhagic and ischemic stroke and identify the 
risk factors associated with the neurological outcome of stroke, thereby 
providing healthcare professionals with enhanced clinical decision-making 
guidance.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: Data of stroke patients were extracted from the eICU 
Collaborative Research Database (eICU-CRD) for training and testing sets and the 
Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care IV (MIMIC IV) database for external 
validation. Four machine learning models, namely gradient boosting classifier 
(GBC), logistic regression (LR), multi-layer perceptron (MLP), and random forest 
(RF), were used for prediction of neurological outcome. Furthermore, shapley 
additive explanations (SHAP) algorithm was applied to explain models visually.
RESULTS: A total of 1,216 hemorrhagic stroke patients and 954 ischemic stroke 
patients from eICU-CRD and 921 hemorrhagic stroke patients 902 ischemic stroke 
patients from MIMIC IV were included in this study. In the hemorrhagic stroke 
cohort, the LR model achieved the highest area under curve (AUC) of 0.887 in the 
test cohort, while in the ischemic stroke cohort, the RF model demonstrated the 
best performance with an AUC of 0.867 in the test cohort. Further analysis of 
risk factors was conducted using SHAP analysis and the results of this study 
were converted into an online prediction tool.
CONCLUSION: ML models are reliable tools for predicting hemorrhagic and ischemic 
stroke neurological outcome and have the potential to improve critical care of 
stroke patients. The summarized risk factors obtained from SHAP enable a more 
nuanced understanding of the reasoning behind prediction outcomes and the 
optimization of the treatment strategy.

BACKGROUNDS: The in-hospital mortality in lung cancer patients admitted to 
intensive care unit (ICU) is extremely high. This study intended to adopt 
machine learning algorithm models to predict in-hospital mortality of critically 
ill lung cancer for providing relative information in clinical decision-making.
METHODS: Data were extracted from the Medical Information Mart for Intensive 
Care-IV (MIMIC-IV) for a training cohort and data extracted from the Medical 
Information Mart for eICU Collaborative Research Database (eICU-CRD) database 
for a validation cohort. Logistic regression, random forest, decision tree, 
light gradient boosting machine (LightGBM), eXtreme gradient boosting (XGBoost), 
and an ensemble (random forest+LightGBM+XGBoost) model were used for prediction 
of in-hospital mortality and important feature extraction. The AUC (area under 
receiver operating curve), accuracy, F1 score and recall were used to evaluate 
the predictive performance of each model. Shapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) 
values were calculated to evaluate feature importance of each feature.
RESULTS: Overall, there were 653 (24.8%) in-hospital mortality in the training 
cohort, and 523 (21.7%) in-hospital mortality in the validation cohort. Among 
the six machine learning models, the ensemble model achieved the best 
performance. The top 5 most influential features were the sequential organ 
failure assessment (SOFA) score, albumin, the oxford acute severity of illness 
score (OASIS) score, anion gap and bilirubin in random forest and XGBoost model. 
The SHAP summary plot was used to illustrate the positive or negative effects of 
the top 15 features attributed to the XGBoost model.
CONCLUSION: The ensemble model performed best and might be applied to forecast 
in-hospital mortality of critically ill lung cancer patients, and the SOFA score 
was the most important feature in all models. These results might offer valuable 
and significant reference for ICU clinicians' decision-making in advance.

Sepsis is a major health concern with global estimates of 31.5 million cases per 
year. Case fatality rates are still unacceptably high, and early detection and 
treatment is vital since it significantly reduces mortality rates for this 
condition. Appropriately designed automated detection tools have the potential 
to reduce the morbidity and mortality of sepsis by providing early and accurate 
identification of patients who are at risk of developing sepsis. In this paper, 
we present "LiSep LSTM"; a Long Short-Term Memory neural network designed for 
early identification of septic shock. LSTM networks are typically well-suited 
for detecting long-term dependencies in time series data. LiSep LSTM was 
developed using the machine learning framework Keras with a Google TensorFlow 
back end. The model was trained with data from the Medical Information Mart for 
Intensive Care database which contains vital signs, laboratory data, and journal 
entries from approximately 59,000 ICU patients. We show that LiSep LSTM can 
outperform a less complex model, using the same features and targets, with an 
AUROC 0.8306 (95% confidence interval: 0.8236, 0.8376) and median offsets 
between prediction and septic shock onset up to 40 hours (interquartile range, 
20 to 135 hours). Moreover, we discuss how our classifier performs at specific 
offsets before septic shock onset, and compare it with five state-of-the-art 
machine learning algorithms for early detection of sepsis.

BACKGROUND: The use of patient health and treatment information captured in 
structured and unstructured formats in computerized electronic health record 
(EHR) repositories could potentially augment the detection of safety signals for 
drug products regulated by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA). Natural 
language processing and other artificial intelligence (AI) techniques provide 
novel methodologies that could be leveraged to extract clinically useful 
information from EHR resources.
OBJECTIVE: Our aim is to develop a novel AI-enabled software prototype to 
identify adverse drug event (ADE) safety signals from free-text discharge 
summaries in EHRs to enhance opioid drug safety and research activities at the 
FDA.
METHODS: We developed a prototype for web-based software that leverages keyword 
and trigger-phrase searching with rule-based algorithms and deep learning to 
extract candidate ADEs for specific opioid drugs from discharge summaries in the 
Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care III (MIMIC III) database. The 
prototype uses MedSpacy components to identify relevant sections of discharge 
summaries and a pretrained natural language processing (NLP) model, Spark NLP 
for Healthcare, for named entity recognition. Fifteen FDA staff members provided 
feedback on the prototype's features and functionalities.
RESULTS: Using the prototype, we were able to identify known, labeled, 
opioid-related adverse drug reactions from text in EHRs. The AI-enabled model 
achieved accuracy, recall, precision, and F1-scores of 0.66, 0.69, 0.64, and 
0.67, respectively. FDA participants assessed the prototype as highly desirable 
in user satisfaction, visualizations, and in the potential to support drug 
safety signal detection for opioid drugs from EHR data while saving time and 
manual effort. Actionable design recommendations included (1) enlarging the tabs 
and visualizations; (2) enabling more flexibility and customizations to fit end 
users' individual needs; (3) providing additional instructional resources; (4) 
adding multiple graph export functionality; and (5) adding project summaries.
CONCLUSIONS: The novel prototype uses innovative AI-based techniques to automate 
searching for, extracting, and analyzing clinically useful information captured 
in unstructured text in EHRs. It increases efficiency in harnessing real-world 
data for opioid drug safety and increases the usability of the data to support 
regulatory review while decreasing the manual research burden.

Background Patients with chronic critical illness (CCI) experience poor 
prognoses and incur high medical costs. However, there is currently limited 
clinical awareness of sepsis-associated CCI, resulting in insufficient 
vigilance. Therefore, it is necessary to build a machine learning model that can 
predict whether sepsis patients will develop CCI. Methods Clinical data 
on 19,077 sepsis patients from the Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care 
IV (MIMIC-IV) database were analyzed. Predictive factors were identified using 
the Student's t-test, Mann-Whitney U test, or χ 2 test. Six machine learning 
classification models, namely, the logistic regression, support vector machine, 
decision tree, random forest, extreme gradient enhancement, and artificial 
neural network, were established. The optimal model was selected on the basis of 
its performance. Calibration curves were used to evaluate the accuracy of model 
classification, while the external validation dataset was used to evaluate the 
performance of the model. Results Thirty-seven characteristics, such as elevated 
alanine aminotransferase, rapid heart rate, and high Logistic Organ Dysfunction 
System scores, were identified as risk factors for developing CCI. The area 
under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUROC) values for all models 
were above 0.73 on the internal test set. Among them, the extreme gradient 
enhancement model exhibited superior performance (F1 score = 0.91, AUROC = 0.91, 
Brier score = 0.052). It also exhibited stable prediction performance on the 
external validation set (AUROC = 0.72). Conclusion A machine learning model was 
established to predict whether sepsis patients will develop CCI. It can provide 
useful predictive information for clinical decision-making.

BACKGROUND: Predictive models based on machine learning have been widely used in 
clinical practice. Patients with acute myocardial infarction (AMI) are prone to 
the risk of acute kidney injury (AKI), which results in a poor prognosis for the 
patient. The aim of this study was to develop a machine learning predictive 
model for the identification of AKI in AMI patients.
METHODS: Patients with AMI who had been registered in the Medical Information 
Mart for Intensive Care (MIMIC) III and IV database were enrolled. The primary 
outcome was the occurrence of AKI during hospitalization. We developed Random 
Forests (RF) model, Naive Bayes (NB) model, Support Vector Machine (SVM) model, 
eXtreme Gradient Boosting (xGBoost) model, Decision Trees (DT) model, and 
Logistic Regression (LR) models with AMI patients in MIMIC-IV database. The 
importance ranking of all variables was obtained by the SHapley Additive 
exPlanations (SHAP) method. AMI patients in MIMIC-III databases were used for 
model evaluation. The area under the receiver operating characteristic curve 
(AUC) was used to compare the performance of each model.
RESULTS: A total of 3,882 subjects with AMI were enrolled through screening of 
the MIMIC database, of which 1,098 patients (28.2%) developed AKI. We randomly 
assigned 70% of the patients in the MIMIC-IV data to the training cohort, which 
is used to develop models in the training cohort. The remaining 30% is allocated 
to the testing cohort. Meanwhile, MIMIC-III patient data performs the external 
validation function of the model. 3,882 patients and 37 predictors were included 
in the analysis for model construction. The top 5 predictors were serum 
creatinine, activated partial prothrombin time, blood glucose concentration, 
platelets, and atrial fibrillation, (SHAP values are 0.670, 0.444, 0.398, 0.389, 
and 0.381, respectively). In the testing cohort, using top 20 important 
features, the models of RF, NB, SVM, xGBoost, DT model, and LR obtained AUC of 
0.733, 0.739, 0.687, 0.689, 0.663, and 0.677, respectively. Placing RF models of 
number of different variables on the external validation cohort yielded their 
AUC of 0.711, 0.754, 0.778, 0.781, and 0.777, respectively.
CONCLUSION: Machine learning algorithms, particularly the random forest 
algorithm, have improved the accuracy of risk stratification for AKI in AMI 
patients and are applied to accurately identify the risk of AKI in AMI patients.

Blood glucose (BG) monitoring is important for critically ill patients, as poor 
sugar control has been associated with increased mortality in hospitalized 
patients. However, constant BG monitoring can be resource-intensive and pose a 
healthcare burden in clinical practice. In this study, we aimed to develop a 
personalized machine-learning model to predict dysglycemia from 
electrocardiogram (ECG) data. We used the Medical Information Mart for Intensive 
Care III database as our source of data and obtained more than 20 ECG records 
from each included patient during a single hospital admission. We focused on 
lead II recordings, along with corresponding blood sugar data. We processed the 
data and used ECG features from each heartbeat as inputs to develop a one-class 
support vector machine algorithm to predict dysglycemia. The model was able to 
predict dysglycemia using a single heartbeat with an AUC of 0.92 ± 0.09, a 
sensitivity of 0.92 ± 0.10, and specificity of 0.84 ± 0.04. After applying 10 s 
majority voting, the AUC of the model's dysglycemia prediction increased to 0.97 
± 0.06. This study showed that a personalized machine-learning algorithm can 
accurately detect dysglycemia from a single-lead ECG.

BACKGROUND: Acute kidney injury (AKI) can make cases of acute respiratory 
distress syndrome (ARDS) more complex, and the combination of the two can 
significantly worsen the prognosis. Our objective is to utilize machine learning 
(ML) techniques to construct models that can promptly identify the risk of AKI 
in ARDS patients.
METHOD: We obtained data regarding ARDS patients from the Medical Information 
Mart for Intensive Care III (MIMIC-III) and MIMIC-IV databases. Within the 
MIMIC-III dataset, we developed 11 ML prediction models. By evaluating various 
metrics, we visualized the importance of its features using Shapley additive 
explanations (SHAP). We then created a more concise model using fewer variables, 
and optimized it using hyperparameter optimization (HPO). The model was 
validated using the MIMIC-IV dataset.
RESULT: A total of 928 ARDS patients without AKI were included in the analysis 
from the MIMIC-III dataset, and among them, 179 (19.3%) developed AKI after 
admission to the intensive care unit (ICU). In the MIMIC-IV dataset, there were 
653 ARDS patients included in the analysis, and among them, 237 (36.3%) 
developed AKI. A total of 43 features were used to build the model. Among all 
models, eXtreme gradient boosting (XGBoost) performed the best. We used the top 
10 features to build a compact model with an area under the curve (AUC) of 
0.850, which improved to an AUC of 0.865 after the HPO. In extra validation set, 
XGBoost_HPO achieved an AUC of 0.854. The accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, 
positive prediction value (PPV), negative prediction value (NPV), and F1 score 
of the XGBoost_HPO model on the test set are 0.865, 0.813, 0.877, 0.578, 0.957 
and 0.675, respectively. On extra validation set, they are 0.724, 0.789, 0.688, 
0.590, 0.851, and 0.675, respectively.
CONCLUSION: ML algorithms, especially XGBoost, are reliable for predicting AKI 
in ARDS patients. The compact model maintains excellent predictive ability, and 
the web-based calculator improves clinical convenience. This provides valuable 
guidance in identifying AKI in ARDS, leading to improved patient outcomes.

We created an online calculator using machine learning (ML) algorithms to impute 
the partial pressure of oxygen (PaO2)/fraction of delivered oxygen (FiO2) ratio 
using the non-invasive peripheral saturation of oxygen (SpO2) and compared the 
accuracy of the ML models we developed to published equations. We generated 
three ML algorithms (neural network, regression, and kernel-based methods) using 
seven clinical variable features (N = 9900 ICU events) and subsequently three 
features (N = 20,198 ICU events) as input into the models. Data from 
mechanically ventilated ICU patients were obtained from the publicly available 
Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care (MIMIC III) database and used for 
analysis. Compared to seven features, three features (SpO2, FiO2 and PEEP) were 
sufficient to impute PaO2 from the SpO2. Any of the ML models enabled imputation 
of PaO2 from the SpO2 with lower error and showed greater accuracy in predicting 
PaO2/FiO2 ≤ 150 compared to the previously published log-linear and non-linear 
equations. To address potential hidden hypoxemia that occurs more frequently in 
Black patients, we conducted sensitivity analysis and show ML models 
outperformed published equations in both Black and White patients. Imputation 
using data from an independent validation cohort of ICU patients (N = 133) 
showed greater accuracy with ML models.

INTRODUCTION: Septic patients requiring intensive care unit (ICU) readmission 
are at high risk of mortality, but research focusing on the association of ICU 
readmission due to sepsis and mortality is limited. The aim of this study was to 
develop and validate a machine learning (ML) model for predicting in-hospital 
mortality in septic patients readmitted to the ICU using routinely available 
clinical data.
METHODS: The data used in this study were obtained from the Medical Information 
Mart for Intensive Care (MIMIC-IV, v1.0) database, between 2008 and 2019. The 
study cohort included patients with sepsis requiring ICU readmission. The data 
were randomly split into a training (75%) data set and a validation (25%) data 
set. Nine popular ML models were developed to predict mortality in septic 
patients readmitted to the ICU. The model with the best accuracy and area under 
the curve (A.C.) in the validation cohort was defined as the optimal model and 
was selected for further prediction studies. The SHAPELY Additive explanations 
(SHAP) values and Local Interpretable Model-Agnostic Explanation (LIME) methods 
were used to improve the interpretability of the optimal model.
RESULTS: A total of 1117 septic patients who had required ICU readmission during 
the study period were enrolled in the study. Of these participants, 434 (38.9%) 
were female, and the median (interquartile range [IQR]) age was 68.6 (58.4-79.2) 
years. The median (IQR) ICU interval duration was 2.60 (0.64-5.78) days. After 
feature selection, 31 of 47 clinical factors were ultimately chosen for use in 
model construction. Of the nine ML models tested, the best performance was 
achieved with the random forest (RF) model, with an A.C. of 0.81, an accuracy of 
85% and a precision of 62% in the validation cohort. The SHAP summary analysis 
revealed that Glasgow Coma Scale score, urine output, blood urea nitrogen, 
lactate, platelet count and systolic blood pressure were the top six most 
important factors contributing to the RF model. Additionally, the LIME method 
demonstrated how the RF model works in terms of explaining risk of death 
prediction in septic patients requiring ICU readmission.
CONCLUSION: The ML models reported here showed a good prognostic prediction 
ability in septic patients requiring ICU readmission. Of the features selected, 
the parameters related to organ perfusion made the largest contribution to 
outcome prediction during ICU readmission in septic patients.

BACKGROUND: Patients undergoing liver transplantation (LT) are at risk of 
perioperative neurocognitive dysfunction (PND), which significantly affects the 
patients' prognosis.
OBJECTIVE: This study used machine learning (ML) algorithms with an aim to 
extract critical predictors and develop an ML model to predict PND among LT 
recipients.
METHODS: In this retrospective study, data from 958 patients who underwent LT 
between January 2015 and January 2020 were extracted from the Third Affiliated 
Hospital of Sun Yat-sen University. Six ML algorithms were used to predict 
post-LT PND, and model performance was evaluated using area under the receiver 
operating curve (AUC), accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, and F1-scores. The 
best-performing model was additionally validated using a temporal external 
dataset including 309 LT cases from February 2020 to August 2022, and an 
independent external dataset extracted from the Medical Information Mart for 
Intensive Care Ⅳ (MIMIC-Ⅳ) database including 325 patients.
RESULTS: In the development cohort, 201 out of 751 (33.5%) patients were 
diagnosed with PND. The logistic regression model achieved the highest AUC 
(0.799) in the internal validation set, with comparable AUC in the temporal 
external (0.826) and MIMIC-Ⅳ validation sets (0.72). The top 3 features 
contributing to post-LT PND diagnosis were the preoperative overt hepatic 
encephalopathy, platelet level, and postoperative sequential organ failure 
assessment score, as revealed by the Shapley additive explanations method.
CONCLUSIONS: A real-time logistic regression model-based online predictor of 
post-LT PND was developed, providing a highly interoperable tool for use across 
medical institutions to support early risk stratification and decision making 
for the LT recipients.

This study aims to investigate the association between the triglyceride-glucose 
(TyG) index and the occurrence of acute respiratory failure in asthma patients. 
This retrospective observational cohort study utilized data from the Medical 
Information Mart for Intensive Care IV (MIMIC-IV 2.2) database. The primary 
outcome was the development of acute respiratory failure in asthma patients. 
Initially, the Boruta algorithm and SHapley Additive exPansions were applied to 
preliminarily determine the feature importance of the TyG index, and a risk 
prediction model was constructed to evaluate its predictive ability. Secondly, 
Logistic regression proportional hazards models were employed to assess the 
association between the TyG index and acute respiratory failure in asthma 
patients. Finally, subgroup analyses were conducted for sensitivity analyses to 
explore the robustness of the results. A total of 751 asthma patients were 
included in the study. When considering the TyG index as a continuous variable, 
logistic regression analysis revealed that in the unadjusted Model 1, the odds 
ratio (OR) was 2.381 (95% CI: 1.857-3.052; P < 0.001), in Model II, the OR was 
2.456 (95% CI: 1.809-3.335; P < 0.001), and in the multivariable-adjusted model, 
the OR was 1.444 (95% CI: 1.029-2.028; P = 0.034). A consistent association was 
observed between the TyG index and the risk of acute respiratory failure in 
asthma patients. No significant interaction was found between the TyG index and 
various subgroups (P > 0.05). Furthermore, machine learning results indicated 
that an elevated TyG index was a significant feature predictive of respiratory 
failure in asthma patients. The baseline risk model achieved an AUC of 0.743 
(95% CI: 0.679-0.808; P < 0.05), whereas the combination of the baseline risk 
model with the TyG index yielded an AUC of 0.757 (95% CI: 0.694-0.821; 
P < 0.05). The TyG index can serve as a predictive indicator for acute 
respiratory failure in asthma patients, albeit confirmation of these findings 
requires larger-scale prospective studies.

PURPOSE: Acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) is a serious respiratory 
condition with high mortality and associated morbidity. The objective of this 
study is to develop and evaluate a novel application of gradient boosted tree 
models trained on patient health record data for the early prediction of ARDS.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: 9919 patient encounters were retrospectively analyzed 
from the Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care III (MIMIC-III) data base. 
XGBoost gradient boosted tree models for early ARDS prediction were created 
using routinely collected clinical variables and numerical representations of 
radiology reports as inputs. XGBoost models were iteratively trained and 
validated using 10-fold cross validation.
RESULTS: On a hold-out test set, algorithm classifiers attained area under the 
receiver operating characteristic curve (AUROC) values of 0.905 when tested for 
the detection of ARDS at onset and 0.827, 0.810, and 0.790 for the prediction of 
ARDS at 12-, 24-, and 48-h windows prior to onset, respectively.
CONCLUSION: Supervised machine learning predictions may help predict patients 
with ARDS up to 48 h prior to onset.

BACKGROUND: Acute myocardial infarction (AMI) is one of the most severe 
cardiovascular diseases and is associated with a high risk of in-hospital 
mortality. However, the current deep learning models for in-hospital mortality 
prediction lack interpretability.
OBJECTIVE: This study aims to establish an explainable deep learning model to 
provide individualized in-hospital mortality prediction and risk factor 
assessment for patients with AMI.
METHODS: In this retrospective multicenter study, we used data for consecutive 
patients hospitalized with AMI from the Chongqing University Central Hospital 
between July 2016 and December 2022 and the Electronic Intensive Care Unit 
Collaborative Research Database. These patients were randomly divided into 
training (7668/10,955, 70%) and internal test (3287/10,955, 30%) data sets. In 
addition, data of patients with AMI from the Medical Information Mart for 
Intensive Care database were used for external validation. Deep learning models 
were used to predict in-hospital mortality in patients with AMI, and they were 
compared with linear and tree-based models. The Shapley Additive Explanations 
method was used to explain the model with the highest area under the receiver 
operating characteristic curve in both the internal test and external validation 
data sets to quantify and visualize the features that drive predictions.
RESULTS: A total of 10,955 patients with AMI who were admitted to Chongqing 
University Central Hospital or included in the Electronic Intensive Care Unit 
Collaborative Research Database were randomly divided into a training data set 
of 7668 (70%) patients and an internal test data set of 3287 (30%) patients. A 
total of 9355 patients from the Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care 
database were included for independent external validation. In-hospital 
mortality occurred in 8.74% (670/7668), 8.73% (287/3287), and 9.12% (853/9355) 
of the patients in the training, internal test, and external validation cohorts, 
respectively. The Self-Attention and Intersample Attention Transformer model 
performed best in both the internal test data set and the external validation 
data set among the 9 prediction models, with the highest area under the receiver 
operating characteristic curve of 0.86 (95% CI 0.84-0.88) and 0.85 (95% CI 
0.84-0.87), respectively. Older age, high heart rate, and low body temperature 
were the 3 most important predictors of increased mortality, according to the 
explanations of the Self-Attention and Intersample Attention Transformer model.
CONCLUSIONS: The explainable deep learning model that we developed could provide 
estimates of mortality and visual contribution of the features to the prediction 
for a patient with AMI. The explanations suggested that older age, unstable 
vital signs, and metabolic disorders may increase the risk of mortality in 
patients with AMI.

Automatic Medical Code Assignment via Deep Learning Approach for Intelligent 
Healthcare.

Teng F, Ma Z, Chen J, Xiao M, Huang L.

With the development of healthcare 4.0, there has been an explosion in the 
amount of data such as image, medical text, physiological signals, lab tests, 
etc. Among them, medical records provide a complete picture of the associated 
clinical events. However, the processing of medical texts is difficult because 
they are structurally free, diverse in style, and have subjective factors. 
Assigning metadata codes from the International Classification of Diseases (ICD) 
presents a standardized way of indicating diagnoses and procedures, so it 
becomes a mandatory process for understanding medical records to make better 
clinical and financial decisions. Such a manual encoding task is time-consuming, 
error-prone and expensive. In this paper, we proposed a deep learning approach 
and a medical topic mining method to automatically predict ICD codes from 
text-free medical records. The result of the F1 score on Medical Information 
Mart for Intensive Care (MIMIC-III) dataset increases by 5% over the state of 
art. It also suitable for multiple ICD versions and languages. For the specific 
disease, atrial fibrillation, the F1 score is up to 96% and 93.3% using in-house 
ICD-10 datasets and MIMIC-III datasets, respectively. We developed an Artificial 
Intelligence based coding system, which can greatly improve the efficiency and 
accuracy of human coders, and meanwhile accelerate the secondary use for 
clinical informatics.

South General Hospital), Stockholm, Sweden.

BACKGROUND: Acute kidney injury (AKI) represents a significant global health 
challenge, leading to increased patient distress and financial health care 
burdens. The development of AKI in intensive care unit (ICU) settings is linked 
to prolonged ICU stays, a heightened risk of long-term renal dysfunction, and 
elevated short- and long-term mortality rates. The current diagnostic approach 
for AKI is based on late indicators, such as elevated serum creatinine and 
decreased urine output, which can only detect AKI after renal injury has 
transpired. There are no treatments to reverse or restore renal function once 
AKI has developed, other than supportive care. Early prediction of AKI enables 
proactive management and may improve patient outcomes.
OBJECTIVE: The primary aim was to develop a machine learning algorithm, NAVOY 
Acute Kidney Injury, capable of predicting the onset of AKI in ICU patients 
using data routinely collected in ICU electronic health records. The ultimate 
goal was to create a clinical decision support tool that empowers ICU clinicians 
to proactively manage AKI and, consequently, enhance patient outcomes.
METHODS: We developed the NAVOY Acute Kidney Injury algorithm using a hybrid 
ensemble model, which combines the strengths of both a Random Forest (Leo 
Breiman and Adele Cutler) and an XGBoost model (Tianqi Chen). To ensure the 
accuracy of predictions, the algorithm used 22 clinical variables for hourly 
predictions of AKI as defined by the Kidney Disease: Improving Global Outcomes 
guidelines. Data for algorithm development were sourced from the Massachusetts 
Institute of Technology Lab for Computational Physiology Medical Information 
Mart for Intensive Care IV clinical database, focusing on ICU patients aged 18 
years or older.
RESULTS: The developed algorithm, NAVOY Acute Kidney Injury, uses 4 hours of 
input and can, with high accuracy, predict patients with a high risk of 
developing AKI 12 hours before onset. The prediction performance compares well 
with previously published prediction algorithms designed to predict AKI onset in 
accordance with Kidney Disease: Improving Global Outcomes diagnosis criteria, 
with an impressive area under the receiver operating characteristics curve 
(AUROC) of 0.91 and an area under the precision-recall curve (AUPRC) of 0.75. 
The algorithm's predictive performance was externally validated on an 
independent hold-out test data set, confirming its ability to predict AKI with 
exceptional accuracy.
CONCLUSIONS: NAVOY Acute Kidney Injury is an important development in the field 
of critical care medicine. It offers the ability to predict the onset of AKI 
with high accuracy using only 4 hours of data routinely collected in ICU 
electronic health records. This early detection capability has the potential to 
strengthen patient monitoring and management, ultimately leading to improved 
patient outcomes. Furthermore, NAVOY Acute Kidney Injury has been granted 
Conformite Europeenne (CE)-marking, marking a significant milestone as the first 
CE-marked AKI prediction algorithm for commercial use in European ICUs.

BACKGROUND: Postoperative pneumonia (POP) is one of the primary complications 
after aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage (aSAH) and is associated with 
postoperative mortality, extended hospital stay, and increased medical fee. 
Early identification of pneumonia and more aggressive treatment can improve 
patient outcomes. We aimed to develop a model to predict POP in aSAH patients 
using machine learning (ML) methods.
METHODS: This internal cohort study included 706 patients with aSAH undergoing 
intracranial aneurysm embolization or aneurysm clipping. The cohort was randomly 
split into a train set (80%) and a testing set (20%). Perioperative information 
was collected from participants to establish 6 machine learning models for 
predicting POP after surgical treatment. The area under the receiver operating 
characteristic curve (AUC), precision-recall curve were used to assess the 
accuracy, discriminative power, and clinical validity of the predictions. The 
final model was validated using an external validation set of 97 samples from 
the Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care IV (MIMIC-IV) database.
RESULTS: In this study, 15.01% of patients in the training set and 12.06% in the 
testing set with POP after underwent surgery. Multivariate logistic regression 
analysis showed that mechanical ventilation time (MVT), Glasgow Coma Scale 
(GCS), Smoking history, albumin level, neutrophil-to-albumin Ratio (NAR), 
c-reactive protein (CRP)-to-albumin ratio (CAR) were independent predictors of 
POP. The logistic regression (LR) model presented significantly better 
predictive performance (AUC: 0.91) than other models and also performed well in 
the external validation set (AUC: 0.89).
CONCLUSION: A machine learning model for predicting POP in aSAH patients was 
successfully developed using a machine learning algorithm based on six 
perioperative variables, which could guide high-risk POP patients to take 
appropriate preventive measures.

BACKGROUND: Early detection and efficient management of sepsis are important for 
improving health care quality, effectiveness, and costs. Due to its high cost 
and prevalence, sepsis is a major focus area across institutions and many 
studies have emerged over the past years with different models or novel machine 
learning techniques in early detection of sepsis or potential mortality 
associated with sepsis.
OBJECTIVE: To understand predictive analytics solutions for sepsis patients, 
either in early detection of onset or mortality.
METHODS AND RESULTS: We performed a systematized narrative review and identified 
common and unique characteristics between their approaches and results in 
studies that used predictive analytics solutions for sepsis patients. After 
reviewing 148 retrieved papers, a total of 31 qualifying papers were analyzed 
with variances in model, including linear regression (n = 2), logistic 
regression (n = 5), support vector machines (n = 4), and Markov models (n = 4), 
as well as population (range: 24-198,833) and feature size (range: 2-285). Many 
of the studies used local data sets of varying sizes and locations while others 
used the publicly available Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care data. 
Additionally, vital signs or laboratory test results were commonly used as 
features for training and testing purposes; however, a few used more unique 
features including gene expression data from blood plasma and unstructured text 
and data from clinician notes.
CONCLUSION: Overall, we found variation in the domain of predictive analytics 
tools for septic patients, from feature and population size to choice of method 
or algorithm. There are still limitations in transferability and 
generalizability of the algorithms or methods used. However, it is evident that 
implementing predictive analytics tools are beneficial in the early detection of 
sepsis or death related to sepsis. Since most of these studies were 
retrospective, the translational value in the real-world setting in different 
wards should be further investigated.

BACKGROUND: Sepsis-associated acute kidney injury (SA-AKI) is common in 
critically ill patients, which is associated with significantly increased 
mortality. Existing mortality prediction tools showed insufficient predictive 
power or failed to reflect patients' dynamic clinical evolution. Therefore, the 
study aimed to develop and validate machine learning-based models for real-time 
mortality prediction in critically ill patients with SA-AKI.
METHODS: The multi-center retrospective study included patients from two 
distinct databases. A total of 12,132 SA-AKI patients from the Medical 
Information Mart for Intensive Care IV (MIMIC-IV) were randomly allocated to the 
training, validation, and internal test sets. An additional 3,741 patients from 
the eICU Collaborative Research Database (eICU-CRD) served as an external test 
set. For every 12 h during the ICU stays, the state-of-the-art eXtreme Gradient 
Boosting (XGBoost) algorithm was used to predict the risk of in-hospital death 
in the following 48, 72, and 120 h and in the first 28 days after ICU admission. 
Area under the receiver operating characteristic curves (AUCs) were calculated 
to evaluate the models' performance.
RESULTS: The XGBoost models, based on routine clinical variables updated every 
12 h, showed better performance in mortality prediction than the SOFA score and 
SAPS-II. The AUCs of the XGBoost models for mortality over different time 
periods ranged from 0.848 to 0.804 in the internal test set and from 0.818 to 
0.748 in the external test set. The shapley additive explanation method provided 
interpretability for the XGBoost models, which improved the understanding of the 
association between the predictor variables and future mortality.
CONCLUSIONS: The interpretable machine learning XGBoost models showed promising 
performance in real-time mortality prediction in critically ill patients with 
SA-AKI, which are useful tools for early identification of high-risk patients 
and timely clinical interventions.

BACKGROUND: This study was performed to develop and validate machine learning 
models for early detection of ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) 24 h before 
diagnosis, so that VAP patients can receive early intervention and reduce the 
occurrence of complications.
PATIENTS AND METHODS: This study was based on the MIMIC-III dataset, which was a 
retrospective cohort. The random forest algorithm was applied to construct a 
base classifier, and the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve 
(AUC), sensitivity and specificity of the prediction model were evaluated. 
Furthermore, We also compare the performance of Clinical Pulmonary Infection 
Score (CPIS)-based model (threshold value ≥ 3) using the same training and test 
data sets.
RESULTS: In total, 38,515 ventilation sessions occurred in 61,532 ICU 
admissions. VAP occurred in 212 of these sessions. We incorporated 42 VAP risk 
factors at admission and routinely measured the vital characteristics and 
laboratory results. Five-fold cross-validation was performed to evaluate the 
model performance, and the model achieved an AUC of 84% in the validation, 74% 
sensitivity and 71% specificity 24 h after intubation. The AUC of our VAP 
machine learning model is nearly 25% higher than the CPIS model, and the 
sensitivity and specificity were also improved by almost 14% and 15%, 
respectively.
CONCLUSIONS: We developed and internally validated an automated model for VAP 
prediction using the MIMIC-III cohort. The VAP prediction model achieved high 
performance based on its AUC, sensitivity and specificity, and its performance 
was superior to that of the CPIS model. External validation and prospective 
interventional or outcome studies using this prediction model are envisioned as 
future work.

Acute kidney injury (AKI) is commonly present in critically ill patients with 
sepsis. Early prediction of short-term reversibility of AKI is beneficial to 
risk stratification and clinical treatment decision. The study sought to use 
machine learning methods to discriminate between transient and persistent 
sepsis-associated AKI. Septic patients who developed AKI within the first 48 h 
after ICU admission were identified from the Medical Information Mart for 
Intensive Care III database. AKI was classified as transient or persistent 
according to the Acute Disease Quality Initiative workgroup consensus. Five 
prediction models using logistic regression, random forest, support vector 
machine, artificial neural network and extreme gradient boosting were 
constructed, and their performance was evaluated by out-of-sample testing. A 
simplified risk prediction model was also derived based on logistic regression 
and features selected by machine learning algorithms. A total of 5984 septic 
patients with AKI were included, 3805 (63.6%) of whom developed persistent AKI. 
The artificial neural network and logistic regression models achieved the 
highest area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) among the 
five machine learning models (0.76, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.74-0.78). The 
simplified 14-variable model showed adequate discrimination, with the AUC being 
0.76 (95% CI 0.73-0.78). At the optimal cutoff of 0.63, the sensitivity and 
specificity of the simplified model were 63% and 76% respectively. In 
conclusion, a machine learning-based simplified prediction model including 
routine clinical variables could be used to differentiate between transient and 
persistent AKI in critically ill septic patients. An easy-to-use risk calculator 
can promote its widespread application in daily clinical practice.

BACKGROUND: This study applied machine learning (ML) algorithms to construct a 
model for predicting EN initiation for patients in the intensive care unit (ICU) 
and identifying populations in need of EN at an early stage.
METHODS: This study collected patient information from the Medical Information 
Mart for Intensive Care IV database. All patients enrolled were split randomly 
into a training set and a validation set. Six ML models were established to 
evaluate the initiation of EN, and the best model was determined according to 
the area under curve (AUC) and accuracy. The best model was interpreted using 
the Local Interpretable Model-Agnostic Explanations (LIME) algorithm and SHapley 
Additive exPlanation (SHAP) values.
RESULTS: A total of 53,150 patients participated in the study. They were divided 
into a training set (42,520, 80%) and a validation set (10,630, 20%). In the 
validation set, XGBoost had the optimal prediction performance with an AUC of 
0.895. The SHAP values revealed that sepsis, sequential organ failure assessment 
score, and acute kidney injury were the three most important factors affecting 
EN initiation. The individualized forecasts were displayed using the LIME 
algorithm.
CONCLUSION: The XGBoost model was established and validated for early prediction 
of EN initiation in ICU patients.

The escalating integration of machine learning in high-stakes fields such as 
healthcare raises substantial concerns about model fairness. We propose an 
interpretable framework, fairness-aware interpretable modeling (FAIM), to 
improve model fairness without compromising performance, featuring an 
interactive interface to identify a "fairer" model from a set of high-performing 
models and promoting the integration of data-driven evidence and clinical 
expertise to enhance contextualized fairness. We demonstrate FAIM's value in 
reducing intersectional biases arising from race and sex by predicting hospital 
admission with two real-world databases, the Medical Information Mart for 
Intensive Care IV Emergency Department (MIMIC-IV-ED) and the database collected 
from Singapore General Hospital Emergency Department (SGH-ED). For both 
datasets, FAIM models not only exhibit satisfactory discriminatory performance 
but also significantly mitigate biases as measured by well-established fairness 
metrics, outperforming commonly used bias mitigation methods. Our approach 
demonstrates the feasibility of improving fairness without sacrificing 
performance and provides a modeling mode that invites domain experts to engage, 
fostering a multidisciplinary effort toward tailored AI fairness.

BACKGROUND: There are many Machine Learning (ML) models which predict acute 
kidney injury (AKI) for hospitalised patients. While a primary goal of these 
models is to support clinical decision-making, the adoption of inconsistent 
methods of estimating baseline serum creatinine (sCr) may result in a poor 
understanding of these models' effectiveness in clinical practice. Until now, 
the performance of such models with different baselines has not been compared on 
a single dataset. Additionally, AKI prediction models are known to have a high 
rate of false positive (FP) events regardless of baseline methods. This warrants 
further exploration of FP events to provide insight into potential underlying 
reasons.
OBJECTIVE: The first aim of this study was to assess the variance in performance 
of ML models using three methods of baseline sCr on a retrospective dataset. The 
second aim was to conduct an error analysis to gain insight into the underlying 
factors contributing to FP events.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: The Intensive Care Unit (ICU) patients of the Medical 
Information Mart for Intensive Care (MIMIC)-IV dataset was used with the KDIGO 
(Kidney Disease Improving Global Outcome) definition to identify AKI episodes. 
Three different methods of estimating baseline sCr were defined as (1) the 
minimum sCr, (2) the Modification of Diet in Renal Disease (MDRD) equation and 
the minimum sCr and (3) the MDRD equation and the mean of preadmission sCr. For 
the first aim of this study, a suite of ML models was developed for each 
baseline and the performance of the models was assessed. An analysis of variance 
was performed to assess the significant difference between eXtreme Gradient 
Boosting (XGB) models across all baselines. To address the second aim, 
Explainable AI (XAI) methods were used to analyse the XGB errors with Baseline 
3.
RESULTS: Regarding the first aim, we observed variances in discriminative 
metrics and calibration errors of ML models when different baseline methods were 
adopted. Using Baseline 1 resulted in a 14% reduction in the f1 score for both 
Baseline 2 and Baseline 3. There was no significant difference observed in the 
results between Baseline 2 and Baseline 3. For the second aim, the FP cohort was 
analysed using the XAI methods which led to relabelling data with the mean of 
sCr in 180 to 0 days pre-ICU as the preferred sCr baseline method. The XGB model 
using this relabelled data achieved an AUC of 0.85, recall of 0.63, precision of 
0.54 and f1 score of 0.58. The cohort size was 31,586 admissions, of which 5,473 
(17.32%) had AKI.
CONCLUSION: In the absence of a widely accepted method of baseline sCr, AKI 
prediction studies need to consider the impact of different baseline methods on 
the effectiveness of ML models and their potential implications in real-world 
implementations. The utilisation of XAI methods can be effective in providing 
insight into the occurrence of prediction errors. This can potentially augment 
the success rate of ML implementation in routine care.

AIMS: Myocardial infarction and heart failure are major cardiovascular diseases 
that affect millions of people in the USA with morbidity and mortality being 
highest among patients who develop cardiogenic shock. Early recognition of 
cardiogenic shock allows prompt implementation of treatment measures. Our 
objective is to develop a new dynamic risk score, called CShock, to improve 
early detection of cardiogenic shock in the cardiac intensive care unit (ICU).
METHODS AND RESULTS: We developed and externally validated a deep learning-based 
risk stratification tool, called CShock, for patients admitted into the cardiac 
ICU with acute decompensated heart failure and/or myocardial infarction to 
predict the onset of cardiogenic shock. We prepared a cardiac ICU dataset using 
the Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care-III database by annotating with 
physician-adjudicated outcomes. This dataset which consisted of 1500 patients 
with 204 having cardiogenic/mixed shock was then used to train CShock. The 
features used to train the model for CShock included patient demographics, 
cardiac ICU admission diagnoses, routinely measured laboratory values and vital 
signs, and relevant features manually extracted from echocardiogram and left 
heart catheterization reports. We externally validated the risk model on the New 
York University (NYU) Langone Health cardiac ICU database which was also 
annotated with physician-adjudicated outcomes. The external validation cohort 
consisted of 131 patients with 25 patients experiencing cardiogenic/mixed shock. 
CShock achieved an area under the receiver operator characteristic curve (AUROC) 
of 0.821 (95% CI 0.792-0.850). CShock was externally validated in the more 
contemporary NYU cohort and achieved an AUROC of 0.800 (95% CI 0.717-0.884), 
demonstrating its generalizability in other cardiac ICUs. Having an elevated 
heart rate is most predictive of cardiogenic shock development based on Shapley 
values. The other top 10 predictors are having an admission diagnosis of 
myocardial infarction with ST-segment elevation, having an admission diagnosis 
of acute decompensated heart failure, Braden Scale, Glasgow Coma Scale, blood 
urea nitrogen, systolic blood pressure, serum chloride, serum sodium, and 
arterial blood pH.
CONCLUSION: The novel CShock score has the potential to provide automated 
detection and early warning for cardiogenic shock and improve the outcomes for 
millions of patients who suffer from myocardial infarction and heart failure.

OBJECTIVE: Early prediction of long-term outcomes in patients with systemic 
lupus erythematosus (SLE) remains a great challenge in clinical practice. Our 
study aims to develop and validate predictive models for the mortality risk.
METHODS: This observational study identified patients with SLE requiring 
hospital admission from the Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care 
(MIMIC-IV) database. We downloaded data from Fujian Provincial Hospital as an 
external validation set. Variable selection was performed using the Least 
Absolute Shrinkage and Selection Operator (LASSO) regression. Then, we 
constructed two predictive models: a traditional nomogram based on logistic 
regression and a machine learning model employing a stacking ensemble approach. 
The predictive ability of the models was evaluated by the areas under the 
receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) and the calibration curve.
RESULTS: A total of 395 patients and 100 patients were enrolled respectively 
from MIMIC-IV database and the validation cohort. The LASSO regression 
identified 18 significant variables. Both models demonstrated good 
discrimination, with AUCs above 0.8. The machine learning model outperformed the 
nomogram in terms of precision and specificity, highlighting its potential 
superiority in risk prediction. The SHapley additive explanations analysis 
further elucidated the contribution of each variable to the model's predictions, 
emphasising the importance of factors such as urine output, age, weight and 
alanine aminotransferase.
CONCLUSIONS: The machine learning model provides a superior tool for predicting 
mortality risk in patients with SLE, offering a basis for clinical 
decision-making and potential improvements in patient outcomes.

BACKGROUND: This study aimed to develop a higher performance nomogram based on 
explainable machine learning methods, and to predict the risk of death of stroke 
patients within 30 days based on clinical characteristics on the first day of 
intensive care units (ICU) admission.
METHODS: Data relating to stroke patients were extracted from the Medical 
Information Marketplace of the Intensive Care (MIMIC) IV and III database. The 
LightGBM machine learning approach together with Shapely additive explanations 
(termed as explain machine learning, EML) was used to select clinical features 
and define cut-off points for the selected features. These selected features and 
cut-off points were then evaluated using the Cox proportional hazards regression 
model and Kaplan-Meier survival curves. Finally, logistic regression-based 
nomograms for predicting 30-day mortality of stroke patients were constructed 
using original variables and variables dichotomized by cut-off points, 
respectively. The performance of two nomograms were evaluated in overall and 
individual dimension.
RESULTS: A total of 2982 stroke patients and 64 clinical features were included, 
and the 30-day mortality rate was 23.6% in the MIMIC-IV datasets. 10 variables 
("sofa (sepsis-related organ failure assessment)", "minimum glucose", "maximum 
sodium", "age", "mean spo2 (blood oxygen saturation)", "maximum temperature", 
"maximum heart rate", "minimum bun (blood urea nitrogen)", "minimum wbc (white 
blood cells)" and "charlson comorbidity index") and respective cut-off points 
were defined from the EML. In the Cox proportional hazards regression model (Cox 
regression) and Kaplan-Meier survival curves, after grouping stroke patients 
according to the cut-off point of each variable, patients belonging to the 
high-risk subgroup were associated with higher 30-day mortality than those in 
the low-risk subgroup. The evaluation of nomograms found that the EML-based 
nomogram not only outperformed the conventional nomogram in NIR (net 
reclassification index), brier score and clinical net benefits in overall 
dimension, but also significant improved in individual dimension especially for 
low "maximum temperature" patients.
CONCLUSIONS: The 10 selected first-day ICU admission clinical features require 
greater attention for stroke patients. And the nomogram based on explainable 
machine learning will have greater clinical application.

OBJECTIVE: To construct length of intensive care unit (ICU) stay (LOS-ICU) 
prediction models for ICU patients, based on three machine learning models 
support vector machine (SVM), classification and regression tree (CART), and 
random forest (RF), and to compare the prediction perfor-mance of the three 
machine learning models with the customized simplified acute physiology score 
Ⅱ(SAPS-Ⅱ) model.
METHODS: We used medical information mart for intensive care (MIMIC)-Ⅲ database 
for model development and validation. The primary outcome was prolonged 
LOS-ICU(pLOS-ICU), defined as longer than the third quartile of patients' 
LOS-ICU in the studied dataset. The recursive feature elimination method was 
used to do feature selection for three machine learning models. We utilized 
5-fold cross validation to evaluate model prediction performance. The Brier 
value, area under the receiver operation characteristic curve (AUROC), and 
estimated calibration index (ECI) were used as perfor-mance measures. 
Performances of the four models were compared, and performance differences 
between the models were assessed using two-sided t test. The model with the best 
prediction performance was employed to generate variable importance ranking, and 
the identified top five important predictors were pre-sented.
RESULTS: The final cohort in our study consisted of 40 200 eligible ICU 
patients, of whom 23.7% were with pLOS-ICU. The proportion of the male patients 
was 57.6%, and the age of all the ICU patients was (61.9±16.5) years.Results 
showed that the three machine learning models outperformed the customized SAPS-Ⅱ 
model in terms of all the performance measures with statistical significance (P 
< 0.01). Among the three machine learning models, the RF model achieved the best 
overall performance (Brier value, 0.145), discrimination (AUROC, 0.770) and 
calibration (ECI, 7.259). The calibration curve showed that the RF model 
slightly overestimated the risk of pLOS-ICU in high-risk ICU patients, but 
underestimated the risk of pLOS-ICU in low-risk ICU patients. Top five important 
predictors for pLOS-ICU identified by the RF model included age, heart rate, 
systolic blood pressure, body tempe-rature, and ratio of arterial oxygen tension 
to the fraction of inspired oxygen(PaO2/FiO2).
CONCLUSION: The RF algorithm-based pLOS-ICU prediction model had a best 
prediction performance in this study. It lays a foundation for future 
application of the RF-based pLOS-ICU prediction model in ICU clinical practice.

结果: 最终共纳入40 
200例ICU患者，发生pLOS-ICU的患者23.7%。其中，男性患者57.6%，患者平均年龄为(61.9±16.5)岁。五折交叉验证结果显示，相比于定制版SAPS-Ⅱ模型，三种机器学习模型的预测性能在各个指标上均有明显提升，且差异均具有统计学意义(P 
< 
0.01)。其中，RF模型在综合预测性能、区分度与校准度三个方面均表现最优，其Brier评分、AUROC和ECI分别为0.145、0.770和7.259。校准曲线结果显示，在高pLOS-ICU发生风险的ICU人群中，RF模型倾向于略微高估其风险；在低pLOS-ICU发生风险的ICU人群中，RF模型倾向于略微低估其风险。基于性能最优的RF模型识别的对pLOS-ICU预测最重要的五个变量依次为年龄、心率、收缩压、体温和动脉血氧分压与吸入氧分数之比。
结论: 
基于机器学习构建ICU患者的pLOS-ICU预测模型相比于传统的定制版SAPS-Ⅱ模型，预测性能均有明显提升，其中，基于RF方法的pLOS-ICU预测模型性能最优，具有很大的临床应用潜力。

Chronic heart failure (CHF) poses a significant threat to human health. The 
stress hyperglycemia ratio (SHR) is a novel metric for accurately assessing 
stress hyperglycemia, which has been correlated with adverse outcomes in various 
major diseases. However, it remains unclear whether SHR is associated with 
28-day mortality in patients with pre-existing CHF who were admitted to 
intensive care units (ICUs). This study retrospectively recruited patients who 
were admitted to ICUs with both acute critical illness and pre-existing CHF from 
the Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care (MIMIC) database. 
Characteristics were compared between the survival and non-survival groups. The 
relationship between SHR and 28-day all-cause mortality was analyzed using 
restricted cubic splines, receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves, 
Kaplan-Meier survival analysis, and Cox proportional hazards regression 
analysis. The importance of the potential risk factors was assessed using the 
Boruta algorithm. Prediction models were constructed using machine learning 
algorithms. A total of 913 patients were enrolled. The risk of 28-day mortality 
increased with higher SHR levels (P < 0.001). SHR was independently associated 
with 28-day all-cause mortality, with an unadjusted hazard ratio (HR) of 1.45 
(P < 0.001) and an adjusted HR of 1.43 (P < 0.001). Subgroup analysis found that 
none of the potential risk factors, such as demographics, comorbidities, and 
drugs, affected the relationship (P for interaction > 0.05). The area under the 
ROC (AUC) curve for SHR was larger than those for admission blood glucose and 
HbA1c; the cut-off for SHR was 0.57. Patients with SHR higher than the cut-off 
had a significantly lower 28-day survival probability (P < 0.001). SHR was 
identified as one of the key factors for 28-day mortality by the Boruta 
algorithm. The predictive performance was verified through four machine learning 
algorithms, with the neural network algorithm being the best (AUC 0.801). For 
patients with both acute critical illness and pre-existing CHF, SHR was an 
independent predictor of 28-day all-cause mortality. Its prognostic performance 
surpasses those of HbA1c and blood glucose, and prognostic models based on SHR 
provide clinicians with an effective tool to make therapeutic decisions.

BACKGROUND: Health providers create Electronic Health Records (EHRs) to describe 
the conditions and procedures used to treat their patients. Medical notes 
entered by medical staff in the form of free text are a particularly insightful 
component of EHRs. There is a great interest in applying machine learning tools 
on medical notes in numerous medical informatics applications. Learning vector 
representations, or embeddings, of terms in the notes, is an important 
pre-processing step in such applications. However, learning good embeddings is 
challenging because medical notes are rich in specialized terminology, and the 
number of available EHRs in practical applications is often very small.
METHODS: In this paper, we propose a novel algorithm to learn embeddings of 
medical terms from a limited set of medical notes. The algorithm, called 
definition2vec, exploits external information in the form of medical term 
definitions. It is an extension of a skip-gram algorithm that incorporates 
textual definitions of medical terms provided by the Unified Medical Language 
System (UMLS) Metathesaurus.
RESULTS: To evaluate the proposed approach, we used a publicly available Medical 
Information Mart for Intensive Care (MIMIC-III) EHR data set. We performed 
quantitative and qualitative experiments to measure the usefulness of the 
learned embeddings. The experimental results show that definition2vec keeps the 
semantically similar medical terms together in the embedding vector space even 
when they are rare or unobserved in the corpus. We also demonstrate that learned 
vector embeddings are helpful in downstream medical informatics applications.
CONCLUSION: This paper shows that medical term definitions can be helpful when 
learning embeddings of rare or previously unseen medical terms from a small 
corpus of specialized documents such as medical notes.

The construction sector in a rapidly developing country like India is a very 
unorganized sector. A large number of workers were affected and hospitalized 
during the pandemic. This situation is costing the sector heavily in several 
respects. This research study was conducted as part of using machine learning 
algorithms to improve construction company health and safety policies. LOS 
(length of stay) is used to predict how long a patient will stay in a hospital. 
Predicting LOS is very useful not only for hospitals, but also for construction 
companies to measure resources and reduce costs. Predicting LOS has become an 
important step in most hospitals before admitting patients. In this post, we 
used the Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care(MIMIC III) dataset and 
applied four different machine learning algorithms: decision tree classifier, 
random forest, Artificial Neural Network (ANN), and logistic regression. First, 
I performed data pre-processing to clean up the dataset. In the next step, we 
performed function selection using the Select Best algorithm with an evaluation 
function of chi2 to perform hot coding. We then performed a split between 
training and testing and applied a machine learning algorithm. The metric used 
for comparison was accuracy. After implementing the algorithms, the accuracy was 
compared. Random forest was found to perform best at 89%. Afterwards, we 
performed hyperparameter tuning using a grid search algorithm on a random forest 
to obtain higher accuracy. The final accuracy is 90%. This kind of research can 
help improve health security policies by introducing modern computational 
techniques, and can also help optimize resources.

BACKGROUND: Although cancer patients are increasingly admitted to the intensive 
care unit (ICU) for cancer- or treatment-related complications, improved 
mortality prediction remains a big challenge. This study describes a new 
ML-based mortality prediction model for critically ill cancer patients admitted 
to ICU.
PATIENTS AND METHODS: We developed CanICU, a machine learning-based 28-day 
mortality prediction model for adult cancer patients admitted to ICU from 
Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care (MIMIC) database in the USA (n = 
766), Yonsei Cancer Center (YCC, n = 3571), and Samsung Medical Center in Korea 
(SMC, n = 2563) from 2 January 2008 to 31 December 2017. The accuracy of CanICU 
was measured using sensitivity, specificity, and area under the receiver 
operating curve (AUROC).
RESULTS: A total of 6900 patients were included, with a 28-day mortality of 
10.2%/12.7%/36.6% and a 1-year mortality of 30.0%/36.6%/58.5% in the YCC, SMC, 
and MIMIC-III cohort. Nine clinical and laboratory factors were used to 
construct the classifier using a random forest machine-learning algorithm. 
CanICU had 96% sensitivity/73% specificity with the area under the receiver 
operating characteristic (AUROC) of 0.94 for 28-day, showing better performance 
than current prognostic models, including the Acute Physiology and Chronic 
Health Evaluation (APACHE) or Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (SOFA) score. 
Application of CanICU in two external data sets across the countries yielded 
79-89% sensitivity, 58-59% specificity, and 0.75-0.78 AUROC for 28-day 
mortality. The CanICU score was also correlated with one-year mortality with 
88-93% specificity.
CONCLUSION: CanICU offers improved performance for predicting mortality in 
critically ill cancer patients admitted to ICU. A user-friendly online 
implementation is available and should be valuable for better mortality risk 
stratification to allocate ICU care for cancer patients.

BACKGROUND: Predicting hospital mortality risk is essential for the care of 
heart failure patients, especially for those in intensive care units.
METHODS: Using a novel machine learning algorithm, we constructed a risk 
stratification tool that correlated patients' clinical features and in-hospital 
mortality. We used the extreme gradient boosting algorithm to generate a model 
predicting the mortality risk of heart failure patients in the intensive care 
unit in the derivation dataset of 5676 patients from the Medical Information 
Mart for Intensive Care III database. The logistic regression model and a common 
risk score for mortality were used for comparison. The eICU Collaborative 
Research Database dataset was used for external validation.
RESULTS: The performance of the machine learning model was superior to that of 
conventional risk predictive methods, with the area under curve 0.831 (95% CI 
0.820-0.843) and acceptable calibration. In external validation, the model had 
an area under the curve of 0.809 (95% CI 0.805-0.814). Risk stratification 
through the model was specific when the hospital mortality was very low, low, 
moderate, high, and very high (2.0%, 10.2%, 11.5%, 21.2% and 56.2%, 
respectively). The decision curve analysis verified that the machine learning 
model is the best clinically valuable in predicting mortality risk.
CONCLUSION: Using readily available clinical data in the intensive care unit, we 
built a machine learning-based mortality risk tool with prediction accuracy 
superior to that of linear regression model and common risk scores. The risk 
tool may support clinicians in assessing individual patients and making 
individualized treatment.

Objectives: This study aims to investigate whether the machine learning 
algorithms could provide an optimal early mortality prediction method compared 
with other scoring systems for patients with cerebral hemorrhage in intensive 
care units in clinical practice. Methods: Between 2008 and 2012, from Intensive 
Care III (MIMIC-III) database, all cerebral hemorrhage patients monitored with 
the MetaVision system and admitted to intensive care units were enrolled in this 
study. The calibration, discrimination, and risk classification of predicted 
hospital mortality based on machine learning algorithms were assessed. The 
primary outcome was hospital mortality. Model performance was assessed with 
accuracy and receiver operating characteristic curve analysis. Results: Of 760 
cerebral hemorrhage patients enrolled from MIMIC database [mean age, 68.2 years 
(SD, ±15.5)], 383 (50.4%) patients died in hospital, and 377 (49.6%) patients 
survived. The area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) of 
six machine learning algorithms was 0.600 (nearest neighbors), 0.617 (decision 
tree), 0.655 (neural net), 0.671(AdaBoost), 0.819 (random forest), and 0.725 
(gcForest). The AUC was 0.423 for Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation 
II score. The random forest had the highest specificity and accuracy, as well as 
the greatest AUC, showing the best ability to predict in-hospital mortality. 
Conclusions: Compared with conventional scoring system and the other five 
machine learning algorithms in this study, random forest algorithm had better 
performance in predicting in-hospital mortality for cerebral hemorrhage patients 
in intensive care units, and thus further research should be conducted on random 
forest algorithm.

PURPOSE: The detection of pleural effusion in chest radiography is crucial for 
doctors to make timely treatment decisions for patients with chronic obstructive 
pulmonary disease. We used the MIMIC-CXR database to develop a deep learning 
model to quantify pleural effusion severity in chest radiographs.
METHODS: The Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care Chest X-ray (MIMIC-CXR) 
dataset was divided into patients 'with' or 'without' chronic obstructive 
pulmonary disease (COPD). The label of pleural effusion severity was obtained 
from the extracted COPD radiology reports and classified into four categories: 
no effusion, small effusion, moderate effusion, and large effusion. A total of 
200 datasets were randomly sampled to manually check each item and determine 
whether the tags are correct. A professional doctor re-tagged these items as a 
verification cohort without knowing their previous tags. The learning models 
include eight common network structures including Resnet, DenseNet, and 
GoogleNET. Three data processing methods (no sampling, downsampling, and 
upsampling) and two loss algorithms (focal loss and cross-entropy loss) were 
used for unbalanced data. The Neural Network Intelligence tool was applied to 
train the model. Receiver operating characteristic curves, Area under the curve, 
and confusion matrix were employed to evaluate the model results. Grad-CAM was 
used for model interpretation.
RESULTS: Among the 8533 patients, 15,620 chest X-rays with clearly marked 
pleural effusion severity were obtained (no effusion, 5685; small effusion, 
4877; moderate effusion, 3657; and large effusion, 1401). The error rate of the 
manual check label was 6.5%, and the error rate of the doctor's relabeling was 
11.0%. The highest accuracy rate of the optimized model was 73.07. The 
micro-average AUCs of the testing and validation cohorts was 0.89 and 0.90, 
respectively, and their macro-average AUCs were 0.86 and 0.89, respectively. The 
AUC of the distinguishing results of each class and the other three classes were 
0.95 and 0.94, 0.76 and 0.83, 0.85 and 0.83, and 0.87 and 0.93.
CONCLUSION: The deep transfer learning model can grade the severity of pleural 
effusion.

BACKGROUND: Septic shock (SS) is a syndrome with high mortality. Early 
forewarning and diagnosis of SS, which are critical in reducing mortality, are 
still challenging in clinical management.
OBJECTIVE: We propose a simple and fast risk-stratified forewarning model for SS 
to help physicians recognize patients in time. Moreover, further insights can be 
gained from the application of the model to improve our understanding of SS.
METHODS: A total of 5125 patients with sepsis from the Medical Information Mart 
for Intensive Care-IV (MIMIC-IV) database were divided into training, 
validation, and test sets. In addition, 2180 patients with sepsis from the eICU 
Collaborative Research Database (eICU) were used as an external validation set. 
We developed a simplified risk-stratified early forewarning model for SS based 
on the weight of evidence and logistic regression, which was compared with 
multi-feature complex models, and clinical characteristics among risk groups 
were evaluated.
RESULTS: Using only vital signs and rapid arterial blood gas test features 
according to feature importance, we constructed the Septic Shock Risk Predictor 
(SORP), with an area under the curve (AUC) of 0.9458 in the test set, which is 
only slightly lower than that of the optimal multi-feature complex model 
(0.9651). A median forewarning time of 13 hours was calculated for SS patients. 
4 distinct risk groups (high, medium, low, and ultralow) were identified by the 
SORP 6 hours before onset, and the incidence rates of SS in the 4 risk groups in 
the postonset interval were 88.6% (433/489), 34.5% (262/760), 2.5% (67/2707), 
and 0.3% (4/1301), respectively. The severity increased significantly with 
increasing risk in both clinical features and survival. Clustering analysis 
demonstrated a high similarity of pathophysiological characteristics between the 
high-risk patients without SS diagnosis (NS_HR) and the SS patients, while a 
significantly worse overall survival was shown in NS_HR patients. On further 
exploring the characteristics of the treatment and comorbidities of the NS_HR 
group, these patients demonstrated a significantly higher incidence of mean 
blood pressure <65 mmHg, significantly lower vasopressor use and infused volume, 
and more severe renal dysfunction. The above findings were further validated by 
multicenter eICU data.
CONCLUSIONS: The SORP demonstrated accurate forewarning and a reliable risk 
stratification capability. Among patients forewarned as high risk, similar 
pathophysiological phenotypes and high mortality were observed in both those 
subsequently diagnosed as having SS and those without such a diagnosis. NS_HR 
patients, overlooked by the Sepsis-3 definition, may provide further insights 
into the pathophysiological processes of SS onset and help to complement its 
diagnosis and precise management. The importance of precise fluid resuscitation 
management in SS patients with renal dysfunction is further highlighted. For 
convenience, an online service for the SORP has been provided.

BACKGROUND: Sepsis-associated acute kidney injury (S-AKI) is a major contributor 
to mortality in intensive care units (ICU). Early prediction of mortality risk 
is crucial to enhance prognosis and optimize clinical decisions. This study aims 
to develop a 28-day mortality risk prediction model for S-AKI utilizing an 
explainable ensemble machine learning (ML) algorithm.
METHODS: This study utilized data from the Medical Information Mart for 
Intensive Care IV (MIMIC-IV 2.0) database to gather information on patients with 
S-AKI. Univariate regression, correlation analysis and Boruta were combined for 
feature selection. To construct the four ML models, hyperparameters were tuned 
via random search and five-fold cross-validation. To evaluate the performance of 
all models, ROC, K-S, and LIFT curves were used. The discrimination of ML models 
and traditional scoring systems was compared using area under the receiver 
operating characteristic curve (AUC). Additionally, the SHapley Additive 
exPlanation (SHAP) was utilized to interpret the ML model and identify essential 
variables. To investigate the relationship between the top nine continuous 
variables and the risk of 28-day mortality. COX regression-restricted cubic 
splines were utilized while controlling for age and comorbidities.
RESULTS: The study analyzed data from 9,158 patients with S-AKI, dividing them 
into a 28-day mortality group of 1,940 and a survival group of 7,578. The 
results showed that XGBoost was the best performing model of the four ML models 
with AUC of 0.873. All models outperformed APS-III 0.713 and SAPS-II 0.681. The 
K-S and LIFT curves indicated XGBoost as the most effective predictor for 28-day 
mortality risk. The model's performance was evaluated using ROCpr curves, 
calibration curves, accuracy, precision, and F1 scores. SHAP force plots were 
utilized to interpret and visualize the personalized predictive power of the 
28-day mortality risk model. Additionally, COX regression restricted cubic 
splines revealed an interesting non-linear relationship between the top nine 
variables and 28-day mortality.
CONCLUSION: The use of ensemble ML models has shown to be more effective than 
the LR model and conventional scoring systems in predicting 28-day mortality 
risk in S-AKI patients. By visualizing the XGBoost model with the best 
predictive performance, clinicians are able to identify high-risk patients early 
on and improve prognosis.

BACKGROUND: Intensive care unit (ICU) readmissions are associated with mortality 
and poor outcomes. To improve discharge decisions, machine learning (ML) could 
help to identify patients at risk of ICU readmission. However, as many models 
are black boxes, dangerous properties may remain unnoticed. Widely used post hoc 
explanation methods also have inherent limitations. Few studies are evaluating 
inherently interpretable ML models for health care and involve clinicians in 
inspecting the trained model.
METHODS: An inherently interpretable model for the prediction of 3 day ICU 
readmission was developed. We used explainable boosting machines that learn 
modular risk functions and which have already been shown to be suitable for the 
health care domain. We created a retrospective cohort of 15,589 ICU stays and 
169 variables collected between 2006 and 2019 from the University Hospital 
Münster. A team of physicians inspected the model, checked the plausibility of 
each risk function, and removed problematic ones. We collected qualitative 
feedback during this process and analyzed the reasons for removing risk 
functions. The performance of the final explainable boosting machine was 
compared with a validated clinical score and three commonly used ML models. 
External validation was performed on the widely used Medical Information Mart 
for Intensive Care version IV database.
RESULTS: The developed explainable boosting machine used 67 features and showed 
an area under the precision-recall curve of 0.119 ± 0.020 and an area under the 
receiver operating characteristic curve of 0.680 ± 0.025. It performed on par 
with state-of-the-art gradient boosting machines (0.123 ± 0.016, 0.665 ± 0.036) 
and outperformed the Simplified Acute Physiology Score II (0.084 ± 0.025, 0.607 
± 0.019), logistic regression (0.092 ± 0.026, 0.587 ± 0.016), and recurrent 
neural networks (0.095 ± 0.008, 0.594 ± 0.027). External validation confirmed 
that explainable boosting machines (0.221 ± 0.023, 0.760 ± 0.010) performed 
similarly to gradient boosting machines (0.232 ± 0.029, 0.772 ± 0.018). 
Evaluation of the model inspection showed that explainable boosting machines can 
be useful to detect and remove problematic risk functions.
CONCLUSIONS: We developed an inherently interpretable ML model for 3 day ICU 
readmission prediction that reached the state-of-the-art performance of black 
box models. Our results suggest that for low- to medium-dimensional datasets 
that are common in health care, it is feasible to develop ML models that allow a 
high level of human control without sacrificing performance.

As warfarin has a narrow therapeutic window and obvious response variability 
among individuals, it is difficult to rapidly determine personalized warfarin 
dosage. Adverse drug events(ADE) resulting from warfarin overdose can be 
critical, so that typically physicians adjust the warfarin dosage through the 
INR monitoring twice a week when starting warfarin. Our study aimed to develop 
machine learning (ML) models that predicts the discharge dosage of warfarin as 
the initial warfarin dosage using clinical data derived from electronic medical 
records within 2 days of hospitalization. During this retrospective study, adult 
patients who were prescribed warfarin at Asan Medical Center (AMC) between 
January 1, 2018, and October 31, 2020, were recruited as a model development 
cohort (n = 3168). Additionally, we created an external validation dataset (n = 
891) from a Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care III (MIMIC-III). 
Variables for a model prediction were selected based on the clinical rationale 
that turned out to be associated with warfarin dosage, such as bleeding. The 
discharge dosage of warfarin was used the study outcome, because we assumed that 
patients achieved target INR at discharge. In this study, four ML models that 
predicted the warfarin discharge dosage were developed. We evaluated the model 
performance using the mean absolute error (MAE) and prediction accuracy. 
Finally, we compared the accuracy of the predictions of our models and the 
predictions of physicians for 40 data point to verify a clinical relevance of 
the models. The MAEs obtained using the internal validation set were as follows: 
XGBoost, 0.9; artificial neural network, 0.9; random forest, 1.0; linear 
regression, 1.0; and physicians, 1.3. As a result, our models had better 
prediction accuracy than the physicians, who have difficulty determining the 
warfarin discharge dosage using clinical information obtained within 2 days of 
hospitalization. We not only conducted the internal validation but also external 
validation. In conclusion, our ML model could help physicians predict the 
warfarin discharge dosage as the initial warfarin dosage from Korean population. 
However, conducting a successfully external validation in a further work is 
required for the application of the models.

Sepsis-related mortality rates are high among elderly patients, especially those 
in intensive care units (ICUs). Early prediction of the prognosis of sepsis is 
critical, as prompt and effective treatment can improve prognosis. Researchers 
have predicted mortality and the development of sepsis using machine learning 
algorithms; however, few studies specifically focus on elderly patients with 
sepsis. This paper proposes a viable model for early prediction of in-hospital 
mortality among elderly patients diagnosed with sepsis. We extracted patient 
information from the Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care IV database. We 
employed several machine learning algorithms to predict the in-hospital 
mortality of elderly ICU patients with sepsis. The performance of the model was 
evaluated by using the AUROC and F1 score. Furthermore, the SHAP algorithm was 
used to explain the model, analyze how the individual features affect the model 
output, and visualize the Shapley value for a single individual. Our study 
included 18522 elderly patients, with a mortality of 15.4%. After screening, 59 
clinical variables were extracted to develop models. Feature importance analysis 
showed that age, PO2, RDW, SPO2, WBC, and urine output were significantly 
related to the in-hospital mortality. According to the results of AUROC (0.871 
(95% CI: 0.854-0.888)) and F1 score (0.547 (95% CI: 0.539-0.661)) analyses, the 
extreme gradient boosting (XGBoost) model outperformed the other models (i.e., 
LGBM, LR, RF, DT, and KNN). Furthermore, SHAP force analysis illustrated how the 
constructed model visualized the individualized prediction of death. XGBoost 
machine learning framework gives good in-hospital mortality prediction of 
elderly patients with sepsis and can maximize prediction model accuracy. The 
XGBoost model could be an effective tool to assist doctors in identifying 
high-risk cases of in-hospital mortality among elderly patients with sepsis. 
This could be used to create a clinical decision support system in the future.

OBJECTIVE: The Emergency Severity Index (ESI) is the most commonly used system 
in over 70% of all U.S. emergency departments (ED) that uses predicted resource 
utilization as a means to triage [1], Mistriage, which includes both undertriage 
and overtriage has been a persistent issue, affecting 32.2% of total ED visits 
[2]. Our goal is to develop a machine learning framework that predicts patients' 
resource needs, thereby improving resource allocation during triage.
METHODS: This retrospective study analyzed ED visits from the Medical 
Information Mart for Intensive Care IV, dividing the data into training (80%) 
and testing (20%) cohorts. We utilized data available during triage, including 
patient vital signs, age, gender, mode of arrival, medication history, and chief 
complaint. Azure AutoML was used to create different machine learning models 
trained to predict the 144 target columns including laboratory panels and 
imaging modalities as well as medications required during patients' ED visits. 
The 144 models' performance was evaluated using the area under the receiver 
operating characteristic curve (AUROC), F1 score, accuracy, precision and 
recall.
RESULTS: A total of 391,472 ED visits were analyzed. 144 Voting ensemble models 
were created for each target. All frameworks achieved on average an AUC score of 
0.82 and accuracy of 0.76. We gathered the feature importance for each target 
and observed that 'chief complaint', among others, had a high aggregate feature 
importance across different targets.
CONCLUSION: This study shows the high accuracy in predicting resource needs for 
patients in the ED using a machine learning model. This can greatly improve 
patient flow and resource allocation in already resource limited emergency 
departments.

BACKGROUND: Extubation is the process of removing tracheal tubes so that 
patients maintain oxygenation while they start to breathe spontaneously. 
However, hypoxemia after extubation is an important issue for critical care 
doctors and is associated with patients' oxygenation, circulation, recovery, and 
incidence of postoperative complications. Accuracy and specificity of most 
related conventional models remain unsatisfactory. We conducted a predictive 
analysis based on a supervised machine-learning algorithm for the precise 
prediction of hypoxemia after extubation in intensive care units (ICUs).
METHODS: Data were extracted from the Medical Information Mart for Intensive 
Care (MIMIC)-IV database for patients over age 18 who underwent mechanical 
ventilation in the ICU. The primary outcome was hypoxemia after extubation, and 
it was defined as a partial pressure of oxygen <60 mmHg after extubation. 
Variables and individuals with missing values greater than 20% were excluded, 
and the remaining missing values were filled in using multiple imputation. The 
dataset was split into a training set (80%) and final test set (20%). All 
related clinical and laboratory variables were extracted, and logistics stepwise 
regression was performed to screen out the key features. Six different advanced 
machine-learning models, including logistics regression (LOG), random forest 
(RF), K-nearest neighbors (KNN), support-vector machine (SVM), eXtreme Gradient 
Boosting (XGBoost), and Light Gradient Boosting Machine (LightGBM), were 
introduced for modelling. The best performance model in the first 
cross-validated dataset was further fine-tuned, and the final performance was 
assessed using the final test set.
RESULTS: A total of 14,777 patients were included in the study, and 1,864 of the 
patients' experienced hypoxemia after extubation. After training, the RF and 
LightGBM models were the strongest initial performers, and the area under the 
curve (AUC) using RF was 0.780 [95% confidence interval (CI), 0.755-0.805] and 
using LightGBM was 0.779 (95% CI, 0.752-0.806). The final AUC using RF was 0.792 
(95% CI, 0.771-0.814) and using LightGBM was 0.792 (95% CI, 0.770-0.815).
CONCLUSIONS: Our machine learning models have considerable potential for 
predicting hypoxemia after extubation, which help to reduce ICU morbidity and 
mortality.

BACKGROUND: Patients with heart failure (HF) with diabetes may face a poorer 
prognosis and higher mortality than patients with either disease alone, 
especially for those in intensive care unit. So far, there is no precise 
mortality risk prediction indicator for this kind of patient.
METHOD: Two high-quality critically ill databases, the Medical Information Mart 
for Intensive Care IV (MIMIC-IV) database and the Telehealth Intensive Care Unit 
(eICU) Collaborative Research Database (eICU-CRD) Collaborative Research 
Database, were used for study participants' screening as well as internal and 
external validation. Nine machine learning models were compared, and the best 
one was selected to define indicators associated with hospital mortality for 
patients with HF with diabetes. Existing attributes most related to hospital 
mortality were identified using a visualization method developed for machine 
learning, namely, Shapley Additive Explanations (SHAP) method. A new composite 
indicator ASL was established using logistics regression for patients with HF 
with diabetes based on major existing indicators. Then, the new index was 
compared with existing indicators to confirm its discrimination ability and 
clinical value using the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve, decision 
curve, and calibration curve.
RESULTS: The random forest model outperformed among nine models with the area 
under the ROC curve (AUC) = 0.92 after hyper-parameter optimization. By using 
this model, the top 20 attributes associated with hospital mortality in these 
patients were identified among all the attributes based on SHAP method. Acute 
Physiology Score (APS) III, Sepsis-related Organ Failure Assessment (SOFA), and 
Max lactate were selected as major attributes related to mortality risk, and a 
new composite indicator was developed by combining these three indicators, which 
was named as ASL. Both in the initial and external cohort, the new indicator, 
ASL, had greater risk discrimination ability with AUC higher than 0.80 in both 
low- and high-risk groups compared with existing attributes. The decision curve 
and calibration curve indicated that this indicator also had a respectable 
clinical value compared with APS III and SOFA. In addition, this indicator had a 
good risk stratification ability when the patients were divided into three risk 
levels.
CONCLUSION: A new composite indicator for predicting mortality risk in patients 
with HF with diabetes admitted to intensive care unit was developed on the basis 
of attributes identified by the random forest model. Compared with existing 
attributes such as APS III and SOFA, the new indicator had better discrimination 
ability and clinical value, which had potential value in reducing the mortality 
risk of these patients.

BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: Code assignment is of paramount importance in many 
levels in modern hospitals, from ensuring accurate billing process to creating a 
valid record of patient care history. However, the coding process is tedious and 
subjective, and it requires medical coders with extensive training. This study 
aims to evaluate the performance of deep-learning-based systems to automatically 
map clinical notes to ICD-9 medical codes.
METHODS: The evaluations of this research are focused on end-to-end learning 
methods without manually defined rules. Traditional machine learning algorithms, 
as well as state-of-the-art deep learning methods such as Recurrent Neural 
Networks and Convolution Neural Networks, were applied to the Medical 
Information Mart for Intensive Care (MIMIC-III) dataset. An extensive number of 
experiments was applied to different settings of the tested algorithm.
RESULTS: Findings showed that the deep learning-based methods outperformed other 
conventional machine learning methods. From our assessment, the best models 
could predict the top 10 ICD-9 codes with 0.6957 F1 and 0.8967 accuracy and 
could estimate the top 10 ICD-9 categories with 0.7233 F1 and 0.8588 accuracy. 
Our implementation also outperformed existing work under certain evaluation 
metrics.
CONCLUSION: A set of standard metrics was utilized in assessing the performance 
of ICD-9 code assignment on MIMIC-III dataset. All the developed evaluation 
tools and resources are available online, which can be used as a baseline for 
further research.

Sepsis-associated thrombocytopenia (SAT) is a common complication in the 
intensive care unit (ICU), which significantly increases the mortality rate and 
leads to poor prognosis of diseases. Machine learning (ML) is widely used in 
disease prediction in critically ill patients. Here, we aimed to establish 
prediction models for platelet decrease and severe platelet decrease in ICU 
patients with sepsis based on four common ML algorithms and identify the best 
prediction model. The research subjects were 1,455 ICU sepsis patients admitted 
to Dongyang People's Hospital affiliated with Wenzhou Medical University from 
January 1, 2015, to October 31, 2019. Basic clinical demographic information, 
biochemical indicators, and clinical outcomes were recorded. The prediction 
models were based on four ML algorithms: random forest, neural network, gradient 
boosting machine, and Bayesian algorithms. Thrombocytopenia was found to occur 
in 732 patients (49.7%). The mechanical ventilation time and length of ICU stay 
were longer, and the mortality rate was higher for the thrombocytopenia group 
than for the non-thrombocytopenia group. The models were validated on an online 
international database (Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care III). The 
areas under the receiver operating characteristic curves (AUCs) of the four 
models for the prediction of thrombocytopenia were between 0.54 and 0.72. The 
AUCs of the models for the prediction of severe thrombocytopenia were between 
0.70 and 0.77. The neural network and gradient boosting machine models 
effectively predicted the occurrence of SAT, and the Bayesian models had the 
best performance in predicting severe thrombocytopenia. Therefore, these models 
can be used to identify such high-risk patients at an early stage and guide 
individualized clinical treatment, to improve the prognosis of diseases.

INTRODUCTION: Comparing current to baseline serum creatinine is important in 
detecting acute kidney injury. In this study, we report a regression-based 
machine learning model to predict baseline serum creatinine.
METHODS: We developed and internally validated a gradient boosting model on 
patients admitted in Mayo Clinic intensive care units from 2005 to 2017 to 
predict baseline creatinine. The model was externally validated on the Medical 
Information Mart for Intensive Care III (MIMIC III) cohort in all ICU admissions 
from 2001 to 2012. The predicted baseline creatinine from the model was compared 
with measured serum creatinine levels. We compared the performance of our model 
with that of the backcalculated estimated serum creatinine from the Modification 
of Diet in Renal Disease (MDRD) equation.
RESULTS: Following ascertainment of eligibility criteria, 44,370 patients from 
the Mayo Clinic and 6,112 individuals from the MIMIC III cohort were enrolled. 
Our model used 6 features from the Mayo Clinic and MIMIC III datasets, including 
the presence of chronic kidney disease, weight, height, and age. Our model had 
significantly lower error than the MDRD backcalculation (mean absolute error 
[MAE] of 0.248 vs. 0.374 in the Mayo Clinic test data; MAE of 0.387 vs. 0.465 in 
the MIMIC III cohort) and higher correlation (intraclass correlation coefficient 
[ICC] of 0.559 vs. 0.050 in the Mayo Clinic test data; ICC of 0.357 vs. 0.030 in 
the MIMIC III cohort).
DISCUSSION/CONCLUSION: Using machine learning models, baseline serum creatinine 
could be estimated with higher accuracy than the backcalculated estimated serum 
creatinine level.

OBJECTIVES: This study aimed to develop and validate an easy-to-use intensive 
care unit (ICU) illness scoring system to evaluate the in-hospital mortality for 
very old patients (VOPs, over 80 years old).
METHODS: We performed a multicenter retrospective study based on the electronic 
ICU (eICU) Collaborative Research Database (eICU-CRD), Medical Information Mart 
for Intensive Care Database (MIMIC-III CareVue and MIMIC-IV), and the Amsterdam 
University Medical Centers Database (AmsterdamUMCdb). Least Absolute Shrinkage 
and Selection Operator regression was applied to variables selection. The 
logistic regression algorithm was used to develop the risk score and a nomogram 
was further generated to explain the score.
RESULTS: We analyzed 23 704 VOPs, including 3 726 deaths (10 183 [13.5% 
mortality] from eICU-CRD [development set], 12 703 [17.2%] from the MIMIC, and 
818 [20.8%] from the AmsterdamUMC [external validation sets]). Thirty-four 
variables were extracted on the first day of ICU admission, and 10 variables 
were finally chosen including Glasgow Coma Scale, shock index, respiratory rate, 
partial pressure of carbon dioxide, lactate, mechanical ventilation (yes vs no), 
oxygen saturation, Charlson Comorbidity Index, blood urea nitrogen, and urine 
output. The nomogram was developed based on the 10 variables (area under the 
receiver operating characteristic curve: training of 0.792, testing of 0.788, 
MIMIC of 0.764, and AmsterdamUMC of 0.808 [external validating]), which 
consistently outperformed the Sequential Organ Failure Assessment, acute 
physiology score III, and simplified acute physiology score II.
CONCLUSIONS: We developed and externally validated a nomogram for predicting 
mortality in VOPs based on 10 commonly measured variables on the first day of 
ICU admission. It could be a useful tool for clinicians to identify potentially 
high risks of VOPs.

BACKGROUND: Both in-hospital cardiac arrest (IHCA) and out-of-hospital cardiac 
arrest (OHCA) have higher incidence and lower survival rates. Predictors of 
in-hospital mortality for intensive care unit (ICU) admitted cardiac arrest (CA) 
patients remain unclear.
METHODS: The Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care IV (MIMIC-IV) database 
was used to perform a retrospective study. Patients meeting the inclusion 
criteria were identified from the MIMIC-IV database and randomly divided into 
training set (n = 1206, 70%) and validation set (n = 516, 30%). Candidate 
predictors consisted of the demographics, comorbidity, vital signs, laboratory 
test results, scoring systems, and treatment information on the first day of ICU 
admission. Independent risk factors for in-hospital mortality were screened 
using the least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) regression 
model and the extreme gradient boosting (XGBoost) in the training set. 
Multivariate logistic regression analysis was used to build prediction models in 
training set, and then validated in validation set. Discrimination, calibration 
and clinical utility of these models were compared using the area under the 
curve (AUC) of the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves, calibration 
curves and decision curve analysis (DCA). After pairwise comparison, the best 
performing model was chosen to build a nomogram.
RESULTS: Among the 1722 patients, in-hospital mortality was 53.95%. In both 
sets, the LASSO, XGBoost,the logistic regression(LR) model and the National 
Early Warning Score 2 (NEWS 2) models showed acceptable discrimination. In 
pairwise comparison, the prediction effectiveness was higher with the 
LASSO,XGBoost and LR models than the NEWS 2 model (p < 0.001). The LASSO,XGBoost 
and LR models also showed good calibration. The LASSO model was chosen as our 
final model for its higher net benefit and wider threshold range. And the LASSO 
model was presented as the nomogram.
CONCLUSIONS: The LASSO model enabled good prediction of in-hospital mortality in 
ICU admission CA patients, which may be widely used in clinical decision-making.

Cross-validation remains a popular means of developing and validating artificial 
intelligence for health care. Numerous subtypes of cross-validation exist. 
Although tutorials on this validation strategy have been published and some with 
applied examples, we present here a practical tutorial comparing multiple forms 
of cross-validation using a widely accessible, real-world electronic health care 
data set: Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care-III (MIMIC-III). This 
tutorial explored methods such as K-fold cross-validation and nested 
cross-validation, highlighting their advantages and disadvantages across 2 
common predictive modeling use cases: classification (mortality) and regression 
(length of stay). We aimed to provide readers with reproducible notebooks and 
best practices for modeling with electronic health care data. We also described 
sets of useful recommendations as we demonstrated that nested cross-validation 
reduces optimistic bias but comes with additional computational challenges. This 
tutorial might improve the community's understanding of these important methods 
while catalyzing the modeling community to apply these guides directly in their 
work using the published code.

Heterogeneous Multi-Task Learning With Expert Diversity.

Aoki R, Tung F, Oliveira GL.

Predicting multiple heterogeneous biological and medical targets is a challenge 
for traditional deep learning models. In contrast to single-task learning, in 
which a separate model is trained for each target, multi-task learning (MTL) 
optimizes a single model to predict multiple related targets simultaneously. To 
address this challenge, we propose the Multi-gate Mixture-of-Experts with 
Exclusivity (MMoEEx). Our work aims to tackle the heterogeneous MTL setting, in 
which the same model optimizes multiple tasks with different characteristics. 
Such a scenario can overwhelm current MTL approaches due to the challenges in 
balancing shared and task-specific representations and the need to optimize 
tasks with competing optimization paths. Our method makes two key contributions: 
first, we introduce an approach to induce more diversity among experts, thus 
creating representations more suitable for highly imbalanced and heterogenous 
MTL learning; second, we adopt a two-step optimization (Finn et al., 2017 and 
Lee et al., 2020) approach to balancing the tasks at the gradient level. We 
validate our method on three MTL benchmark datasets, including UCI-Census-income 
dataset, Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care (MIMIC-III) and PubChem 
BioAssay (PCBA).

This study aimed to develop models for predicting the 30-day mortality of 
sepsis-associated delirium (SAD) by multiple machine learning (ML) algorithms. 
On the whole, a cohort of 3,197 SAD patients were collected from the Medical 
Information Mart for Intensive Care (MIMIC)-IV database. Among them, a total of 
659 (20.61%) patients died following SAD. The patients who died were about 73.00 
(62.00, 82.00) years old and mostly male (56.75%). Recursive feature elimination 
(RFE) was used to distinguish risk factors. Subsequently, six ML algorithms 
including artificial neural network (NNET), gradient boosting machine (GBM), 
adaptive boosting (Ada), random forest (RF), eXtreme Gradient Boosting (XGB) and 
logistic regression (LR) were employed to establish models to predict the 30-day 
mortality of SAD. The performance of models was assessed via both discrimination 
and calibration by cross-validation with 100 resamples. Overall, 10 independent 
predictors, including Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS), Sequential Organ Failure 
Assessment (SOFA), anion gap (AG), continuous renal replacement therapy (CRRT), 
temperature, mean corpuscular hemoglobin concentration (MCHC), vasopressor, 
blood urea nitrogen (BUN), base excess (BE), and bicarbonate were identified as 
independent predictors for the 30-day mortality of SAD. The validation cohort 
demonstrated that all these six models had relatively favorable differentiation, 
while among them, the GBM model had the highest area under the curve (AUC) of 
0.845 (95% Confidence Interval (CI): 0.816, 0.874). Furthermore, the calibration 
curve of these six models was close to the diagonal line in the validation sets. 
As for decision curve analysis, the predictive models were clinically useful as 
well. Based on real-world research, we developed ML models to provide 
personalized predictions of delirium-related mortality in sepsis patients, 
potentially enabling clinicians to identify high-risk SAD patients more 
promptly.

BACKGROUND: Cardiac arrest (CA) is the leading cause of death in critically ill 
patients. Clinical research has shown that early identification of CA reduces 
mortality. Algorithms capable of predicting CA with high sensitivity have been 
developed using multivariate time series data. However, these algorithms suffer 
from a high rate of false alarms, and their results are not clinically 
interpretable.
OBJECTIVE: We propose an ensemble approach using multiresolution statistical 
features and cosine similarity-based features for the timely prediction of CA. 
Furthermore, this approach provides clinically interpretable results that can be 
adopted by clinicians.
METHODS: Patients were retrospectively analyzed using data from the Medical 
Information Mart for Intensive Care-IV database and the eICU Collaborative 
Research Database. Based on the multivariate vital signs of a 24-hour time 
window for adults diagnosed with heart failure, we extracted multiresolution 
statistical and cosine similarity-based features. These features were used to 
construct and develop gradient boosting decision trees. Therefore, we adopted 
cost-sensitive learning as a solution. Then, 10-fold cross-validation was 
performed to check the consistency of the model performance, and the Shapley 
additive explanation algorithm was used to capture the overall interpretability 
of the proposed model. Next, external validation using the eICU Collaborative 
Research Database was performed to check the generalization ability.
RESULTS: The proposed method yielded an overall area under the receiver 
operating characteristic curve (AUROC) of 0.86 and area under the 
precision-recall curve (AUPRC) of 0.58. In terms of the timely prediction of CA, 
the proposed model achieved an AUROC above 0.80 for predicting CA events up to 6 
hours in advance. The proposed method simultaneously improved precision and 
sensitivity to increase the AUPRC, which reduced the number of false alarms 
while maintaining high sensitivity. This result indicates that the predictive 
performance of the proposed model is superior to the performances of the models 
reported in previous studies. Next, we demonstrated the effect of feature 
importance on the clinical interpretability of the proposed method and inferred 
the effect between the non-CA and CA groups. Finally, external validation was 
performed using the eICU Collaborative Research Database, and an AUROC of 0.74 
and AUPRC of 0.44 were obtained in a general intensive care unit population.
CONCLUSIONS: The proposed framework can provide clinicians with more accurate CA 
prediction results and reduce false alarm rates through internal and external 
validation. In addition, clinically interpretable prediction results can 
facilitate clinician understanding. Furthermore, the similarity of vital sign 
changes can provide insights into temporal pattern changes in CA prediction in 
patients with heart failure-related diagnoses. Therefore, our system is 
sufficiently feasible for routine clinical use. In addition, regarding the 
proposed CA prediction system, a clinically mature application has been 
developed and verified in the future digital health field.

BACKGROUND: Intensive Care Unit (ICU) readmissions in patients with heart 
failure (HF) result in a significant risk of death and financial burden for 
patients and healthcare systems. Prediction of at-risk patients for readmission 
allows for targeted interventions that reduce morbidity and mortality.
METHODS AND RESULTS: We presented a process mining/deep learning approach for 
the prediction of unplanned 30-day readmission of ICU patients with HF. A 
patient's health records can be understood as a sequence of observations called 
event logs; used to discover a process model. Time information was extracted 
using the DREAM (Decay Replay Mining) algorithm. Demographic information and 
severity scores upon admission were then combined with the time information and 
fed to a neural network (NN) model to further enhance the prediction efficiency. 
Additionally, several machine learning (ML) algorithms were developed to be used 
as the baseline models for the comparison of the results.
RESULTS: By using the Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care III 
(MIMIC-III) dataset of 3411 ICU patients with HF, our proposed model yielded an 
area under the receiver operating characteristics (AUROC) of 0.930, 95% 
confidence interval of [0.898-0.960], the precision of 0.886, sensitivity of 
0.805, accuracy of 0.841, and F-score of 0.800 which were far better than the 
results of the best baseline model and the existing literature.
CONCLUSIONS: The proposed approach was capable of modeling the time-related 
variables and incorporating the medical history of patients from prior hospital 
visits for prediction. Thus, our approach significantly improved the outcome 
prediction compared to that of other ML-based models and health calculators.

INTRODUCTION: Few studies have investigated the in-hospital mortality among 
critically ill patients with hip fracture. This study aimed to develop and 
validate a model to estimate the risk of in-hospital mortality among critically 
ill patients with hip fracture.
METHODS: For this study, data from the Medical Information Mart for Intensive 
Care III (MIMIC-III) Database and electronic Intensive Care Unit (eICU) 
Collaborative Research Database were evaluated. Enrolled patients (n=391) in the 
MIMIC-III database were divided into a training (2/3, n=260) and a validation 
(1/3, n=131) group at random. Using machine learning algorithms such as random 
forest, gradient boosting machine, decision tree, and eXGBoosting machine 
approach, the training group was utilized to train and optimize models. The 
validation group was used to internally validate models and the optimal model 
could be obtained in terms of discrimination (area under the receiver operating 
characteristic curve, AUROC) and calibration (calibration curve). External 
validation was done in the eICU Collaborative Research Database (n=165). To 
encourage practical use of the model, a web-based calculator was developed 
according to the eXGBoosting machine approach.
RESULTS: The in-hospital death rate was 13.81% (54/391) in the MIMIC-III 
database and 10.91% (18/165) in the eICU Collaborative Research Database. Age, 
gender, anemia, mechanical ventilation, cardiac arrest, and chronic airway 
obstruction were the six model parameters which were identified using the Least 
Absolute Shrinkage and Selection Operator (LASSO) method combined with 10-fold 
cross-validation. The model established using the eXGBoosting machine approach 
showed the highest area under curve (AUC) value (0.797, 95% CI: 0.696-0.898) and 
the best calibrating ability, with a calibration slope of 0.999 and intercept of 
-0.019. External validation also revealed favorable discrimination (AUC: 0.715, 
95% CI: 0.566-0.864; accuracy: 0.788) and calibration (calibration slope: 0.805) 
in the eICU Collaborative Research Database. The web-based calculator could be 
available at https://doctorwangsj-webcalculator-main-yw69yd.streamlitapp.com/.
CONCLUSION: The model has the potential to be a pragmatic risk prediction tool 
that is able to identify hip fracture patients who are at a high risk of 
in-hospital mortality in ICU settings, guide patient risk counseling, and 
simplify prognosis bench-marking by controlling for baseline risk.

Electronic health records (EHRs) contain critical information useful for 
clinical studies. Early assessment of patients' mortality in intensive care 
units is of great importance. In this paper, a Deep Rule-Based Fuzzy System 
(DRBFS) was proposed to develop an accurate in-hospital mortality prediction in 
the intensive care unit (ICU) patients employing a large number of input 
variables. Our main contribution is proposing a system, which is capable of 
dealing with big data with heterogeneous mixed categorical and numeric 
attributes. In DRBFS, the hidden layer in each unit is represented by 
interpretable fuzzy rules. Benefiting the strength of soft partitioning, a 
modified supervised fuzzy k-prototype clustering has been employed for fuzzy 
rule generation. According to the stacked approach, the same input space is kept 
in every base building unit of DRBFS. The training set in addition to random 
shifts, obtained from random projections of prediction results of the current 
base building unit is presented as the input of the next base building unit. A 
cohort of 10,972 adult admissions was selected from Medical Information Mart for 
Intensive Care (MIMIC-III) data set, where 9.31% of patients have died in the 
hospital. A heterogeneous feature set of first 48 h from ICU admissions, were 
extracted for in-hospital mortality rate. Required preprocessing and appropriate 
feature extraction were applied. To avoid biased assessments, performance 
indexes were calculated using holdout validation. We have evaluated our proposed 
method with several common classifiers including naïve Bayes (NB), decision 
trees (DT), Gradient Boosting (GB), Deep Belief Networks (DBN) and D-TSK-FC. The 
area under the receiver operating characteristics curve (AUROC) for NB, DT, GB, 
DBN, D-TSK-FC and our proposed method were 73.51%, 61.81%, 72.98%, 70.07%, 
66.74% and 73.90% respectively. Our results have demonstrated that DRBFS 
outperforms various methods, while maintaining interpretable rule bases. 
Besides, benefiting from specific clustering methods, DRBFS can be well scaled 
up for large heterogeneous data sets.

OBJECTIVES: Recent advances in deep learning show significant potential in 
analyzing continuous monitoring electronic health records (EHR) data for 
clinical outcome prediction. We aim to develop a Transformer-based, 
Encounter-level Clinical Outcome (TECO) model to predict mortality in the 
intensive care unit (ICU) using inpatient EHR data.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: The TECO model was developed using multiple baseline and 
time-dependent clinical variables from 2579 hospitalized COVID-19 patients to 
predict ICU mortality and was validated externally in an acute respiratory 
distress syndrome cohort (n = 2799) and a sepsis cohort (n = 6622) from the 
Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care IV (MIMIC-IV). Model performance was 
evaluated based on the area under the receiver operating characteristic (AUC) 
and compared with Epic Deterioration Index (EDI), random forest (RF), and 
extreme gradient boosting (XGBoost).
RESULTS: In the COVID-19 development dataset, TECO achieved higher AUC 
(0.89-0.97) across various time intervals compared to EDI (0.86-0.95), RF 
(0.87-0.96), and XGBoost (0.88-0.96). In the 2 MIMIC testing datasets (EDI not 
available), TECO yielded higher AUC (0.65-0.77) than RF (0.59-0.75) and XGBoost 
(0.59-0.74). In addition, TECO was able to identify clinically interpretable 
features that were correlated with the outcome.
DISCUSSION: The TECO model outperformed proprietary metrics and conventional 
machine learning models in predicting ICU mortality among patients with 
COVID-19, widespread inflammation, respiratory illness, and other organ 
failures.
CONCLUSION: The TECO model demonstrates a strong capability for predicting ICU 
mortality using continuous monitoring data. While further validation is needed, 
TECO has the potential to serve as a powerful early warning tool across various 
diseases in inpatient settings.

predict ICU mortality, and was validated externally in an ARDS cohort (n=2799) 
and a sepsis cohort (n=6622) from the Medical Information Mart for Intensive 
Care (MIMIC)-IV. Model performance was evaluated based on area under the 
receiver operating characteristic (AUC) and compared with Epic Deterioration 
Index (EDI), random forest (RF), and extreme gradient boosting (XGBoost).
RESULTS: In the COVID-19 development dataset, TECO achieved higher AUC 
(0.89-0.97) across various time intervals compared to EDI (0.86-0.95), RF 
(0.87-0.96), and XGBoost (0.88-0.96). In the two MIMIC testing datasets (EDI not 
available), TECO yielded higher AUC (0.65-0.76) than RF (0.57-0.73) and XGBoost 
(0.57-0.73). In addition, TECO was able to identify clinically interpretable 
features that were correlated with the outcome.
DISCUSSION: TECO outperformed proprietary metrics and conventional machine 
learning models in predicting ICU mortality among COVID-19 and non-COVID-19 
patients.
CONCLUSIONS: TECO demonstrates a strong capability for predicting ICU mortality 
using continuous monitoring data. While further validation is needed, TECO has 
the potential to serve as a powerful early warning tool across various diseases 
in inpatient settings.

If a patient can be discharged from an intensive care unit (ICU) is usually 
decided by the treating physicians based on their clinical experience. However, 
nowadays limited capacities and growing socioeconomic burden of our health 
systems increase the pressure to discharge patients as early as possible, which 
may lead to higher readmission rates and potentially fatal consequences for the 
patients. Therefore, here we present a long short-term memory-based deep 
learning model (LSTM) trained on time series data from Medical Information Mart 
for Intensive Care (MIMIC-III) dataset to assist physicians in making decisions 
if patients can be safely discharged from cardiovascular ICUs. To underline the 
strengths of our LSTM we compare its performance with a logistic regression 
model, a random forest, extra trees, a feedforward neural network and with an 
already known, more complex LSTM as well as an LSTM combined with a 
convolutional neural network. The results of our evaluation show that our LSTM 
outperforms most of the above models in terms of area under receiver operating 
characteristic curve. Moreover, our LSTM shows the best performance with respect 
to the area under precision-recall curve. The deep learning solution presented 
in this article can help physicians decide on patient discharge from the ICU. 
This may not only help to increase the quality of patient care, but may also 
help to reduce costs and to optimize ICU resources. Further, the presented 
LSTM-based approach may help to improve existing and develop new medical machine 
learning prediction models.

AIMS: Hypokalemia is a common complication following traumatic brain injury, 
which may complicate treatment and lead to unfavorable outcomes. Identifying 
patients at risk of hypokalemia on the first day of admission helps to implement 
prophylactic treatment, reduce complications, and improve prognosis.
METHODS: This multicenter retrospective study was performed between January 2017 
and December 2020 using the electronic medical records of patients admitted due 
to traumatic brain injury. A propensity score matching approach was adopted with 
a ratio of 1:1 to overcome overfitting and data imbalance during subgroup 
analyses. Five machine learning algorithms were applied to generate a 
best-performed prediction model for in-hospital hypokalemia. The internal 
fivefold cross-validation and external validation were performed to demonstrate 
the interpretability and generalizability.
RESULTS: A total of 4445 TBI patients were recruited for analysis and model 
generation. Hypokalemia occurred in 46.55% of recruited patients and the 
incidences of mild, moderate, and severe hypokalemia were 32.06%, 12.69%, and 
1.80%, respectively. Hypokalemia was associated with increased mortality, while 
severe hypokalemia cast greater impacts. The logistic regression algorithm had 
the best performance in predicting decreased serum potassium and 
moderate-to-severe hypokalemia, with an AUC of 0.73 ± 0.011 and 0.74 ± 0.019, 
respectively. The prediction model was further verified using two external 
datasets, including our previous published data and the open-assessed Medical 
Information Mart for Intensive Care database. Linearized calibration curves 
showed no statistical difference (p > 0.05) with perfect predictions.
CONCLUSIONS: The occurrence of hypokalemia following traumatic brain injury can 
be predicted by first hospitalization day records and machine learning 
algorithms. The logistic regression algorithm showed an optimal predicting 
performance verified by both internal and external validation.

BACKGROUND: The prognosis of patients with alcohol-associated cirrhosis (ALC) 
admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) is poor. We developed and validated a 
nomogram (NIALC) for ICU patients with ALC.
METHODS: Predictors of mortality were defined by a machine learning method in a 
cohort of 394 ICU patients with ALC from the Medical Information Mart for 
Intensive Care database. Then the nomogram (NIALC) was constructed and evaluated 
using the AUC. The MELD, MELD-sodium, Child-Pugh, and CLIF-SOFA scores were then 
compared with NIALC. Two datasets of 394 and 501 ICU patients with ALC were 
utilized for model validation.
RESULTS: In-hospital mortality was 41% and 21% in the training and external 
validation sets. Predictors included were blood urea nitrogen, total bilirubin, 
prothrombin time, serum creatinine, lactate, partial thromboplastin time, 
phosphate, mean arterial pressure, lymphocytes, fibrinogen, and albumin. The 
AUCs for the NIALC were 0.767 and 0.760 in the two validation cohorts, which 
were better than those of the MELD, MELD-sodium, Child-Pugh, and CLIF-SOFA.
CONCLUSION: We developed a nomogram for ICU patients with ALC, which 
demonstrated better discriminative ability than previous prognostic scores. This 
nomogram could be conveniently used to facilitate the individualized prediction 
of death in ICU patients with ALC.

BACKGROUND: In the era of big data, the intensive care unit (ICU) is likely to 
benefit from real-time computer analysis and modeling based on close patient 
monitoring and electronic health record data. The Medical Information Mart for 
Intensive Care (MIMIC) is the first open access database in the ICU domain. Many 
studies have shown that common data models (CDMs) improve database searching by 
allowing code, tools, and experience to be shared. The Observational Medical 
Outcomes Partnership (OMOP) CDM is spreading all over the world.
OBJECTIVE: The objective was to transform MIMIC into an OMOP database and to 
evaluate the benefits of this transformation for analysts.
METHODS: We transformed MIMIC (version 1.4.21) into OMOP format (version 
5.3.3.1) through semantic and structural mapping. The structural mapping aimed 
at moving the MIMIC data into the right place in OMOP, with some data 
transformations. The mapping was divided into 3 phases: conception, 
implementation, and evaluation. The conceptual mapping aimed at aligning the 
MIMIC local terminologies to OMOP's standard ones. It consisted of 3 phases: 
integration, alignment, and evaluation. A documented, tested, versioned, 
exemplified, and open repository was set up to support the transformation and 
improvement of the MIMIC community's source code. The resulting data set was 
evaluated over a 48-hour datathon.
RESULTS: With an investment of 2 people for 500 hours, 64% of the data items of 
the 26 MIMIC tables were standardized into the OMOP CDM and 78% of the source 
concepts mapped to reference terminologies. The model proved its ability to 
support community contributions and was well received during the datathon, with 
160 participants and 15,000 requests executed with a maximum duration of 1 
minute.
CONCLUSIONS: The resulting MIMIC-OMOP data set is the first MIMIC-OMOP data set 
available free of charge with real disidentified data ready for replicable 
intensive care research. This approach can be generalized to any medical field.

BACKGROUND: Ventilator associated pneumonia (VAP) is a common complication and 
associated with poor prognosis of traumatic brain injury (TBI) patients.
OBJECTIVES: This study was conducted to explore the predictive performance of 
different machine-learning algorithms for VAP in TBI patients.
METHODS: TBI patients receiving mechanical ventilation more than 48 hours from 
the Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care-III (MIMIC-III) database were 
eligible for the study. The VAP was confirmed based on the ICD-9 code. Included 
patients were separated to the training cohort and the validation cohort with a 
ratio of 7:3. Predictive models based on different machine learning algorithms 
were developed using 5-fold cross validation in the training cohort and then 
verified in the validation cohort by evaluating the area under the receiver 
operating characteristic curve (AUC), sensitivity, specificity, accuracy and F 
score.
RESULTS: 786 TBI patients from the MIMIC-III were finally included with the VAP 
incidence of 44.0%. The random forest performed the best on predicting VAP in 
the training cohort with a AUC of 1.000. The XGBoost and AdaBoost were ranked 
the second and the third with a AUC of 0.915 and 0.789 in the training cohort. 
While the AdaBoost performed the best on predicting VAP in the validation cohort 
with a AUC of 0.706. The XGBoost and random forest were ranked the second and 
the third with the AUC of 0.685 and 0.683 in the validation cohort. Generally, 
the random forest and XGBoost were likely to be over-fitting while the AdaBoost 
was relatively stable in predicting the VAP.
CONCLUSIONS: The AdaBoost performed well and stably on predicting the VAP in TBI 
patients. Developing programs using AdaBoost in portable electronic devices may 
effectively assist physicians in assessing the risk of VAP in TBI.

BACKGROUND: Gastrointestinal bleeding (GIB) is a severe and potentially 
life-threatening complication in patients with acute myocardial infarction 
(AMI), significantly affecting prognosis during hospitalization. Early 
identification of high-risk patients is essential to reduce complications, 
improve outcomes, and guide clinical decision-making.
OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to develop and validate a machine learning 
(ML)-based model for predicting in-hospital GIB in patients with AMI, identify 
key risk factors, and evaluate the clinical applicability of the model for risk 
stratification and decision support.
METHODS: A multicenter retrospective cohort study was conducted, including 1910 
patients with AMI from the Affiliated Hospital of Guangdong Medical University 
(2005-2024). Patients were divided into training (n=1575) and testing (n=335) 
cohorts based on admission dates. For external validation, 1746 patients with 
AMI were included in the publicly available MIMIC-IV (Medical Information Mart 
for Intensive Care IV) database. Propensity score matching was adjusted for 
demographics, and the Boruta algorithm identified key predictors. A total of 7 
ML algorithms-logistic regression, k-nearest neighbors, support vector machine, 
decision tree, random forest (RF), extreme gradient boosting, and neural 
networks-were trained using 10-fold cross-validation. The models were evaluated 
for the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve, accuracy, 
sensitivity, specificity, recall, F1-score, and decision curve analysis. Shapley 
additive explanations analysis ranked variable importance. Kaplan-Meier survival 
analysis evaluated the impact of GIB on short-term survival. Multivariate 
logistic regression assessed the relationship between coronary heart disease 
(CHD) and in-hospital GIB after adjusting for clinical variables.
RESULTS: The RF model outperformed other ML models, achieving an area under the 
receiver operating characteristic curve of 0.77 in the training cohort, 0.77 in 
the testing cohort, and 0.75 in the validation cohort. Key predictors included 
red blood cell count, hemoglobin, maximal myoglobin, hematocrit, CHD, and other 
variables, all of which were strongly associated with GIB risk. Decision curve 
analysis demonstrated the clinical use of the RF model for early risk 
stratification. Kaplan-Meier survival analysis showed no significant differences 
in 7- and 15-day survival rates between patients with AMI with and without GIB 
(P=.83 for 7-day survival and P=.87 for 15-day survival). Multivariate logistic 
regression showed that CHD was an independent risk factor for in-hospital GIB 
(odds ratio 2.79, 95% CI 2.09-3.74). Stratified analyses by sex, age, 
occupation, marital status, and other subgroups consistently showed that the 
association between CHD and GIB remained robust across all subgroups.
CONCLUSIONS: The ML-based RF model provides a robust and clinically applicable 
tool for predicting in-hospital GIB in patients with AMI. By leveraging 
routinely available clinical and laboratory data, the model supports early risk 
stratification and personalized preventive strategies.

BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: Interpretable and real-time prediction of sepsis and 
risk factor analysis could enable timely treatment by clinicians and improve 
patient outcomes. To develop an interpretable machine-learning model for the 
prediction and risk factor analysis of sepsis and septic death.
METHODS: This is a retrospective observational cohort study based on the Medical 
Information Mart for Intensive Care (MIMIC-IV) dataset; 69,619 patients from the 
database were screened. The two outcomes include patients diagnosed with sepsis 
and the death of septic patients. Clinical variables from ICU admission to 
outcomes were analyzed: demographic data, vital signs, Glasgow Coma Scale 
scores, laboratory test results, and results for arterial blood gasses (ABGs). 
Model performance was compared using the area under the receiver operating 
characteristic curve (AUROC). Model interpretations were based on the Shapley 
additive explanations (SHAP), and the clustered analysis was based on the 
combination of K-means and dimensionality reduction algorithms of t-SNE and PCA.
RESULTS: For the analysis of sepsis and septic death, 47,185 and 2480 patients 
were enrolled, respectively. The XGBoost model achieved a predictive value of 
area under the curve (AUC): 0.745 [0.731-0.759] for sepsis prediction and 0.8 
[0.77, 0.828] for septic death prediction. The real-time prediction model was 
trained to predict by day and visualize the individual or combined risk factor 
effects on the outcomes based on SHAP values. Clustered analysis separated the 
two phenotypes with distinct risk factors among patients with septic death.
CONCLUSION: The proposed real-time, clustered prediction model for sepsis and 
septic death exhibited superior performance in predicting the outcomes and 
visualizing the risk factors in a real-time and interpretable manner to 
distinguish and mitigate patient risks, thus promising immense potential in 
effective clinical decision making and comprehensive understanding of complex 
diseases such as sepsis.

Deep learning models (aka Deep Neural Networks) have revolutionized many fields 
including computer vision, natural language processing, speech recognition, and 
is being increasingly used in clinical healthcare applications. However, few 
works exist which have benchmarked the performance of the deep learning models 
with respect to the state-of-the-art machine learning models and prognostic 
scoring systems on publicly available healthcare datasets. In this paper, we 
present the benchmarking results for several clinical prediction tasks such as 
mortality prediction, length of stay prediction, and ICD-9 code group prediction 
using Deep Learning models, ensemble of machine learning models (Super Learner 
algorithm), SAPS II and SOFA scores. We used the Medical Information Mart for 
Intensive Care III (MIMIC-III) (v1.4) publicly available dataset, which includes 
all patients admitted to an ICU at the Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center from 
2001 to 2012, for the benchmarking tasks. Our results show that deep learning 
models consistently outperform all the other approaches especially when the 
'raw' clinical time series data is used as input features to the models.

BACKGROUND: Ischemic stroke (IS) accounts large amount of stroke incidence. The 
aim of this study was to discover the risk and prognostic factors that affecting 
the occurrence of IS in hypertensive patients.
METHOD: Study data were obtained from the Medical Information Mart for Intensive 
Care (MIMIC)-IV database. To avoid biased factors selection process, several 
approaches were studied including logistic regression, elastic net regression, 
random forest, correlation analysis, and multifactor logistic regression 
methods. And seven different machine-learning methods are used to construct 
predictive models. The performance of the developed models was evaluated using 
AUC (Area Under the Curve), prediction accuracy, precision, recall, F1 score, 
PPV (Positive Predictive Value) and NPV (Negative Predictive Value). Interaction 
analysis was conducted to explore potential relationships between influential 
factors.
RESULTS: The study included 92,514 hypertensive patients, of which 1746 
hypertensive patients experienced IS. The Gradient Boosted Decision Tree (GBDT) 
model outperformed the other prediction model terms of prediction accuracy and 
AUC values in both ischemic and prognosis cases. By using the SHapley Additive 
exPlanations (SHAP), we found that a range of factors and corresponding 
interactions between factors are important risk factors for IS and its prognosis 
in hypertensive patients.
CONCLUSION: The study identified factors that increase the risk of IS and poor 
prognosis in hypertensive patients, which may provide guidance for clinical 
diagnosis and treatment.

INTRODUCTION: Although their importance has gained attention, the clinical 
applications of methods for screening patients at high risk of sepsis after 
abdominal surgery have been restricted. Therefore, we aimed to develop and 
validate models for screening patients at high risk of sepsis after abdominal 
surgery based on machine learning with routine variables.
MATERIAL AND METHODS: The whole dataset was composed of three representative 
academic hospitals in China and the Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care 
IV (MIMIC-IV) database. Routine clinical variables were implemented for model 
development. The Boruta algorithm was applied for feature selection. Afterwards, 
ensemble learning and eight other conventional algorithms were used for model 
fitting and validation based on all features and selected features. The area 
under the receiver operating characteristic curves (ROC AUC), sensitivity, 
specificity, F1 score, accuracy, net reclassification index (NRI), integrated 
discrimination improvement (IDI), decision curve analysis (DCA), and calibration 
curves were used for model evaluation.
RESULTS: A total of 955 patients undergoing abdominal surgery were finally 
analyzed (sepsis: 285, non-sepsis: 670). After feature selection, the ensemble 
learning model constructed by integrating k-Nearest Neighbor (KNN) and Support 
Vector Machine (SVM) yielded the ROC AUC of 0.892 (0.841-0.944) and accuracy of 
85.0% on the test data, and the ROC AUC of 0.782 (0.727-0.838) and accuracy of 
68.1% on the validation data, which performed best. Albumin, ASA score, 
neutrophil-lymphocyte ratio, age, and glucose were the top features associated 
with postoperative sepsis by KNN and SVM.
CONCLUSIONS: We developed a new and potential generalizable model to 
preoperatively screen patients at high risk of sepsis after abdominal surgery, 
with the advantages of a representative training cohort and routine variables.

Accurate prediction of patient-specific ventilator parameters is crucial for 
optimizing patient-ventilator interaction. Current approaches encounter 
difficulties in concurrently observing long-term, time-series dependencies and 
capturing complex, significant features that influence the ventilator treatment 
process, thereby hindering the achievement of accurate prediction of ventilator 
parameters. To address these challenges, we propose a novel approach called the 
long short-term memory relation network (LSTMRnet). Our approach uses a long, 
short-term memory bank to store rich information and an important feature 
selection step to extract relevant features related to respiratory parameters. 
This information is obtained from the prior knowledge of the follow up model. We 
also concatenate the embeddings of both information types to maintain the joint 
learning of spatio-temporal features. Our LSTMRnet effectively preserves both 
time-series and complex spatial-critical feature information, enabling an 
accurate prediction of ventilator parameters. We extensively validate our 
approach using the publicly available medical information mart for intensive 
care (MIMIC-III) dataset and achieve superior results, which can be potentially 
utilized for ventilator treatment (i.e., sleep apnea-hypopnea syndrome 
ventilator treatment and intensive care units ventilator treatment.

Introduction: Globally, hypertension (HT) is a substantial risk factor for 
cardiovascular disease and mortality; hence, rapid identification and treatment 
of HT is crucial. In this study, we tested the light gradient boosting machine 
(LightGBM) machine learning method for blood pressure stratification based on 
photoplethysmography (PPG), which is used in most wearable devices. Methods: We 
used 121 records of PPG and arterial blood pressure (ABP) signals from the 
Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care III public database. PPG, velocity 
plethysmography, and acceleration plethysmography were used to estimate blood 
pressure; the ABP signals were used to determine the blood pressure 
stratification categories. Seven feature sets were established and used to train 
the Optuna-tuned LightGBM model. Three trials compared normotension (NT) vs. 
prehypertension (PHT), NT vs. HT, and NT + PHT vs. HT. Results: The F1 scores 
for these three classification trials were 90.18%, 97.51%, and 92.77%, 
respectively. The results showed that combining multiple features from PPG and 
its derivative led to a more accurate classification of HT classes than using 
features from only the PPG signal. Discussion: The proposed method showed high 
accuracy in stratifying HT risks, providing a noninvasive, rapid, and robust 
method for the early detection of HT, with promising applications in the field 
of wearable cuffless blood pressure measurement.

OBJECTIVE: Critically ill patients with liver cirrhosis generally have a poor 
prognosis due to complications such as multiple organ failure. This study aims 
to develop a machine learning-based prediction model to forecast short-term 
mortality in critically ill cirrhotic patients in the intensive care unit (ICU), 
thereby assisting clinical decision-making for intervention and treatment.
METHODS: Machine learning models were developed using clinical data from 
critically ill cirrhotic patients in the MIMIC database, with multicenter 
validation performed using data from the eICU database and Qinghai University 
Affiliated Hospital(QUAH). Various machine learning models, including a Stacking 
ensemble model, were employed, with the SHAP method used to enhance model 
interpretability.
RESULTS: The Stacking ensemble model demonstrated superior predictive 
performance through internal and external validation, with AUC and AP values 
surpassing those of individual algorithms. The AUC values were 0.845 in the 
internal validation set, 0.819 in the eICU external validation, and 0.761 in the 
QUAH validation set. Additionally, the SHAP method highlighted key prognostic 
variables such as INR, bilirubin, and urine output. The model was ultimately 
deployed as a web-based calculator for bedside decision-making.
CONCLUSION: The machine learning model effectively predicts short-term mortality 
risk in critically ill cirrhotic patients in the ICU, showing strong predictive 
performance and generalizability. The model's robust interpretability and its 
deployment as a web-based calculator suggest its potential as a valuable tool 
for assessing the prognosis of cirrhotic patients.

BACKGROUND: Pulmonary embolism (PE) patients combined with heart failure (HF) 
have been reported to have a high short-term mortality. However, few studies 
have developed predictive tools of 30-day mortality for these patients in 
intensive care unit (ICU). This study aimed to construct and validate a machine 
learning (ML) model to predict 30-day mortality for PE patients combined with HF 
in ICU.
METHODS: We enrolled patients with PE combined with HF in the Medical 
Information Mart for Intensive Care Database (MIMIC) and developed six ML models 
after feature selection. Further, eICU Collaborative Research Database 
(eICU-CRD) was utilized for external vali- dation. The area under curves (AUC), 
calibration curves, decision curve analysis (DCA), net reclassification 
improvement (NRI), and integrated discrimination improvement (IDI) were 
performed to evaluate the prediction performance. Shapley additive explanation 
(SHAP) was performed to enhance the interpretability of our models.
RESULTS: A total of 472 PE patients combined with HF were included. We developed 
six ML models by the 13 selected features. After internal validation, the 
Support Vector Ma- chine (SVM) model performed best with an AUC of 0.835, a 
superior calibration degree, and a wider risk threshold (from 0% to 90%) for 
obtaining clinical benefit, which also outperformed traditional mortality risk 
evaluation systems,as evaluated by NRI and IDI. The SVM model was still reliable 
after external validation. SHAP was performed to explain the model. Moreover, an 
online application was developed for further clinical use.
CONCLUSION: This study developed a potential tool for identify short-term 
mortality risk to guide clinical decision making for PE patients combined with 
HF in the ICU. The SHAP method also helped clinicians to better understand the 
model.

OBJECTIVE: The growing availability of rich clinical data such as patients' 
electronic health records provide great opportunities to address a broad range 
of real-world questions in medicine. At the same time, artificial intelligence 
and machine learning (ML)-based approaches have shown great premise on 
extracting insights from those data and helping with various clinical problems. 
The goal of this study is to conduct a systematic comparative study of different 
ML algorithms for several predictive modeling problems in urgent care.
DESIGN: We assess the performance of 4 benchmark prediction tasks (eg mortality 
and prediction, differential diagnostics, and disease marker discovery) using 
medical histories, physiological time-series, and demographics data from the 
Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care (MIMIC-III) database.
MEASUREMENTS: For each given task, performance was estimated using standard 
measures including the area under the receiver operating characteristic (AUC) 
curve, F-1 score, sensitivity, and specificity. Microaveraged AUC was used for 
multiclass classification models.
RESULTS AND DISCUSSION: Our results suggest that recurrent neural networks show 
the most promise in mortality prediction where temporal patterns in physiologic 
features alone can capture in-hospital mortality risk (AUC > 0.90). Temporal 
models did not provide additional benefit compared to deep models in 
differential diagnostics. When comparing the training-testing behaviors of 
readmission and mortality models, we illustrate that readmission risk may be 
independent of patient stability at discharge. We also introduce a multiclass 
prediction scheme for length of stay which preserves sensitivity and AUC with 
outliers of increasing duration despite decrease in sample size.

BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: Patients who survive sepsis in the intensive care unit 
(ICU) (sepsis survivors) have an increased risk of long-term mortality and ICU 
readmission. We aim to identify the risk factors for in-hospital mortality in 
sepsis survivors with later ICU readmission and visualize the quantitative 
relationship between the individual risk factors and mortality by applying 
machine learning (ML) algorithm.
METHODS: Data were obtained from the Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care 
III (MIMIC-III) database for sepsis and non-sepsis ICU survivors who were later 
readmitted to the ICU. The data on the first day of ICU readmission and the 
in-hospital mortality was combined for the ML algorithm modeling and the SHapley 
Additive exPlanations (SHAP) value of the correlation between the risk factors 
and the outcome.
RESULTS: Among the 2970 enrolled patients, in-hospital mortality during ICU 
readmission was significantly higher in sepsis survivors (n = 2228) than 
nonsepsis survivors (n = 742) (50.4% versus 30.7%, P<0.001). The ML algorithm 
identified 18 features that were associated with a risk of mortality in these 
groups; among these, BUN, age, weight, and minimum heart rate were shared by 
both groups, and the remaining mean systolic pressure, urine output, albumin, 
platelets, lactate, activated partial thromboplastin time (APTT), potassium, 
pCO2, pO2, respiration rate, Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) score for eye-opening, 
anion gap, sex and temperature were specific to previous sepsis survivors. The 
ML algorithm also calculated the quantitative contribution and noteworthy 
threshold of each factor to the risk of mortality in sepsis survivors.
CONCLUSION: 14 specific parameters with corresponding thresholds were found to 
be associated with the in-hospital mortality of sepsis survivors during the ICU 
readmission. The construction of advanced ML techniques could support the 
analysis and development of predictive models that can be used to support the 
decisions and treatment strategies made in a clinical setting in critical care 
patients.

Arterial blood pressure (ABP) is an important vital sign from which it can be 
extracted valuable information about the subject's health. After studying its 
morphology it is possible to diagnose cardiovascular diseases such as 
hypertension, so ABP routine control is recommended. The most common method of 
controlling ABP is the cuff-based method, from which it is obtained only the 
systolic and diastolic blood pressure (SBP and DBP, respectively). This paper 
proposes a cuff-free method to estimate the morphology of the average ABP pulse 
(ABPM¯) through a deep learning model based on a seq2seq architecture with 
attention mechanism. It only needs raw photoplethysmogram signals (PPG) from the 
finger and includes the capacity to integrate both categorical and continuous 
demographic information (DI). The experiments were performed on more than 1100 
subjects from the MIMIC database for which their corresponding age and gender 
were consulted. Without allowing the use of data from the same subjects to train 
and test, the mean absolute errors (MAE) were 6.57 ± 0.20 and 14.39 ± 0.42 mmHg 
for DBP and SBP, respectively. For ABPM¯, R correlation coefficient and the MAE 
were 0.98 ± 0.001 and 8.89 ± 0.10 mmHg. In summary, this methodology is capable 
of transforming PPG into an ABP pulse, which obtains better results when DI of 
the subjects is used, potentially useful in times when wireless devices are 
becoming more popular.

Patients with multiple comorbidities and those undergoing complex cardiac 
surgery may experience extubation failure and reintubation. The aim of this 
study was to establish an extubation prediction model using explainable machine 
learning and identify the most important predictors of extubation failure in 
patients undergoing cardiac surgery. Data from 776 adult patients who underwent 
cardiac surgery and were intubated for more than 24 h were obtained from the 
Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care (MIMIC)-IV database. The primary 
endpoint was extubation failure according to the WIND criteria, with 205 
patients experiencing extubation failure. The data was split into a training set 
(80%) and a test set (20%). The performance of the XGBoost algorithm was the 
highest (AUC 0.793, Mean Precision 0.700, Brier Score0.150), which was better 
than that of logistic regression (AUC 0.766, Mean Precision 0.553, Brier 
Score0.173) and random forest (AUC 0.791, Mean Precision 0.510, Brier Score 
0.181). The most crucial predictor of extubation failure is the mean value of 
the anion gap in the 24 h before extubation. The other main features include 
ventilator parameters and blood gas indicators. By applying machine learning to 
large datasets, we developed a new method for predicting extubation failure 
after cardiac surgery in critically ill patients. Based on the predictive 
factors analyzed, internal environmental indicators and ventilation 
characteristics were important predictors of extubation failure. Therefore, 
these predictive factors should be considered when determining extubation 
readiness.

BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: Traumatic Brain Injury (TBI) is one of the leading 
causes of injury-related mortality in the world, with severe cases reaching 
mortality rates of 30-40%. It is highly heterogeneous both in causes and 
consequences making more complex the medical interpretation and prognosis. 
Gathering clinical, demographic, and laboratory data to perform a prognosis 
requires time and skill in several clinical specialties. Artificial intelligence 
(AI) methods can take advantage of existing data by performing helpful 
predictions and guiding physicians toward a better prognosis and, consequently, 
better healthcare. The objective of this work was to develop learning models and 
evaluate their capability of predicting the mortality of TBI. The predictive 
model would allow the early assessment of the more serious cases and scarce 
medical resources can be pointed toward the patients who need them most.
METHODS: Long Short Term Memory (LSTM) and Transformer architectures were tested 
and compared in performance, coupled with data imbalance, missing data, and 
feature selection strategies. From the Medical Information Mart for Intensive 
Care III (MIMIC-III) dataset, a cohort of TBI patients was selected and an 
analysis of the first 48 hours of multiple time series sequential variables was 
done to predict hospital mortality.
RESULTS: The best performance was obtained with the Transformer architecture, 
achieving an AUC of 0.907 with the larger group of features and trained with 
class proportion class weights and binary cross entropy loss.
CONCLUSIONS: Using the time series sequential data, LSTM and Transformers proved 
to be both viable options for predicting TBI hospital mortality in 48 hours 
after admission. Overall, using sequential deep learning models with time series 
data to predict TBI mortality is viable and can be used as a helpful indicator 
of the well-being of patients.

BACKGROUND: Abdominal perfusion pressure (APP) is a salient feature in the 
design of a prognostic model for patients with intra-abdominal hypertension 
(IAH). However, incomplete data significantly limits the size of the beneficiary 
patient population in clinical practice. Using advanced artificial intelligence 
methods, the authors developed a robust mortality prediction model with APP from 
incomplete data.
METHODS: The authors retrospectively evaluated the patients with IAH from the 
Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care IV (MIMIC-IV) database. Incomplete 
data were filled in using generative adversarial imputation nets (GAIN). Lastly, 
demographic, clinical, and laboratory findings were combined to build a 7-day 
mortality prediction model.
RESULTS: The authors included 1354 patients in this study, of which 63 features 
were extracted. Data imputation with GAIN achieved the best performance. 
Patients with an APP <60 mmHg had significantly higher all-cause mortality 
within 7-90 days. The difference remained significant in long-term survival even 
after propensity score matching (PSM) eliminated other mortality risks between 
groups. Lastly, the built machine learning model for 7-day modality prediction 
achieved the best results with an AUC of 0.80 in patients with confirmed IAH 
outperforming the other four traditional clinical scoring systems.
CONCLUSIONS: APP reduction is an important survival predictor affecting the 
survival prognosis of patients with IAH. The authors constructed a robust model 
to predict the 7-day mortality probability of patients with IAH, which is 
superior to the commonly used clinical scoring systems.

OBJECTIVE: To develop machine learning models for predicting intensive care unit 
(ICU) readmission using ensemble learning algorithms.
METHODS: A publicly accessible American ICU database, medical information mart 
for intensive care (MIMIC)-Ⅲ as the data source was used, and the patients were 
selected by the inclusion and exclusion criteria. A set of variables that had 
the predictive ability of outcome including demographics, vital signs, 
laboratory tests, and comorbidities of patients were extracted from the dataset. 
We built the ICU readmission prediction models based on ensemble learning 
methods including random forest, adaptive boosting (AdaBoost), and gradient 
boosting decision tree (GBDT), and compared the prediction performance of the 
machine learning models with a conventional Logistic regression model. Five-fold 
cross validation was used to train and validate the prediction models. Average 
sensitivity, positive prediction value, negative prediction value, false 
positive rate, false negative rate, area under the receiver operating 
characteristic curve (AUROC) and Brier score were used as performance measures. 
After constructing the prediction models, top 10 predictive variables based on 
importance ranking were identified by the model with the best discrimination.
RESULTS: Among these ICU readmission prediction models, GBDT (AUROC=0.858) had 
better performance than random forest (AUROC=0.827), and was slightly superior 
to AdaBoost (AUROC=0.851) in terms of AUROC. Compared with Logistic regression 
(AUROC=0.810), the discrimination of the three ensemble learning models was much 
better. The feature importance provided by GBDT showed that the top ranking 
variables included vital signs and laboratory tests. The patients with ICU 
readmission had higher mean arterial pressure, systolic blood pressure, 
diastolic blood pressure, and heart rate than the patients without ICU 
readmission. Meanwhile, the patients readmitted to ICU experienced lower urine 
output and higher serum creatinine. Overall, the patients having repeated 
admissions during their hospitalization showed worse heart function and renal 
function compared with the patients without ICU readmission.
CONCLUSION: The ensemble learning based ICU readmission prediction models had 
better performance than Logistic regression model. Such ensemble learning models 
have the potential to aid ICU physicians in identifying those patients with high 
risk of ICU readmission and thus help improve overall clinical outcomes.

目的: 基于集成学习算法建立患者再入重症监护病房(intensive care unit, ICU)的风险预测模型，并比较各个模型的预测性能。
方法: 使用美国重症医学数据库(medical information mart for intensive 
care，MIMIC)-Ⅲ，根据纳入、排除标准筛选患者，提取人口学特征、生命体征、实验室检查、合并症等可能对结局有预测作用的变量，基于集成学习方法随机森林、自适应提升算法(adaptive 
boosting, AdaBoost)和梯度提升决策树(gradient boosting decision tree, 
GBDT)建立再入ICU预测模型，并比较集成学习与Logistic回归的预测性能。使用五折交叉验证后的平均灵敏度、阳性预测值、阴性预测值、假阳性率、假阴性率、受试者工作特征曲线下面积(area 
under the receiver operating characteristic 
curve，AUROC)和Brier评分评价模型效果，基于最佳性能模型给出重要性排序前10位的预测变量。
结果: 所有模型中，GBDT (AUROC=0.858)优于随机森林(AUROC=0.827)，略好于AdaBoost 
(AUROC=0.851)。与Logistic回归(AUROC=0.810)相比，集成学习算法在区分度上均有较大的提升。GBDT算法给出的变量重要性排序中，平均动脉压、收缩压、舒张压、心率、尿量、血肌酐等变量排序靠前，相对而言，再入ICU患者的心血管功能和肾功能更差。
结论: 
基于集成学习算法的患者再入ICU预测模型表现出较好的性能，优于Logistic回归。使用集成学习算法建立的再入ICU风险预测模型可用于识别再入ICU风险高的患者，医务人员可针对高风险患者采取干预措施，改善患者的整体临床结局。

OBJECTIVE: Bacterial infections (BIs) are common, costly, and potentially 
life-threatening in critically ill patients. Patients with suspected BIs may 
require empiric multidrug antibiotic regimens and therefore potentially be 
exposed to prolonged and unnecessary antibiotics. We previously developed a BI 
risk model to augment practices and help shorten the duration of unnecessary 
antibiotics to improve patient outcomes. Here, we have performed a 
transportability assessment of this BI risk model in 2 tertiary intensive care 
unit (ICU) settings and a community ICU setting. We additionally explored how 
simple multisite learning techniques impacted model transportability.
METHODS: Patients suspected of having a community-acquired BI were identified in 
3 datasets: Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care III (MIMIC), 
Northwestern Medicine Tertiary (NM-T) ICUs, and NM "community-based" ICUs. ICU 
encounters from MIMIC and NM-T datasets were split into 70/30 train and test 
sets. Models developed on training data were evaluated against the NM-T and 
MIMIC test sets, as well as NM community validation data.
RESULTS: During internal validations, models achieved AUROCs of 0.78 (MIMIC) and 
0.81 (NM-T) and were well calibrated. In the external community ICU validation, 
the NM-T model had robust transportability (AUROC 0.81) while the MIMIC model 
transported less favorably (AUROC 0.74), likely due to case-mix differences. 
Multisite learning provided no significant discrimination benefit in internal 
validation studies but offered more stability during transport across all 
evaluation datasets.
DISCUSSION: These results suggest that our BI risk models maintain predictive 
utility when transported to external cohorts.
CONCLUSION: Our findings highlight the importance of performing external model 
validation on myriad clinically relevant populations prior to implementation.

Early warning prediction of traumatic hemorrhagic shock (THS) can greatly reduce 
patient mortality and morbidity. We aimed to develop and validate models with 
different stepped feature sets to predict THS in advance. From the PLA General 
Hospital Emergency Rescue Database and Medical Information Mart for Intensive 
Care III, we identified 604 and 1,614 patients, respectively. Two popular 
machine learning algorithms (i.e., extreme gradient boosting [XGBoost] and 
logistic regression) were applied. The area under the receiver operating 
characteristic curve (AUROC) was used to evaluate the performance of the models. 
By analyzing the feature importance based on XGBoost, we found that features in 
vital signs (VS), routine blood (RB), and blood gas analysis (BG) were the most 
relevant to THS (0.292, 0.249, and 0.225, respectively). Thus, the stepped 
relationships existing in them were revealed. Furthermore, the three stepped 
feature sets (i.e., VS, VS + RB, and VS + RB + sBG) were passed to the two 
machine learning algorithms to predict THS in the subsequent T hours (where 
T = 3, 2, 1, or 0.5), respectively. Results showed that the XGBoost model 
performance was significantly better than the logistic regression. The model 
using vital signs alone achieved good performance at the half-hour time window 
(AUROC = 0.935), and the performance was increased when laboratory results were 
added, especially when the time window was 1 h (AUROC = 0.950 and 0.968, 
respectively). These good-performing interpretable models demonstrated 
acceptable generalization ability in external validation, which could flexibly 
and rollingly predict THS T hours (where T = 0.5, 1) prior to clinical 
recognition. A prospective study is necessary to determine the clinical utility 
of the proposed THS prediction models.

OBJECTIVE: Cellulitis is the most common cause of skin-related hospitalisations, 
and the mortality of patients with sepsis remains high. Some stratification 
models have been developed, but their performance in external validation has 
been unsatisfactory. This study was designed to develop and compare different 
models for predicting patients with cellulitis developing sepsis during 
hospitalisation.
DESIGN: This is a retrospective cohort study.
SETTING: This study included both the development and the external-validation 
phases from two independent large cohorts internationally.
PARTICIPANTS AND METHODS: A total of 6695 patients with cellulitis in the 
Medical Information Mart for Intensive care (MIMIC)-IV database were used to 
develop models with different machine-learning algorithms. The best models were 
selected and then externally validated in 2506 patients with cellulitis from the 
YiduCloud database of our university. The performances and robustness of 
selected models were further compared in the external-validation group by area 
under the curve (AUC), diagnostic accuracy, sensitivity, specificity and 
diagnostic OR.
PRIMARY OUTCOME MEASURES: The primary outcome of interest in this study was the 
development based on the Sepsis-3.0 criteria during hospitalisation.
RESULTS: Patient characteristics were significantly different between the two 
groups. In internal validation, XGBoost was the best model, with an AUC of 
0.780, and AdaBoost was the worst model, with an AUC of 0.585. In external 
validation, the AUC of the artificial neural network (ANN) model was the 
highest, 0.830, while the AUC of the logistic regression (LR) model was the 
lowest, 0.792. The AUC values changed less in the boosting and ANN models than 
in the LR model when variables were deleted.
CONCLUSIONS: Boosting and neural network models performed slightly better than 
the LR model and were more robust in complex clinical situations. The results 
could provide a tool for clinicians to detect hospitalised patients with 
cellulitis developing sepsis early.

BACKGROUND: The application of sepsis subtypes to enhance personalized medicine 
in critically ill patients is hindered by the lack of validation across diverse 
cohorts and the absence of a simple classification model. We aimed to validate 
the previously identified SENECA clinical sepsis subtypes in multiple large ICU 
cohorts, and to develop parsimonious classifier models for δ-type adjudication 
in clinical practice.
METHODS: Data from four cohorts between 2008 and 2023 were used to assign α, β, 
γ and δ-type in patients fulfilling the Sepsis-3 criteria using clinical 
variables: (I) The Molecular diAgnosis and Risk stratification of Sepsis (MARS, 
n = 2449), (II) a contemporary continuation of the MARS study (MARS2, n = 2445) 
(III) the Dutch National Intensive Care Evaluation registry (NICE, n = 28,621) 
and (IV) the Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care including (MIMIC-IV, 
n = 18,661). K-means clustering using clinical variables was conducted to assess 
the optimal number of classes and compared to the SENECA subtypes. Parsimonious 
models were built in the SENECA derivation cohort to predict subtype membership 
using logistic regression, and validated in MARS and MIMIC-IV.
RESULTS: Among 52.226 patients with sepsis, the subtype distribution in MARS, 
MARS2 and NICE was 2-6% for the α-type, 1-5% for the β-type, 49-65% for the 
γ-type and 26-48% for the δ-type compared to 33%, 27%, 27% and 13% in the 
original SENECA derivation cohort, whereas subtype distribution in MIMIC-IV was 
more similar at 25%, 24%, 27% and 25%, respectively. In-hospital mortality rates 
were significantly different between the four cohorts for α, γ and δ-type 
(p < 0.001). Method-based validation showed moderate overlap with the original 
subtypes in both MARS and MIMIC-IV. A parsimonious model for all four subtypes 
had moderate to low accuracy (accuracy 62.2%), while a parsimonious classifier 
model with 3 variables (aspartate aminotransferase, serum lactate, and 
bicarbonate) had excellent accuracy in predicting the δ-type patients from all 
other types in the derivation cohort and moderate accuracy in the validation 
cohorts (MARS: area under the receiver operator characteristic curve (AUC) 0.93, 
95% CI [0.92-0.94], accuracy 85.5% [84.0-86.8%]; MIMIC-IV: AUC 0.86 [0.85-0.87], 
accuracy 82.9% [82.4-83.4%]).
CONCLUSIONS: The distribution and mortality rates of clinical sepsis subtypes 
varied between US and European cohorts. A three-variable model could accurately 
identify the δ-type sepsis patients.

BACKGROUND: The lack of automated tools for measuring care quality limits the 
implementation of a national program to assess guideline-directed care in heart 
failure with reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF).
OBJECTIVES: The authors aimed to automate the identification of patients with 
HFrEF at hospital discharge, an opportunity to evaluate and improve the quality 
of care.
METHODS: The authors developed a novel deep-learning language model for 
identifying patients with HFrEF from discharge summaries of hospitalizations 
with heart failure at Yale New Haven Hospital during 2015 to 2019. HFrEF was 
defined by left ventricular ejection fraction <40% on antecedent 
echocardiography. The authors externally validated the model at Northwestern 
Medicine, community hospitals of Yale, and the MIMIC-III (Medical Information 
Mart for Intensive Care III) database.
RESULTS: A total of 13,251 notes from 5,392 unique individuals (age 73 ± 14 
years, 48% women), including 2,487 patients with HFrEF (46.1%), were used for 
model development (train/held-out: 70%/30%). The model achieved an area under 
receiver-operating characteristic curve (AUROC) of 0.97 and area under precision 
recall curve (AUPRC) of 0.97 in detecting HFrEF on the held-out set. The model 
had high performance in identifying HFrEF with AUROC = 0.94 and AUPRC = 0.91 on 
19,242 notes from Northwestern Medicine, AUROC = 0.95 and AUPRC = 0.96 on 139 
manually abstracted notes from Yale community hospitals, and AUROC = 0.91 and 
AUPRC = 0.92 on 146 manually reviewed notes from MIMIC-III. Model-based 
predictions of HFrEF corresponded to a net reclassification improvement of 60.2% 
± 1.9% compared with diagnosis codes (P < 0.001).
CONCLUSIONS: The authors developed a language model that identifies HFrEF from 
clinical notes with high precision and accuracy, representing a key element in 
automating quality assessment for individuals with HFrEF.

Temporal-Spatial Correlation Attention Network for Clinical Data Analysis in 
Intensive Care Unit.

Nie W, Yu Y, Zhang C, Song D, Zhao L, Bai Y.

Recent advancements in medical information technology have enabled electronic 
health records (EHRs) to store comprehensive clinical data which has ushered 
healthcare into the era of "big data". However, medical data are rather 
complicated, making problem-solving in healthcare be limited in scope and 
comprehensiveness. The rapid development of deep learning in recent years has 
opened up opportunities for leveraging big data in healthcare. In this article 
we introduce a temporal-spatial correlation attention network (TSCAN) to address 
various clinical characteristic prediction problems, including mortality 
prediction, length of stay prediction, physiologic decline detection, and 
phenotype classification. Leveraging the attention mechanism model's design, our 
approach efficiently identifies relevant items in clinical data and temporally 
correlated nodes based on specific tasks, resulting in improved prediction 
accuracy. Additionally, our method identifies crucial clinical indicators 
associated with significant outcomes, which can inform and enhance treatment 
options. Our experiments utilize data from the publicly accessible Medical 
Information Mart for Intensive Care (MIMIC-IV) database. Finally, our approach 
demonstrates notable performance improvements of 2.0% (metric) compared to other 
SOTA prediction methods. Specifically, we achieved an impressive 90.7% mortality 
rate prediction accuracy and 45.1% accuracy in length of stay prediction.

Introduction: Mechanical ventilation is a life-saving treatment in the Intensive 
Care Unit (ICU), but often causes patients to be at risk of further respiratory 
complication. We created a statistical model utilizing electronic health record 
and physiologic vitals data to predict the Center for Disease Control and 
Prevention (CDC) defined Ventilator Associated Complications (VACs). Further, we 
evaluated the effect of data temporal resolution and feature generation method 
choice on the accuracy of such a constructed model. Methods: We constructed a 
random forest model to predict occurrence of VACs using health records and chart 
events from adult patients in the Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care 
III (MIMIC-III) database. We trained the machine learning models on two patient 
populations of 1921 and 464 based on low and high frequency data availability. 
Model features were generated using both basic statistical summaries and 
tsfresh, a python library that generates a large number of derived time-series 
features. Classification to determine whether a patient will experience VAC one 
hour after 35 h of ventilation was performed using a random forest classifier. 
Two different sample spaces conditioned on five varying feature extraction 
techniques were evaluated to identify the most optimal selection of features 
resulting in the best VAC discrimination. Each dataset was assessed using 
K-folds cross-validation (k = 10), giving average area under the receiver 
operating characteristic curves (AUROCs) and accuracies. Results: After feature 
selection, hyperparameter tuning, and feature extraction, the best performing 
model used automatically generated features on high frequency data and achieved 
an average AUROC of 0.83 ± 0.11 and an average accuracy of 0.69 ± 0.10. 
Discussion: Results show the potential viability of predicting VACs using 
machine learning, and indicate that higher-resolution data and the larger 
feature set generated by tsfresh yield better AUROCs compared to 
lower-resolution data and manual statistical features.

BACKGROUND: Predicting intensive care unit (ICU) discharge for neurosurgical 
patients is crucial for optimizing bed sources, reducing costs, and improving 
outcomes. Our study aims to develop and validate machine learning (ML) models to 
predict ICU discharge within 24 h for patients undergoing craniotomy.
METHODS: The 2,742 patients undergoing craniotomy were identified from Medical 
Information Mart for Intensive Care dataset using diagnosis-related group and 
International Classification of Diseases codes. Demographic, clinical, 
laboratory, and radiological data were collected and preprocessed. Textual 
clinical examinations were converted into numerical scales. Data were split into 
training (70%), validation (15%), and test (15%) sets. Four ML models, logistic 
regression (LR), decision tree, random forest, and neural network (NN), were 
trained and evaluated. Model performance was assessed using area under the 
receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC), average precision (AP), accuracy, 
and F1 scores. Shapley Additive Explanations (SHAP) were used to analyze 
importance of features. Statistical analyses were performed using R (version 
4.2.1) and ML analyses with Python (version 3.8), using scikit-learn, 
tensorflow, and shap packages.
RESULTS: Cohort included 2,742 patients (mean age 58.2 years; first and third 
quartiles 47-70 years), with 53.4% being male (n = 1,464). Total ICU stay was 
15,645 bed days (mean length of stay 4.7 days), and total hospital stay was 
32,008 bed days (mean length of stay 10.8 days). Random forest demonstrated 
highest performance (AUC 0.831, AP 0.561, accuracy 0.827, F1-score 0.339) on 
test set. NN achieved an AUC of 0.824, with an AP, accuracy, and F1-score of 
0.558, 0.830, and 0.383, respectively. LR achieved an AUC of 0.821 and an 
accuracy of 0.829. The decision tree model showed lowest performance (AUC 0.813, 
accuracy 0.822). Key predictors of SHAP analysis included Glasgow Coma Scale, 
respiratory-related parameters (i.e., tidal volume, respiratory effort), 
intracranial pressure, arterial pH, and Richmond Agitation-Sedation Scale.
CONCLUSIONS: Random forest and NN predict ICU discharge well, whereas LR is 
interpretable but less accurate. Numeric conversion of clinical data improved 
performance. This study offers framework for predictions using clinical, 
radiological, and demographic features, with SHAP enhancing transparency.

External validation of models for the prediction of acute kidney injury (AKI) is 
rare. We externally validate AKI prediction models in intensive care units. The 
models were developed on the Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care dataset 
and validated on the eICU dataset. Traditional machine learning models show 
limited transportability to the new population (AUROC < 0.8). Models based on 
recurrent neural networks, which can capture complex relationships between the 
data, transport well to the new population (AUROC 0.8-0.9). Such models can help 
clinicians to recognize AKI and improve the outcome.

(1) Background: Urinary tract infection (UTI) is a leading cause of emergency 
department visits and hospital admissions. Despite many studies identifying 
UTI-related risk factors for bacteremia or sepsis, a significant gap remains in 
developing predictive models for in-hospital mortality or the necessity for 
emergent intensive care unit admission in the emergency department. This study 
aimed to construct interpretable machine learning models capable of identifying 
patients at high risk for critical outcomes. (2) Methods: This was a 
retrospective study of adult patients with urinary tract infection (UTI), 
extracted from the Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care IV Emergency 
Department (MIMIC-IV-ED) database. The critical outcome is defined as either 
in-hospital mortality or transfer to an intensive care unit within 12 h. ED 
visits were randomly partitioned into a 70%/30% split for training and 
validation. The extreme gradient boosting (XGBoost), random forest (RF), and 
support vector machine (SVM) algorithms were constructed using variables 
selected from the stepwise logistic regression model. The XGBoost model was then 
compared to the traditional model and clinical decision rules (CDRs) on the 
validation data using the area under the curve (AUC). (3) Results: There were 
3622 visits among 3235 unique patients diagnosed with UTI. Of the 2535 patients 
in the training group, 836 (33%) experienced critical outcomes, and of the 1087 
patients in the validation group, 358 (32.9%) did. The AUCs for different 
machine learning models were as follows: XGBoost, 0.833; RF, 0.814; and SVM, 
0.799. The XGBoost model performed better than others. (4) Conclusions: Machine 
learning models outperformed existing traditional CDRs for predicting critical 
outcomes of ED patients with UTI. Future research should prospectively evaluate 
the effectiveness of this approach and integrate it into clinical practice.

OBJECTIVE: Delirium is a common and acute neuropsychiatric syndrome that 
requires timely intervention to prevent its associated morbidity and mortality. 
Yet, its diagnosis and symptoms are often overlooked due to its variable 
clinical presentation and fluctuating nature. Thus, in this study, we address 
the barriers to delirium diagnosis by utilizing a machine learning-based 
predictive algorithm for incident delirium that relies on archived electronic 
health records (EHRs) data.
METHODS: We used the Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care (MIMIC) 
database to create a detailed dataset for identifying delirium in intensive care 
unit (ICU) patients. Our approach involved training machine learning models on 
this dataset to pinpoint critical clinical features for delirium detection. 
These features were then refined and applied to non-ICU patients using EHRs from 
the American University of Beirut Medical Center (AUBMC).
RESULTS: Our study assessed machine learning models like Extreme Gradient 
Boosting (XGBoost), Categorical Boosting (CatBoost), Classification and 
Regression Trees (CART), Random Forest (RF), Neural Oblivious Decision Ensembles 
(NODE), and Logistic Regression (LR), highlighting superior delirium detection 
in diverse clinical settings. The CatBoost model excelled in ICU environments 
with an F1 Score of 89.2%, while XGBoost performed best in general hospital 
settings with a 75.4% F1 Score. Interpretations using Tabular Local 
Interpretable Model-agnostic Explanations (LIME) revealed critical indicators 
such as prothrombin time and hematocrit levels, enhancing model transparency and 
clinical applicability. These clinical insights help differentiate the delirium 
predictors between ICU patients, who are often sensitive to various factors.
CONCLUSION: The proposed predictive algorithm improves delirium detection rates 
and streamlines efficiency in hospital electronic systems, thereby enabling 
prompt interventions to prevent delirium progression and associated 
complications. The clinical indicators for delirium that we identified in 
general hospital settings and ICU can greatly help healthcare professionals 
identify potential causes of delirium and reduce misdiagnosis.

BACKGROUND: Organ dysfunction (OD) assessment is essential in intensive care 
units (ICUs). However, current OD assessment scores merely describe the number 
and the severity of each OD, without evaluating the duration of organ injury. 
The objective of this study is to develop and validate a machine learning model 
based on the Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (SOFA) score for the prediction 
of mortality in critically ill patients.
MATERIAL AND METHODS: Data from the eICU Collaborative Research Database and 
Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care (MIMIC) -III were mixed for model 
development. The MIMIC-IV and Nanjing Jinling Hospital Surgical ICU database 
were used as external test set A and set B, respectively. The outcome of 
interest was in-ICU mortality. A modified SOFA model incorporating 
time-dimension (T-SOFA) was stepwise developed to predict ICU mortality using 
extreme gradient boosting (XGBoost), support vector machine, random forest and 
logistic regression algorithms. Time-dimensional features were calculated based 
on six consecutive SOFA scores collected every 12 h within the first three days 
of admission. The predictive performance was assessed with the area under the 
receiver operating characteristic curves (AUROC) and calibration plot.
RESULTS: A total of 82,132 patients from the real-world datasets were included 
in this study, and 7,494 patients (9.12%) died during their ICU stay. The T-SOFA 
M3 that incorporated the time-dimension features and age, using the XGBoost 
algorithm, significantly outperformed the original SOFA score in the validation 
set (AUROC 0.800 95% CI [0.787-0.813] vs. 0.693 95% CI [0.678-0.709], p < 0.01). 
Good discrimination and calibration were maintained in the test set A and B, 
with AUROC of 0.803, 95% CI [0.791-0.815] and 0.830, 95% CI [0.789-0.870], 
respectively.
CONCLUSIONS: The time-incorporated T-SOFA model could significantly improve the 
prediction performance of the original SOFA score and is of potential for 
identifying high-risk patients in future clinical application.

BACKGROUND: Recent research has revealed the potential value of machine learning 
(ML) models in improving prognostic prediction for patients with trauma. ML can 
enhance predictions and identify which factors contribute the most to 
posttraumatic mortality. However, no studies have explored the risk factors, 
complications, and risk prediction of preoperative and postoperative traumatic 
coagulopathy (PPTIC) in patients with trauma.
OBJECTIVE: This study aims to help clinicians implement timely and appropriate 
interventions to reduce the incidence of PPTIC and related complications, 
thereby lowering in-hospital mortality and disability rates for patients with 
trauma.
METHODS: We analyzed data from 13,235 patients with trauma from 4 medical 
centers, including medical histories, laboratory results, and hospitalization 
complications. We developed 10 ML models in Python (Python Software Foundation) 
to predict PPTIC based on preoperative indicators. Data from 10,023 Medical 
Information Mart for Intensive Care patients were divided into training (70%) 
and test (30%) sets, with 3212 patients from 3 other centers used for external 
validation. Model performance was assessed with 5-fold cross-validation, 
bootstrapping, Brier score, and Shapley additive explanation values.
RESULTS: Univariate logistic regression identified PPTIC risk factors as (1) 
prolonged activated partial thromboplastin time, prothrombin time, and 
international normalized ratio; (2) decreased levels of hemoglobin, hematocrit, 
red blood cells, calcium, and sodium; (3) lower admission diastolic blood 
pressure; (4) elevated alanine aminotransferase and aspartate aminotransferase 
levels; (5) admission heart rate; and (6) emergency surgery and perioperative 
transfusion. Multivariate logistic regression revealed that patients with PPTIC 
faced significantly higher risks of sepsis (1.75-fold), heart failure 
(1.5-fold), delirium (3.08-fold), abnormal coagulation (3.57-fold), tracheostomy 
(2.76-fold), mortality (2.19-fold), and urinary tract infection (1.95-fold), 
along with longer hospital and intensive care unit stays. Random forest was the 
most effective ML model for predicting PPTIC, achieving an area under the 
receiver operating characteristic of 0.91, an area under the 
precision-recall curve of 0.89, accuracy of 0.84, sensitivity of 0.80, 
specificity of 0.88, precision of 0.88, F1-score of 0.84, and Brier score of 
0.13 in external validation.
CONCLUSIONS: Key PPTIC risk factors include (1) prolonged activated partial 
thromboplastin time, prothrombin time, and international normalized ratio; (2) 
low levels of hemoglobin, hematocrit, red blood cells, calcium, and sodium; (3) 
low diastolic blood pressure; (4) elevated alanine aminotransferase and 
aspartate aminotransferase levels; (5) admission heart rate; and (6) the need 
for emergency surgery and transfusion. PPTIC is associated with severe 
complications and extended hospital stays. Among the ML models, the random 
forest model was the most effective predictor.

BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Excess fluid balance in acute kidney injury (AKI) may 
be harmful, and conversely, some patients may respond to fluid challenges. This 
study aimed to develop a prediction model that can be used to differentiate 
between volume-responsive (VR) and volume-unresponsive (VU) AKI.
METHODS: AKI patients with urine output < 0.5 ml/kg/h for the first 6 h after 
ICU admission and fluid intake > 5 l in the following 6 h in the US-based 
critical care database (Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care (MIMIC-III)) 
were considered. Patients who received diuretics and renal replacement on day 1 
were excluded. Two predictive models, using either machine learning extreme 
gradient boosting (XGBoost) or logistic regression, were developed to predict 
urine output > 0.65 ml/kg/h during 18 h succeeding the initial 6 h for assessing 
oliguria. Established models were assessed by using out-of-sample validation. 
The whole sample was split into training and testing samples by the ratio of

MAIN RESULTS: Of the 6682 patients included in the analysis, 2456 (36.8%) 
patients were volume responsive with an increase in urine output after receiving 
> 5 l fluid. Urinary creatinine, blood urea nitrogen (BUN), age, and albumin 
were the important predictors of VR. The machine learning XGBoost model 
outperformed the traditional logistic regression model in differentiating 
between the VR and VU groups (AU-ROC, 0.860; 95% CI, 0.842 to 0.878 vs. 0.728; 
95% CI 0.703 to 0.753, respectively).
CONCLUSIONS: The XGBoost model was able to differentiate between patients who 
would and would not respond to fluid intake in urine output better than a 
traditional logistic regression model. This result suggests that machine 
learning techniques have the potential to improve the development and validation 
of predictive modeling in critical care research.

BACKGROUND: Early prediction of hospital mortality is crucial for ICU patients 
with sepsis. This study aimed to develop a novel blending machine learning (ML) 
model for hospital mortality prediction in ICU patients with sepsis.
METHODS: Two ICU databases were employed: eICU Collaborative Research Database 
(eICU-CRD) and Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care III (MIMIC-III). All 
adult patients who fulfilled Sepsis-3 criteria were identified. Samples from 
eICU-CRD constituted training set and samples from MIMIC-III constituted test 
set. Stepwise logistic regression model was used for predictor selection. 
Blending ML model which integrated nine sorts of basic ML models was developed 
for hospital mortality prediction in ICU patients with sepsis. Model performance 
was evaluated by various measures related to discrimination or calibration.
RESULTS: Twelve thousand five hundred fifty-eight patients from eICU-CRD were 
included as the training set, and 12,095 patients from MIMIC-III were included 
as the test set. Both the training set and the test set showed a hospital 
mortality of 17.9%. Maximum and minimum lactate, maximum and minimum albumin, 
minimum PaO2/FiO2 and age were important predictors identified by both random 
forest and extreme gradient boosting algorithm. Blending ML models based on 
corresponding set of predictors presented better discrimination than SAPS II 
(AUROC, 0.806 vs. 0.771; AUPRC 0.515 vs. 0.429) and SOFA (AUROC, 0.742 vs. 
0.706; AUPRC 0.428 vs. 0.381) on the test set. In addition, calibration curves 
showed that blending ML models had better calibration than SAPS II.
CONCLUSIONS: The blending ML model is capable of integrating different sorts of 
basic ML models efficiently, and outperforms conventional severity scores in 
predicting hospital mortality among septic patients in ICU.

Clinical notes are comprehensive files containing explicit information about a 
patient's visit. However, accurately assigning medical codes from clinical 
documents can be a persistent challenge due to the complexity of clinical data 
and the vast range of medical codes. Moreover, the large volume of medical 
records, the noisy medical records, and the uneven quality of coders all 
negatively impact the quality of the final codes. Deep learning technology has 
recently been integrated into automatic International Classification of Diseases 
(ICD) coding tasks to improve accuracy. Nevertheless, the imbalanced class 
problem, the complexness of code associations, and the noise in lengthy records 
still restrict the advancement of ICD coding tasks in deep learning. Thus, we 
present the Note-code Interaction Denoising Network (NIDN) that employs the 
self-attention mechanism to pull critical semantic features in electronic 
medical records (EMRs). Our model utilizes the label attention mechanism for 
retaining code-specific text expression. We introduce Clinical Classifications 
Software coding for multitask learning, capturing the functional relationships 
of medical coding to oblige in model prediction. To minimize the impact of noise 
on model prediction and improve the label distribution imbalance, a denoising 
module is introduced to filter noise. Our practical consequences indicate that 
the model NIDN exceeds competitive models on a third version of Medical 
Information Mart for Intensive Care data set.

BACKGROUND: An electronic health record (EHR) holds detailed longitudinal 
information about a patient's health status and general clinical history, a 
large portion of which is stored as unstructured, free text. Existing approaches 
to model a patient's trajectory focus mostly on structured data and a subset of 
single-domain outcomes. This study aims to evaluate the effectiveness of 
Foresight, a generative transformer in temporal modelling of patient data, 
integrating both free text and structured formats, to predict a diverse array of 
future medical outcomes, such as disorders, substances (eg, to do with 
medicines, allergies, or poisonings), procedures, and findings (eg, relating to 
observations, judgements, or assessments).
METHODS: Foresight is a novel transformer-based pipeline that uses named entity 
recognition and linking tools to convert EHR document text into structured, 
coded concepts, followed by providing probabilistic forecasts for future medical 
events, such as disorders, substances, procedures, and findings. The Foresight 
pipeline has four main components: (1) CogStack (data retrieval and 
preprocessing); (2) the Medical Concept Annotation Toolkit (structuring of the 
free-text information from EHRs); (3) Foresight Core (deep-learning model for 
biomedical concept modelling); and (4) the Foresight web application. We 
processed the entire free-text portion from three different hospital datasets 
(King's College Hospital [KCH], South London and Maudsley [SLaM], and the US 
Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care III [MIMIC-III]), resulting in 
information from 811 336 patients and covering both physical and mental health 
institutions. We measured the performance of models using custom metrics derived 
from precision and recall.
FINDINGS: Foresight achieved a precision@10 (ie, of 10 forecasted candidates, at 
least one is correct) of 0·68 (SD 0·0027) for the KCH dataset, 0·76 (0·0032) for 
the SLaM dataset, and 0·88 (0·0018) for the MIMIC-III dataset, for forecasting 
the next new disorder in a patient timeline. Foresight also achieved a 
precision@10 value of 0·80 (0·0013) for the KCH dataset, 0·81 (0·0026) for the 
SLaM dataset, and 0·91 (0·0011) for the MIMIC-III dataset, for forecasting the 
next new biomedical concept. In addition, Foresight was validated on 34 
synthetic patient timelines by five clinicians and achieved a relevancy of 33 
(97% [95% CI 91-100]) of 34 for the top forecasted candidate disorder. As a 
generative model, Foresight can forecast follow-on biomedical concepts for as 
many steps as required.
INTERPRETATION: Foresight is a general-purpose model for biomedical concept 
modelling that can be used for real-world risk forecasting, virtual trials, and 
clinical research to study the progression of disorders, to simulate 
interventions and counterfactuals, and for educational purposes.

Health care is one of the most exciting frontiers in data mining and machine 
learning. Successful adoption of electronic health records (EHRs) created an 
explosion in digital clinical data available for analysis, but progress in 
machine learning for healthcare research has been difficult to measure because 
of the absence of publicly available benchmark data sets. To address this 
problem, we propose four clinical prediction benchmarks using data derived from 
the publicly available Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care (MIMIC-III) 
database. These tasks cover a range of clinical problems including modeling risk 
of mortality, forecasting length of stay, detecting physiologic decline, and 
phenotype classification. We propose strong linear and neural baselines for all 
four tasks and evaluate the effect of deep supervision, multitask training and 
data-specific architectural modifications on the performance of neural models.

OBJECTIVE: Aortic dissection (AD) is a severe emergency with high morbidity and 
mortality, necessitating strict monitoring and management. This retrospective 
study aimed to identify prognostic factors and establish predictive models for 
in-hospital mortality among AD patients in the intensive care unit (ICU).
METHODS: We retrieved ICU admission records of AD patients from the Medical 
Information Mart for Intensive Care (MIMIC)-IV critical care data set and the 
eICU Collaborative Research Database. Functional data analysis was further 
applied to estimate continuous vital sign processes, and variables associated 
with in-hospital mortality were identified through univariate analyses. 
Subsequently, we employed multivariable logistic regression and machine learning 
techniques, including simple decision tree, random forest (RF), and eXtreme 
Gradient Boosting (XGBoost) to develop prognostic models for in-hospital 
mortality.
RESULTS: Given 643 ICU admissions from MIMIC-IV and 501 admissions from eICU, 29 
and 28 prognostic factors were identified from each database through univariate 
analyses, respectively. For prognostic model construction, 507 MIMIC-IV 
admissions were divided into 406 (80%) for training and 101 (20%) for internal 
validation, and 87 eICU admissions were included as an external validation 
group. Of the four models tested, the RF consistently exhibited the best 
performance among different variable subsets, boasting area under the receiver 
operating characteristic curves of 0.870 and 0.850. The models highlighted the 
mean 24-h fluid intake as the most potent prognostic factor.
CONCLUSIONS: The current prognostic models effectively forecasted in-hospital 
mortality among AD patients, and they pinpointed noteworthy prognostic factors, 
including initial blood pressure upon ICU admission and mean 24-h fluid intake.

Background: Many severity scores are widely used for clinical outcome prediction 
for critically ill patients in the intensive care unit (ICU). However, for 
patients identified by sepsis-3 criteria, none of these have been developed. 
This study aimed to develop and validate a risk stratification score for 
mortality prediction in sepsis-3 patients. Methods: In this retrospective cohort 
study, we employed the Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care III (MIMIC 
III) database for model development and the eICU database for external 
validation. We identified septic patients by sepsis-3 criteria on day 1 of ICU 
entry. The Least Absolute Shrinkage and Selection Operator (LASSO) technique was 
performed to select predictive variables. We also developed a sepsis mortality 
prediction model and associated risk stratification score. We then compared 
model discrimination and calibration with other traditional severity scores. 
Results: For model development, we enrolled a total of 5,443 patients fulfilling 
the sepsis-3 criteria. The 30-day mortality was 16.7%. With 5,658 septic 
patients in the validation set, there were 1,135 deaths (mortality 20.1%). The 
score had good discrimination in development and validation sets (area under 
curve: 0.789 and 0.765). In the validation set, the calibration slope was 0.862, 
and the Brier value was 0.140. In the development dataset, the score divided 
patients according to mortality risk of low (3.2%), moderate (12.4%), high 
(30.7%), and very high (68.1%). The corresponding mortality in the validation 
dataset was 2.8, 10.5, 21.1, and 51.2%. As shown by the decision curve analysis, 
the score always had a positive net benefit. Conclusion: We observed moderate 
discrimination and calibration for the score termed Sepsis Mortality Risk Score 
(SMRS), allowing stratification of patients according to mortality risk. 
However, we still require further modification and external validation.

BACKGROUND: People with traumatic brain injury (TBI) are at high risk for 
infection and sepsis. The aim of the study was to develop and validate an 
explainable machine learning(ML) model based on clinical features for early 
prediction of the risk of sepsis in TBI patients.
METHODS: We enrolled all patients with TBI in the Medical Information Mart for 
Intensive Care IV database from 2008 to 2019. All patients were randomly divided 
into a training set (70%) and a test set (30%). The univariate and multivariate 
regression analyses were used for feature selection. Six ML methods were applied 
to develop the model. The predictive performance of different models were 
determined based on the area under the curve (AUC) and calibration curves in the 
test cohort. In addition, we selected the eICU Collaborative Research Database 
version 1.2 as the external validation dataset. Finally, we used the Shapley 
additive interpretation to account for the effects of features attributed to the 
model.
RESULTS: Of the 1555 patients enrolled in the final cohort, 834 (53.6%) patients 
developed sepsis after TBI. Six variables were associated with concomitant 
sepsis and were used to develop ML models. Of the 6 models constructed, the 
Extreme Gradient Boosting (XGB) model achieved the best performance with an AUC 
of 0.807 and an accuracy of 74.5% in the internal validation cohort, and an AUC 
of 0.762 for the external validation. Feature importance analysis revealed that 
use mechanical ventilation, SAPSII score, use intravenous pressors, blood 
transfusion on admission, history of diabetes, and presence of post-stroke 
sequelae were the top six most influential features of the XGB model.
CONCLUSION: As shown in the study, the ML model could be used to predict the 
occurrence of sepsis in patients with TBI in the intensive care unit.

Handling Class Imbalance in Machine Learning-based Prediction Models: A Case 
Study in Asthma Management.

Budiarto A, Sheikh A, Wilson A, Price DB, Shah SA.

A data-driven prediction tool has the potential to provide early warning of an 
asthma attack and improve asthma management and outcomes. Most previous machine 
learning (ML)-based studies for asthma attack prediction have reported a severe 
class imbalance, with major implications for model performance. We aimed to 
undertake a systematic comparison of several class imbalance handling techniques 
in the context of risk prediction models for asthma prognosis. We used data from 
9,835 asthma patients extracted from the Medical Information Mart for Intensive 
Care (MIMIC) IV database and deployed five class imbalance handling methods 
based on synthetic minority oversampling technique (SMOTE) and cost function 
customisation. We then compared their performances in improving two-class 
classifier models developed using logistic regression (LR) and extreme gradient 
boosting (XGBoost) for three different prediction tasks with varying severity of 
class imbalance (proportion of majority class ranging from 90.86% to 98.98%). 
The cost function customisation technique substantially outperformed the 
SMOTE-based methods in all tasks. XGBoost combined with cost function 
customisation achieved the highest prediction performance for the outcome with 
the most extreme class imbalance ratio (AUC = 0.72). Our findings suggest that 
the cost function customisation-based approach to tackle class imbalance 
provides substantially better performance compared to oversampling in the 
context of asthma management.Clinical Relevance- This study underscores the 
challenge of class imbalance in the context of prediction tools to improve 
asthma management and outcomes and provides a methodological solution that 
addresses the challenge. Accurate asthma prediction tools can provide early 
warning and potentially prevent deterioration thereby improving the quality of 
life of patients with asthma.

Background: Acute ischemic stroke is a leading cause of death in the United 
States. Identifying patients with stroke at high risk of mortality is crucial 
for timely intervention and optimal resource allocation. This study aims to 
develop and validate machine learning-based models to predict in-hospital 
mortality risk for intensive care unit (ICU) patients with acute ischemic stroke 
and identify important associated factors. Methods: Our data include 3,489 acute 
ischemic stroke admissions to the ICU for patients not discharged or dead within 
48 h from the Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care-IV (MIMIC-IV) 
database. Demographic, hospitalization type, procedure, medication, intake 
(intravenous and oral), laboratory, vital signs, and clinical assessment [e.g., 
Glasgow Coma Scale Scores (GCS)] during the initial 48 h of admissions were used 
to predict in-hospital mortality after 48 h of ICU admission. We explored 3 
machine learning models (random forests, logistic regression, and XGBoost) and 
applied Bayesian optimization for hyperparameter tuning. Important features were 
identified using learned coefficients. Results: Experiments show that XGBoost 
tuned for area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC ROC) was 
the best performing model (AUC ROC 0.86, F1 0.52), compared to random forests 
(AUC ROC 0.85, F1 0.47) and logistic regression (AUC ROC 0.75, F1 0.40). Top 
features include GCS, blood urea nitrogen, and Richmond RASS score. The model 
also demonstrates good fairness for males versus females and across 
racial/ethnic groups. Conclusions: Machine learning has shown great potential in 
predicting in-hospital mortality risk for people with acute ischemic stroke in 
the ICU setting. However, more ethical considerations need to be applied to 
ensure that performance differences across different racial/ethnic groups will 
not exacerbate existing health disparities and will not harm historically 
marginalized populations.

BACKGROUND: The triglyceride-glucose (TyG) index and stress hyperglycemia ratio 
(SHR) have been linked to the cardiovascular risks in critical ill patients. 
However, little is known about the predictive power of the TyG index, SHR and 
their combination on the incidence and mortality risks of new-onset atrial 
fibrillation (NOAF) in patients with sepsis.
METHOD: This retrospective study included patients from the Medical Information 
Mart for Intensive Care (MIMIC)-IV database. Primary outcomes were defined as 
the incidence and 360-day mortality of in-hospital NOAF among patients with 
sepsis. Logistic model, Cox proportional hazard model, Kaplan-Meier analysis and 
receiver-operating characteristic (ROC) were performed to explore the 
association between the indices and clinical outcomes. Machine learning approach 
also was constructed to evaluate and compare the indices in predicting mortality 
risks.
RESULTS: 4276 patients meeting the inclusion criteria were enrolled and 764 
individuals developed NOAF during hospitalization. The multivariable adjusted 
odds ratios (95%, CI) of incidence of NOAF in patients with sepsis in the 
highest group versus the lowest group were 1.36 (1.10-1.69), 1.35 (1.09-1.67) 
and 1.58 (1.23-2.02), respectively, for the TyG index, SHR and the TyG index-SHR 
combination. However, the predictive powers of these indices were relatively 
low. Among septic patients who developed in-hospital NOAF, those in the highest 
TyG index group and the highest SHR group exhibited an increased risk of 360-day 
mortality compared with those with the lowest TyG index and the lowest SHR (the 
TyG index: hazard ratio [HR] 1.59, 95% CI 1.00-2.62; SHR: HR 1.67, 95% CI 
1.03-2.70). Patients with both the highest the TyG index and the highest SHR 
demonstrated the highest risk of 360-day mortality (HR 1.72, 95% CI 1.08-2.72). 
The ROC also confirmed the TyG index-SHR combination had more robust predictive 
power for 360-day mortality among septic patients with NOAF than the TyG index 
and SHR itself (p < 0.05). The random forest model validated that the predictive 
capability was significantly enhanced with the integration of the TyG index and 
SHR.
CONCLUSION: The TyG index and SHR were associated with the incidence of 
in-hospital NOAF during sepsis, although their predictive powers were limited. 
In septic patients with in-hospital NOAF, high levels of the TyG index and SHR 
were significantly associated with increased 360-day mortality risks, with their 
combination demonstrating superior predictive power. Joint assessments of the 
TyG index and SHR could help identify individuals at high risks of mortality 
post-discharge, enabling clinicians to prioritize follow-up care and improve 
patient management.

BACKGROUND: Traditional scoring systems for patients' outcome prediction in 
intensive care units such as Oxygenation Saturation Index (OSI) and Oxygenation 
Index (OI) may not reliably predict the clinical prognosis of patients with 
acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). Thus, none of them have been widely 
accepted for mortality prediction in ARDS. This study aimed to develop and 
validate a mortality prediction method for patients with ARDS based on machine 
learning using the Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care (MIMIC-III) and 
Telehealth Intensive Care Unit (eICU) Collaborative Research Database (eICU-CRD) 
databases.
METHODS: Patients with ARDS were selected based on the Berlin definition in 
MIMIC-III and eICU-CRD databases. The APPS score (using age, PaO2/FiO2, and 
plateau pressure), Simplified Acute Physiology Score II (SAPS-II), 
Sepsis-related Organ Failure Assessment (SOFA), OSI, and OI were calculated. 
With MIMIC-III data, a mortality prediction model was built based on the random 
forest (RF) algorithm, and the performance was compared to those of existing 
scoring systems based on logistic regression. The performance of the proposed RF 
method was also validated with the combined MIMIC-III and eICU-CRD data. The 
performance of mortality prediction was evaluated by using the area under the 
receiver operating characteristics curve (AUROC) and performing calibration 
using the Hosmer-Lemeshow test.
RESULTS: With the MIMIC-III dataset (308 patients, for comparisons with the 
existing scoring systems), the RF model predicted the in-hospital mortality, 
30-day mortality, and 1-year mortality with an AUROC of 0.891, 0.883, and 0.892, 
respectively, which were significantly higher than those of the SAPS-II, APPS, 
OSI, and OI (all P<0.001). In the multi-source validation (the combined dataset 
of 2,235 patients in MIMIC-III and 331 patients in eICU-CRD), the RF model 
achieved an AUROC of 0.905 and 0.736 for predicting in-hospital mortality for 
the MIMIC-III and eICU-CRD datasets, respectively. The calibration plots 
suggested good fits for our RF model and these scoring systems for predicting 
mortality. The platelet count and lactate level were the strongest predictive 
variables for predicting in-hospital mortality.
CONCLUSIONS: Compared to the existing scoring systems, machine learning 
significantly improved performance for predicting ARDS mortality. Validation 
with multi-source datasets showed a relatively robust generalisation ability of 
our prediction model.

Sepsis is defined by life-threatening organ dysfunction during infection and is 
the leading cause of death in hospitals. During sepsis, there is a high risk 
that new onset of atrial fibrillation (AF) can occur, which is associated with 
significant morbidity and mortality. Consequently, early prediction of AF during 
sepsis would allow testing of interventions in the intensive care unit (ICU) to 
prevent AF and its severe complications. In this paper, we present a novel 
automated AF prediction algorithm for critically ill sepsis patients using 
electrocardiogram (ECG) signals. From the heart rate signal collected from 5-min 
ECG, feature extraction is performed using the traditional time, frequency, and 
nonlinear domain methods. Moreover, variable frequency complex demodulation and 
tunable Q-factor wavelet-transform-based time-frequency methods are applied to 
extract novel features from the heart rate signal. Using a selected feature 
subset, several machine learning classifiers, including support vector machine 
(SVM) and random forest (RF), were trained using only the 2001 Computers in 
Cardiology data set. For testing the proposed method, 50 critically ill ICU 
subjects from the Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care (MIMIC) III 
database were used in this study. Using distinct and independent testing data 
from MIMIC III, the SVM achieved 80% sensitivity, 100% specificity, 90% 
accuracy, 100% positive predictive value, and 83.33% negative predictive value 
for predicting AF immediately prior to the onset of AF, while the RF achieved 
88% AF prediction accuracy. When we analyzed how much in advance we can predict 
AF events in critically ill sepsis patients, the algorithm achieved 80% accuracy 
for predicting AF events 10 min early. Our algorithm outperformed a 
state-of-the-art method for predicting AF in ICU patients, further demonstrating 
the efficacy of our proposed method. The annotations of patients' AF transition 
information will be made publicly available for other investigators. Our 
algorithm to predict AF onset is applicable for any ECG modality including patch 
electrodes and wearables, including Holter, loop recorder, and implantable 
devices.

PURPOSE: To assess the performance of models for early prediction of acute 
kidney injury (AKI) in the Intensive Care Unit (ICU) setting.
PATIENTS AND METHODS: Data were collected from the Medical Information Mart for 
Intensive Care (MIMIC)-III database for all patients aged ≥18 years who had 
their serum creatinine (SCr) level measured for 72 h following ICU admission. 
Those with existing conditions of kidney disease upon ICU admission were 
excluded from our analyses. Seventeen predictor variables comprising patient 
demographics and physiological indicators were selected on the basis of the 
Kidney Disease Improving Global Outcomes (KDIGO) and medical literature. Six 
models from three types of methods were tested: Logistic Regression (LR), 
Support Vector Machines (SVM), Random Forest (RF), eXtreme Gradient Boosting 
(XGBoost), Light Gradient Boosting Decision Machine (LightGBM), and 
Convolutional Neural Network (CNN). The area under receiver operating 
characteristic curve (AUC), accuracy, precision, recall and F-measure (F1) were 
calculated for each model to evaluate performance.
RESULTS: We extracted the ICU records of 17,205 patients from MIMIC-III dataset. 
LightGBM had the best performance, with all evaluation indicators achieving the 
highest value (average AUC = 0.905, F1 = 0.897, recall = 0.836). XGBoost had the 
second best performance and LR, RF, SVM performed similarly (P = 0.082, 0.158 
and 0.710, respectively) on AUC. The CNN model achieved the lowest score for 
accuracy, precision, F1 and AUC. SVM and LR had relatively low recall compared 
with that of the other models. The SCr level had the most significant effect on 
the early prediction of AKI onset in LR, RF, SVM and LightGBM.
CONCLUSION: LightGBM demonstrated the best capability for predicting AKI in the 
first 72 h of ICU admission. LightGBM and XGBoost showed great potential for 
clinical application owing to their high recall value. This study can provide 
references for artificial intelligence-powered clinical decision support systems 
for AKI early prediction in the ICU setting.

BACKGROUND: Whether intubation should be initiated early in the clinical course 
of critically ill patients remains a matter of debate. Results from prior 
observational studies are difficult to interpret because of avoidable flaws 
including immortal time bias, inappropriate eligibility criteria, and 
unrealistic treatment strategies.
RESEARCH QUESTION: Do treatment strategies that intubate patients early in the 
critical care admission improve 30-day survival compared with strategies that 
delay intubation?
STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS: We estimated the effect of strategies that require 
early intubation of critically ill patients compared with those that delay 
intubation. With data extracted from the Medical Information Mart for Intensive 
Care-IV database, we emulated three target trials, varying the flexibility of 
the treatment strategies and the baseline eligibility criteria.
RESULTS: Under unrealistically strict treatment strategies with broad 
eligibility criteria, the 30-day mortality risk was 7.1 percentage points higher 
for intubating early compared with delaying intubation (95% CI, 6.2-7.9). Risk 
differences were 0.4 (95% CI, -0.1 to 0.9) and -0.9 (95% CI, -2.5 to 0.7) 
percentage points in subsequent target trial emulations that included more 
realistic treatment strategies and eligibility criteria.
INTERPRETATION: When realistic treatment strategies and eligibility criteria are 
used, strategies that delay intubation result in similar 30-day mortality risks 
compared with those that intubate early. Delaying intubation ultimately avoids 
intubation in most patients.

The health product circuit corresponds to the chain of steps that a medicine 
goes through in hospital, from prescription to administration. The safety and 
regulation of all the stages of this circuit are major issues to ensure the 
safety and protect the well-being of hospitalized patients. In this paper we 
present an automatic system for analyzing prescriptions using Artificial 
Intelligence (AI) and Machine Learning (ML), with the aim of ensuring patient 
safety by limiting the risk of prescription errors or drug iatrogeny. Our study 
is made in collaboration with Lille University Hospital (LUH). We exploited the 
MIMIC-III (Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care) a large, single-center 
database containing information corresponding to patients admitted to critical 
care units at a large tertiary care hospital.

Cardiac arrest (CA) poses a significant global health challenge and often 
results in poor prognosis. We developed an interpretable and applicable machine 
learning (ML) model for predicting in-hospital mortality of CA patients who 
survived more than 72 h. A total of 721 patients were extracted from the Medical 
Information Mart for Intensive Care IV database, divided into the training set 
(n = 576) and the internal validation set (n = 145). The external validation set 
containing 856 cases were collected from four tertiary hospitals in Zhejiang 
Province. The primary outcome was in-hospital mortality. Eleven ML algorithms 
were utilized to establish prediction models based on data from 72 h after 
return of spontaneous circulation (ROSC). The results indicate that the CatBoost 
model exhibited the best performance at 72 h. Eleven variables were ultimately 
selected as key features by recursive feature elimination (RFE) to construct a 
compact model. The final model achieved the highest AUC of 0.86 (0.80, 0.92) in 
the internal validation and 0.76 (0.73, 0.79) in the external validation. SHAP 
summary plots and force plots visually explained the predicted outcomes. In 
conclusion, 72-h CatBoost showed promising performance in predicting in-hospital 
mortality of CA patients who survived more than 72 h. The model still requires 
further optimization and improvement.

OBJECTIVE: Accurate coding is critical for medical billing and electronic 
medical record (EMR)-based research. Recent research has been focused on 
developing supervised methods to automatically assign International 
Classification of Diseases (ICD) codes from clinical notes. However, supervised 
approaches rely on ICD code data stored in the hospital EMR system and is 
subject to bias rising from the practice and coding behavior. Consequently, 
portability of trained supervised algorithms to external EMR systems may suffer.
METHOD: We developed an unsupervised knowledge integration (UNITE) algorithm to 
automatically assign ICD codes for a specific disease by analyzing clinical 
narrative notes via semantic relevance assessment. The algorithm was validated 
using coded ICD data for 6 diseases from Partners HealthCare (PHS) Biobank and 
Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care (MIMIC-III). We compared the 
performance of UNITE against penalized logistic regression (LR), topic modeling, 
and neural network models within each EMR system. We additionally evaluated the 
portability of UNITE by training at PHS Biobank and validating at MIMIC-III, and 
vice versa.
RESULTS: UNITE achieved an averaged AUC of 0.91 at PHS and 0.92 at MIMIC over 6 
diseases, comparable to LR and MLP. It had substantially better performance than 
topic models. In regards to portability, the performance of UNITE was consistent 
across different EMR systems, superior to LR, topic models and neural network 
models.
CONCLUSION: UNITE accurately assigns ICD code in EMR without requiring human 
labor, and has major advantages over commonly used machine learning approaches. 
In addition, the UNITE attained stable performance and high portability across 
EMRs in different institutions.

BACKGROUND: Knowledge graphs (KGs) play a key role to enable explainable 
artificial intelligence (AI) applications in healthcare. Constructing clinical 
knowledge graphs (CKGs) against heterogeneous electronic health records (EHRs) 
has been desired by the research and healthcare AI communities. From the 
standardization perspective, community-based standards such as the Fast 
Healthcare Interoperability Resources (FHIR) and the Observational Medical 
Outcomes Partnership (OMOP) Common Data Model (CDM) are increasingly used to 
represent and standardize EHR data for clinical data analytics, however, the 
potential of such a standard on building CKG has not been well investigated.
OBJECTIVE: To develop and evaluate methods and tools that expose the OMOP 
CDM-based clinical data repositories into virtual clinical KGs that are 
compliant with FHIR Resource Description Framework (RDF) specification.
METHODS: We developed a system called FHIR-Ontop-OMOP to generate virtual 
clinical KGs from the OMOP relational databases. We leveraged an OMOP CDM-based 
Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care (MIMIC-III) data repository to 
evaluate the FHIR-Ontop-OMOP system in terms of the faithfulness of data 
transformation and the conformance of the generated CKGs to the FHIR RDF 
specification.
RESULTS: A beta version of the system has been released. A total of more than 
100 data element mappings from 11 OMOP CDM clinical data, health system and 
vocabulary tables were implemented in the system, covering 11 FHIR resources. 
The generated virtual CKG from MIMIC-III contains 46,520 instances of FHIR 
Patient, 716,595 instances of Condition, 1,063,525 instances of Procedure, 
24,934,751 instances of MedicationStatement, 365,181,104 instances of 
Observations, and 4,779,672 instances of CodeableConcept. Patient counts 
identified by five pairs of SQL (over the MIMIC database) and SPARQL (over the 
virtual CKG) queries were identical, ensuring the faithfulness of the data 
transformation. Generated CKG in RDF triples for 100 patients were fully 
conformant with the FHIR RDF specification.
CONCLUSION: The FHIR-Ontop-OMOP system can expose OMOP database as a 
FHIR-compliant RDF graph. It provides a meaningful use case demonstrating the 
potentials that can be enabled by the interoperability between FHIR and OMOP 
CDM. Generated clinical KGs in FHIR RDF provide a semantic foundation to enable

Elevated serum chloride levels (hyperchloremia) and the administration of 
intravenous (IV) fluids with high chloride content have both been associated 
with increased morbidity and mortality in certain subgroups of critically ill 
patients, such as those with sepsis. Here, we demonstrate this association in a 
general intensive care unit (ICU) population using data from the Medical 
Information Mart for Intensive Care III (MIMIC-III) database and propose the use 
of supervised learning to predict hyperchloremia in critically ill patients. 
Clinical variables from records of the first 24h of adult ICU stays were 
represented as features for four predictive supervised learning classifiers. The 
best performing model was able to predict second-day hyperchloremia with an AUC 
of 0.80 and a ratio of 5 false alerts for every true alert, which is a 
clinically-actionable rate. Our results suggest that clinicians can be 
effectively alerted to patients at risk of developing hyperchloremia, providing 
an opportunity to mitigate this risk and potentially improve outcomes.

BACKGROUND: Despite the significance and prevalence of acute respiratory 
distress syndrome (ARDS), its detection remains highly variable and 
inconsistent. In this work, we aim to develop an algorithm (ARDSFlag) to 
automate the diagnosis of ARDS based on the Berlin definition. We also aim to 
develop a visualization tool that helps clinicians efficiently assess ARDS 
criteria.
METHODS: ARDSFlag applies machine learning (ML) and natural language processing 
(NLP) techniques to evaluate Berlin criteria by incorporating structured and 
unstructured data in an electronic health record (EHR) system. The study cohort 
includes 19,534 ICU admissions in the Medical Information Mart for Intensive 
Care III (MIMIC-III) database. The output is the ARDS diagnosis, onset time, and 
severity.
RESULTS: ARDSFlag includes separate text classifiers trained using large 
training sets to find evidence of bilateral infiltrates in radiology reports 
(accuracy of 91.9%±0.5%) and heart failure/fluid overload in radiology reports 
(accuracy 86.1%±0.5%) and echocardiogram notes (accuracy 98.4%±0.3%). A test set 
of 300 cases, which was blindly and independently labeled for ARDS by two groups 
of clinicians, shows that ARDSFlag generates an overall accuracy of 89.0% 
(specificity = 91.7%, recall = 80.3%, and precision = 75.0%) in detecting ARDS 
cases.
CONCLUSION: To our best knowledge, this is the first study to focus on 
developing a method to automate the detection of ARDS. Some studies have 
developed and used other methods to answer other research questions. Expectedly, 
ARDSFlag generates a significantly higher performance in all accuracy measures 
compared to those methods.

Background: Extubation failure (EF) can lead to an increased chance of 
ventilator-associated pneumonia, longer hospital stays, and a higher mortality 
rate. This study aimed to develop and validate an accurate machine-learning 
model to predict EF in intensive care units (ICUs). Methods: Patients who 
underwent extubation in the Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care 
(MIMIC)-IV database were included. EF was defined as the need for ventilatory 
support (non-invasive ventilation or reintubation) or death within 48 h 
following extubation. A machine-learning model called Categorical Boosting 
(CatBoost) was developed based on 89 clinical and laboratory variables. SHapley 
Additive exPlanations (SHAP) values were calculated to evaluate feature 
importance and the recursive feature elimination (RFE) algorithm was used to 
select key features. Hyperparameter optimization was conducted using an 
automated machine-learning toolkit (Neural Network Intelligence). The final 
model was trained based on key features and compared with 10 other models. The 
model was then prospectively validated in patients enrolled in the Cardiac 
Surgical ICU of Zhongshan Hospital, Fudan University. In addition, a web-based 
tool was developed to help clinicians use our model. Results: Of 16,189 patients 
included in the MIMIC-IV cohort, 2,756 (17.0%) had EF. Nineteen key features 
were selected using the RFE algorithm, including age, body mass index, stroke, 
heart rate, respiratory rate, mean arterial pressure, peripheral oxygen 
saturation, temperature, pH, central venous pressure, tidal volume, positive 
end-expiratory pressure, mean airway pressure, pressure support ventilation 
(PSV) level, mechanical ventilation (MV) durations, spontaneous breathing trial 
success times, urine output, crystalloid amount, and antibiotic types. After 
hyperparameter optimization, our model had the greatest area under the receiver 
operating characteristic (AUROC: 0.835) in internal validation. Significant 
differences in mortality, reintubation rates, and NIV rates were shown between 
patients with a high predicted risk and those with a low predicted risk. In the 
prospective validation, the superiority of our model was also observed (AUROC: 
0.803). According to the SHAP values, MV duration and PSV level were the most 
important features for prediction. Conclusions: In conclusion, this study 
developed and prospectively validated a CatBoost model, which better predicted 
EF in ICUs than other models.

BACKGROUND: Sepsis-associated acute kidney injury (SA-AKI) is a severe 
complication associated with poorer prognosis and increased mortality, 
particularly in elderly patients. Currently, there is a lack of accurate 
mortality risk prediction models for these patients in clinic.
OBJECTIVES: This study aimed to develop and validate machine learning models for 
predicting in-hospital mortality risk in elderly patients with SA-AKI.
METHODS: Machine learning models were developed and validated using the public, 
high-quality Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care (MIMIC)-IV critically 
ill database. The recursive feature elimination (RFE) algorithm was employed for 
key feature selection. Eleven predictive models were compared, with the best one 
selected for further validation. Shapley Additive Explanations (SHAP) values 
were used for visualization and interpretation, making the machine learning 
models clinically interpretable.
RESULTS: There were 16,154 patients with SA-AKI in the MIMIC-IV database, and 
8426 SA-AKI patients were included in this study (median age: 77.0 years; 
female: 45%). 7728 patients excluded based on these criteria. They were randomly 
divided into a training cohort (5,934, 70%) and a validation cohort (2,492, 
30%). Nine key features were selected by the RFE algorithm. The CatBoost model 
achieved the best performance, with an AUC of 0.844 in the training cohort and 
0.804 in the validation cohort. SHAP values revealed that AKI stage, PaO2, and 
lactate were the top three most important features contributing to the CatBoost 
model.
CONCLUSION: We developed a model capable of predicting the risk of in-hospital 
mortality in elderly patients with SA-AKI.

BACKGROUND: Persistent critical illness (PerCI) is an immunosuppressive status. 
The underlying pathophysiology driving PerCI remains incompletely understood. 
The objectives of the study were to identify the biological signature of PerCI 
development, and to construct a reliable prediction model for patients who had 
suffered orthopedic trauma using machine learning techniques.
METHODS: This study enrolled 1257 patients from the Medical Information Mart for 
Intensive Care III (MIMIC-III) database. Lymphocytes were tracked from ICU 
admission to more than 20 days following admission to examine the dynamic 
changes over time. Over 40 possible variables were gathered for investigation. 
Patients were split 80:20 at random into a training cohort (n=1035) and an 
internal validation cohort (n=222). Four machine learning algorithms, including 
random forest, gradient boosting machine, decision tree, and support vector 
machine, and a logistic regression technique were utilized to train and optimize 
models using data from the training cohort. Patients in the internal validation 
cohort were used to validate models, and the optimal one was chosen. Patients 
from two large teaching hospitals were used for external validation (n=113). The 
key metrics that used to assess the prediction performance of models mainly 
included discrimination, calibration, and clinical usefulness. To encourage 
clinical application based on the optimal machine learning-based model, a 
web-based calculator was developed.
RESULTS: 16.0% (201/1257) of all patients had PerCI in the MIMIC-III database. 
The means of lymphocytes (%) were consistently below the normal reference range 
across the time among PerCI patients (around 10.0%), whereas in patients without 
PerCI, the number of lymphocytes continued to increase and began to be in normal 
range on day 10 following ICU admission. Subgroup analysis demonstrated that 
patients with PerCI were in a more serious health condition at admission since 
those patients had worse nutritional status, more electrolyte imbalance and 
infection-related comorbidities, and more severe illness scores. Eight 
variables, including albumin, serum calcium, red cell volume distributing width 
(RDW), blood pH, heart rate, respiratory failure, pneumonia, and the 
Sepsis-related Organ Failure Assessment (SOFA) score, were significantly 
associated with PerCI, according to the least absolute shrinkage and selection 
operator (LASSO) logistic regression model combined with the 10-fold 
cross-validation. These variables were all included in the modelling. In 
comparison to other algorithms, the random forest had the optimal prediction 
ability with the highest area under receiver operating characteristic (AUROC) 
(0.823, 95% CI: 0.757-0.889), highest Youden index (1.571), and lowest Brier 
score (0.107). The AUROC in the external validation cohort was also up to 0.800 
(95% CI: 0.688-0.912). Based on the risk stratification system, patients in the 
high-risk group had a 10.0-time greater chance of developing PerCI than those in 
the low-risk group. A web-based calculator was available at 
https://starxueshu-perci-prediction-main-9k8eof.streamlitapp.com/.
CONCLUSIONS: Patients with PerCI typically remain in an immunosuppressive 
status, but those without PerCI gradually regain normal immunity. The dynamic 
changes of lymphocytes can be a reliable biomarker for PerCI. This work 
developed a reliable model that may be helpful in improving early diagnosis and 
targeted intervention of PerCI. Beneficial interventions, such as improving 
nutritional status and immunity, maintaining electrolyte and acid-base balance, 
curbing infection, and promoting respiratory recovery, are early warranted to 
prevent the onset of PerCI, especially among patients in the high-risk group and 
those with a continuously low level of lymphocytes.

This study aimed to construct machine learning (ML) models for predicting 
prolonged length of stay (pLOS) in intensive care units (ICU) among general ICU 
patients. A multicenter database called eICU (Collaborative Research Database) 
was used for model derivation and internal validation, and the Medical 
Information Mart for Intensive Care (MIMIC) III database was used for external 
validation. We used four different ML methods (random forest, support vector 
machine, deep learning, and gradient boosting decision tree (GBDT)) to develop 
prediction models. The prediction performance of the four models were compared 
with the customized simplified acute physiology score (SAPS) II. The area under 
the receiver operation characteristic curve (AUROC), area under the 
precision-recall curve (AUPRC), estimated calibration index (ECI), and Brier 
score were used to measure performance. In internal validation, the GBDT model 
achieved the best overall performance (Brier score, 0.164), discrimination 
(AUROC, 0.742; AUPRC, 0.537), and calibration (ECI, 8.224). In external 
validation, the GBDT model also achieved the best overall performance (Brier 
score, 0.166), discrimination (AUROC, 0.747; AUPRC, 0.536), and calibration 
(ECI, 8.294). External validation showed that the calibration curve of the GBDT 
model was an optimal fit, and four ML models outperformed the customized SAPS II 
model. The GBDT-based pLOS-ICU prediction model had the best prediction 
performance among the five models on both internal and external datasets. 
Furthermore, it has the potential to assist ICU physicians to identify patients 
with pLOS-ICU risk and provide appropriate clinical interventions to improve 
patient outcomes.

OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to develop and validate a machine 
learning-based predictive model that predicts 90-day mortality in ICU trauma 
patients.
METHODS: Data of patients with severe trauma were extracted from the Medical 
Information Mart for Intensive Care III (MIMIC-III) database. The performances 
of mortality prediction models generated using nine machine learning extreme 
gradient boosting (XGBoost), logistic regression, random forest, AdaBoost, 
multilayer perceptron (MLP) neural networks, support vector machine (SVM), light 
gradient boosting machine (GBM), k nearest neighbors (KNN) and gaussian naive 
bayes (GNB). The performance of the model was evaluated in terms of 
discrimination, calibration and clinical application.
RESULTS: We found that the accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, PPV, NPV and F1 
score of our proposed XGBoost model were 82.8%, 79.7%, 77.6%, 51.2%, 91.5% and 
0.624, respectively. Among the nine models, the XGBoost model performed best. 
Compared with traditional logistic regression, the calibration curves of the 
XGBoost model and decision curve analysis (DCA) performed well.
CONCLUSION: Our study shows that the XGBoost model outperforms other machine 
learning models in predicting 90-day mortality in trauma patients. It can be 
used to assist clinicians in the early identification of mortality risk factors 
and early intervention to reduce mortality.

OBJECTIVE: To predict the 28-day mortality of critically ill, elderly patients 
with colorectal cancer (CRC) using five machine learning approaches.
METHODS: Data were extracted from the eICU Collaborative Research Database 
(eICU-CRD) (version 2.0) for a training cohort and from the Medical Information 
Mart for Intensive Care-IV (MIMIC-IV) and Wuhan Union hospital for validation 
cohorts. Clinical information (i.e., demographics; initial laboratory tests; 
vital signs; outcomes) were collected. Five machine learning algorithms 
(LightGBM, decision tree, XGBoost, random forest, and ensemble model) and a 
logistic regression were applied for the prediction of 28-day mortality.
RESULTS: Overall, 693 patients were included from the eICU cohort, 181 patients 
from the MIMIC-IV cohort and 95 from the Wuhan Union cohort. Among the six 
machine learning models, the ensemble model exhibited the best predictive 
ability (AUC, 0.86), followed by random forest (AUC, 0.83) and LightGBM (AUC, 
0.82) in the training cohort. The models also obtained the good predictive 
performance for the 28-day mortality in the validation cohorts.
CONCLUSIONS: We showed that machine learning algorithms can be used for the 
28-day mortality prediction in critically ill, elderly patients with CRC.

BACKGROUND: Diabetes mellitus is a prevalent metabolic disease characterized by 
chronic hyperglycemia. The avalanche of healthcare data is accelerating 
precision and personalized medicine. Artificial intelligence and algorithm-based 
approaches are becoming more and more vital to support clinical decision-making. 
These methods are able to augment health care providers by taking away some of 
their routine work and enabling them to focus on critical issues. However, few 
studies have used predictive modeling to uncover associations between 
comorbidities in ICU patients and diabetes. This study aimed to use Unified 
Medical Language System (UMLS) resources, involving machine learning and natural 
language processing (NLP) approaches to predict the risk of mortality.
METHODS: We conducted a secondary analysis of Medical Information Mart for 
Intensive Care III (MIMIC-III) data. Different machine learning modeling and NLP 
approaches were applied. Domain knowledge in health care is built on the 
dictionaries created by experts who defined the clinical terminologies such as 
medications or clinical symptoms. This knowledge is valuable to identify 
information from text notes that assert a certain disease. Knowledge-guided 
models can automatically extract knowledge from clinical notes or biomedical 
literature that contains conceptual entities and relationships among these 
various concepts. Mortality classification was based on the combination of 
knowledge-guided features and rules. UMLS entity embedding and convolutional 
neural network (CNN) with word embeddings were applied. Concept Unique 
Identifiers (CUIs) with entity embeddings were utilized to build clinical text 
representations.
RESULTS: The best configuration of the employed machine learning models yielded 
a competitive AUC of 0.97. Machine learning models along with NLP of clinical 
notes are promising to assist health care providers to predict the risk of 
mortality of critically ill patients.
CONCLUSION: UMLS resources and clinical notes are powerful and important tools 
to predict mortality in diabetic patients in the critical care setting. The 
knowledge-guided CNN model is effective (AUC = 0.97) for learning hidden 
features.

BACKGROUND: In-hospital mortality, prolonged length of stay (LOS), and 30-day 
readmission are common outcomes in the intensive care unit (ICU). Traditional 
scoring systems and machine learning models for predicting these outcomes 
usually ignore the characteristics of ICU data, which are time-series forms. We 
aimed to use time-series deep learning models with the selective combination of 
three widely used scoring systems to predict these outcomes.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: A retrospective cohort study was conducted on 40,083 
patients in ICU from the Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care-IV 
(MIMIC-IV) database. Three deep learning models, namely, recurrent neural 
network (RNN), gated recurrent unit (GRU), and long short-term memory (LSTM) 
with attention mechanisms, were trained for the prediction of in-hospital 
mortality, prolonged LOS, and 30-day readmission with variables collected during 
the initial 24 h after ICU admission or the last 24 h before discharge. The 
inclusion of variables was based on three widely used scoring systems, namely, 
APACHE II, SOFA, and SAPS II, and the predictors consisted of time-series vital 
signs, laboratory tests, medication, and procedures. The patients were randomly 
divided into a training set (80%) and a test set (20%), which were used for 
model development and model evaluation, respectively. The area under the 
receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC), sensitivity, specificity, and 
Brier scores were used to evaluate model performance. Variable significance was 
identified through attention mechanisms.
RESULTS: A total of 33 variables for 40,083 patients were enrolled for mortality 
and prolonged LOS prediction and 36,180 for readmission prediction. The rates of 
occurrence of the three outcomes were 9.74%, 27.54%, and 11.79%, respectively. 
In each of the three outcomes, the performance of RNN, GRU, and LSTM did not 
differ greatly. Mortality prediction models, prolonged LOS prediction models, 
and readmission prediction models achieved AUCs of 0.870 ± 0.001, 0.765 ± 0.003, 
and 0.635 ± 0.018, respectively. The top significant variables co-selected by 
the three deep learning models were Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS), age, blood urea 
nitrogen, and norepinephrine for mortality; GCS, invasive ventilation, and blood 
urea nitrogen for prolonged LOS; and blood urea nitrogen, GCS, and ethnicity for 
readmission.
CONCLUSION: The prognostic prediction models established in our study achieved 
good performance in predicting common outcomes of patients in ICU, especially in 
mortality prediction. In addition, GCS and blood urea nitrogen were identified 
as the most important factors strongly associated with adverse ICU events.

BACKGROUND: A backdoor attack controls the output of a machine learning model in 
2 stages. First, the attacker poisons the training data set, introducing a back 
door into the victim's trained model. Second, during test time, the attacker 
adds an imperceptible pattern called a trigger to the input values, which forces 
the victim's model to output the attacker's intended values instead of true 
predictions or decisions. While backdoor attacks pose a serious threat to the 
reliability of machine learning-based medical diagnostics, existing backdoor 
attacks that directly change the input values are detectable relatively easily.
OBJECTIVE: The goal of this study was to propose and study a robust backdoor 
attack on mortality-prediction machine learning models that use electronic 
health records. We showed that our backdoor attack grants attackers full control 
over classification outcomes for safety-critical tasks such as mortality 
prediction, highlighting the importance of undertaking safe artificial 
intelligence research in the medical field.
METHODS: We present a trigger generation method based on missing patterns in 
electronic health record data. Compared to existing approaches, which introduce 
noise into the medical record, the proposed backdoor attack makes it simple to 
construct backdoor triggers without prior knowledge. To effectively avoid 
detection by manual inspectors, we employ variational autoencoders to learn the 
missing patterns in normal electronic health record data and produce trigger 
data that appears similar to this data.
RESULTS: We experimented with the proposed backdoor attack on 4 machine learning 
models (linear regression, multilayer perceptron, long short-term memory, and 
gated recurrent units) that predict in-hospital mortality using a public 
electronic health record data set. The results showed that the proposed 
technique achieved a significant drop in the victim's discrimination performance 
(reducing the area under the precision-recall curve by at most 0.45), with a low 
poisoning rate (2%) in the training data set. In addition, the impact of the 
attack on general classification performance was negligible (it reduced the area 
under the precision-recall curve by an average of 0.01025), which makes it 
difficult to detect the presence of poison.
CONCLUSIONS: To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study to propose a 
backdoor attack that uses missing information from tabular data as a trigger. 
Through extensive experiments, we demonstrated that our backdoor attack can 
inflict severe damage on medical machine learning classifiers in practice.

OBJECTIVE: As data science and artificial intelligence continue to rapidly gain 
traction, the publication of freely available ICU datasets has become invaluable 
to propel data-driven clinical research. In this guide for clinicians and 
researchers, we aim to: 1) systematically search and identify all publicly 
available adult clinical ICU datasets, 2) compare their characteristics, data 
quality, and richness and critically appraise their strengths and weaknesses, 
and 3) provide researchers with suggestions, which datasets are appropriate for 
answering their clinical question.
DATA SOURCES: A systematic search was performed in Pubmed, ArXiv, MedRxiv, and 
BioRxiv.
STUDY SELECTION: We selected all studies that reported on publicly available 
adult patient-level intensive care datasets.
DATA EXTRACTION: A total of four publicly available, adult, critical care, 
patient-level databases were included (Amsterdam University Medical Center data 
base [AmsterdamUMCdb], eICU Collaborative Research Database eICU CRD], High 
time-resolution intensive care unit dataset [HiRID], and Medical Information 
Mart for Intensive Care-IV). Databases were compared using a priori defined 
categories, including demographics, patient characteristics, and data richness. 
The study protocol and search strategy were prospectively registered.
DATA SYNTHESIS: Four ICU databases fulfilled all criteria for inclusion and were 
queried using SQL (PostgreSQL version 12; PostgreSQL Global Development Group) 
and analyzed using R (R Foundation for Statistical Computing, Vienna, Austria). 
The number of unique patient admissions varied between 23,106 (AmsterdamUMCdb) 
and 200,859 (eICU-CRD). Frequency of laboratory values and vital signs was 
highest in HiRID, for example, 5.2 (±3.4) lactate values per day and 29.7 
(±10.2) systolic blood pressure values per hour. Treatment intensity varied with 
vasopressor and ventilatory support in 69.0% and 83.0% of patients in 
AmsterdamUMCdb versus 12.0% and 21.0% in eICU-CRD, respectively. ICU mortality 
ranged from 5.5% in eICU-CRD to 9.9% in AmsterdamUMCdb.
CONCLUSIONS: We identified four publicly available adult clinical ICU datasets. 
Sample size, severity of illness, treatment intensity, and frequency of reported 
parameters differ markedly between the databases. This should guide clinicians 
and researchers which databases to best answer their clinical questions.

OBJECTIVES: Diagnosis and management of intensive care unit (ICU)-acquired 
bloodstream infections are often based on positive blood culture results. This 
retrospective cohort study aimed to develop a classification model using 
data-driven characterisation to optimise the management of intensive care 
patients with blood cultures.
SETTING, METHODOLOGY/DESIGN: An unsupervised clustering model was developed 
based on the clinical characteristics of patients with blood cultures in the 
Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care (MIMIC)-IV database (n = 2451). It 
was tested using the data from the MIMIC-III database (n = 2047).
MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: The prognosis, blood culture outcomes, antimicrobial 
interventions, and trajectories of infection indicators were compared between 
clusters.
RESULTS: Four clusters were identified using machine learning-based k-means 
clustering based on data obtained 48 h before the first blood culture sampling. 
Cluster γ was associated with the highest 28-day mortality rate, followed by 
clusters α, δ, and β. Cluster γ had a higher fungal isolation rate than cluster 
β (P < 0.05). Cluster δ was associated with a higher isolation rate of 
Gram-negative organisms and fungi (P < 0.05). Patients in clusters γ and δ 
underwent more femoral site vein catheter placements than those in cluster β 
(P < 0.001, all). Patients with a duration of antibiotics treatment of 4, 6, and 
7 days in clusters α, δ, and γ, respectively, had the lowest 28-day mortality 
rate.
CONCLUSIONS: Machine learning identified four clusters of intensive care 
patients with blood cultures, which yielded different prognoses, blood culture 
outcomes, and optimal duration of antibiotic treatment. Such data-driven blood 
culture classifications suggest further investigation should be undertaken to 
optimise treatment and improve care.
IMPLICATIONS FOR CLINICAL PRACTICE: Intensive care unit-acquired bloodstream 
infections are heterogeneous. Meaningful classifications associated with 
outcomes should be described. Using machine learning and cluster analysis could 
help in understanding heterogeneity. Data-driven blood culture classification 
could identify distinct physiological states and prognoses before deciding on 
blood culture sampling, optimise treatment, and improve care.

BACKGROUND: Vancomycin pharmacokinetics are highly variable in patients with 
critical illnesses, and clinicians commonly use population pharmacokinetic (PPK) 
models based on a Bayesian approach to dose. However, these models are 
population-dependent, may only sometimes meet the needs of individual patients, 
and are only used by experienced clinicians as a reference for making treatment 
decisions. To assist real-world clinicians, we developed a deep learning-based 
decision-making system that predicts vancomycin therapeutic drug monitoring 
(TDM) levels in patients in intensive care unit.
OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to establish joint multilayer perceptron (JointMLP), 
a new deep-learning model for predicting vancomycin TDM levels, and compare its 
performance with the PPK models, extreme gradient boosting (XGBoost), and 
TabNet.
METHODS: We used a 977-case data set split into training and testing groups in a 
9:1 ratio. We performed external validation of the model using 1429 cases from 
Kangwon National University Hospital and 2394 cases from the Medical Information 
Mart for Intensive Care-IV (MIMIC-IV). In addition, we performed 10-fold 
cross-validation on the internal training data set and calculated the 95% CIs 
using the metric. Finally, we evaluated the generalization ability of the 
JointMLP model using the MIMIC-IV data set.
RESULTS: Our JointMLP model outperformed other models in predicting vancomycin 
TDM levels in internal and external data sets. Compared to PPK, the JointMLP 
model improved predictive power by up to 31% (mean absolute error [MAE] 6.68 vs 
5.11) on the internal data set and 81% (MAE 11.87 vs 6.56) on the external data 
set. In addition, the JointMLP model significantly outperforms XGBoost and 
TabNet, with a 13% (MAE 5.75 vs 5.11) and 14% (MAE 5.85 vs 5.11) improvement in 
predictive accuracy on the inner data set, respectively. On both the internal 
and external data sets, our JointMLP model performed well compared to XGBoost 
and TabNet, achieving prediction accuracy improvements of 34% and 14%, 
respectively. Additionally, our JointMLP model showed higher robustness to 
outlier data than the other models, as evidenced by its higher root mean squared 
error performance across all data sets. The mean errors and variances of the 
JointMLP model were close to zero and smaller than those of the PPK model in 
internal and external data sets.
CONCLUSIONS: Our JointMLP approach can help optimize treatment outcomes in 
patients with critical illnesses in an intensive care unit setting, reducing 
side effects associated with suboptimal vancomycin administration. These include 
increased risk of bacterial resistance, extended hospital stays, and increased 
health care costs. In addition, the superior performance of our model compared 
to existing models highlights its potential to help real-world clinicians.

Sepsis is a major cause of mortality among hospitalized patients. Existing 
sepsis prediction methods face limitations due to their reliance on laboratory 
results and Electronic Medical Records (EMRs). This work aimed to develop a 
sepsis prediction model utilizing continuous vital signs monitoring, offering an 
innovative approach to sepsis prediction. Data from 48,886 Intensive Care Unit 
(ICU) patient stays were extracted from the Medical Information Mart for 
Intensive Care -IV dataset. A machine learning model was developed to predict 
sepsis onset based solely on vital signs. The model's efficacy was compared with 
the existing scoring systems of SIRS, qSOFA, and a Logistic Regression model. 
The machine learning model demonstrated superior performance at 6 hrs prior to 
sepsis onset, achieving 88.1% sensitivity and 81.3% specificity, surpassing 
existing scoring systems. This novel approach offers clinicians a timely 
assessment of patients' likelihood of developing sepsis.

BACKGROUND: Invasive mechanical ventilation plays an important role in the 
prognosis of patients with sepsis. However, there are, currently, no tools 
specifically designed to assess weaning from invasive mechanical ventilation in 
patients with sepsis. The aim of our study was to develop a practical model to 
predict weaning in patients with sepsis.
METHODS: We extracted patient information from the Medical Information Mart for 
Intensive Care Database-IV (MIMIC-IV) and the eICU Collaborative Research 
Database (eICU-CRD). Kaplan-Meier curves were plotted to compare the 28-day 
mortality between patients who successfully weaned and those who failed to wean. 
Subsequently, MIMIC-IV was divided into a training set and an internal 
verification set, and the eICU-CRD was designated as the external verification 
set. We selected the best model to simplify the internal and external validation 
sets based on the performance of the model.
RESULTS: A total of 5020 and 7081 sepsis patients with invasive mechanical 
ventilation in MIMIC-IV and eICU-CRD were included, respectively. After 
matching, weaning was independently associated with 28-day mortality and length 
of ICU stay (p < 0.001 and p = 0.002, respectively). After comparison, 35 
clinical variables were extracted to build weaning models. XGBoost performed the 
best discrimination among the models in the internal and external validation 
sets (AUROC: 0.80 and 0.86, respectively). Finally, a simplified model was 
developed based on XGBoost, which included only four variables. The simplified 
model also had good predictive performance (AUROC:0.75 and 0.78 in internal and 
external validation sets, respectively) and was developed into a web-based tool 
for further review.
CONCLUSIONS: Weaning success is independently related to short-term mortality in 
patients with sepsis. The simplified model based on the XGBoost algorithm 
provides good predictive performance and great clinical applicablity for 
weaning, and a web-based tool was developed for better clinical application.

Objective.Noninvasive blood pressure (BP) measurement technologies have been 
widely studied, but they still have the disadvantages of low accuracy, the 
requirement for frequent calibration and limited subjects. This work considers 
the regulation of vascular activity by the sympathetic nervous system and 
proposes a method for estimating BP using multiple physiological 
parameters.Approach.The parameters used in the model consist of heart rate 
variability (HRV), pulse transit time (PTT) and pulse wave morphology features 
extracted from electrocardiogram (ECG) and photoplethysmogram (PPG) signals. 
Through four classic machine learning algorithms, a hybrid data set of 3337 
subjects from two databases is evaluated to verify the ability of cross-database 
migration. We also recommend an individual calibration procedure to further 
improve the accuracy of the method.Main results.The mean absolute error (MAE) 
and the root mean square error (RMSE) of the proposed algorithm is 10.03 and 
14.55 mmHg for systolic BP (SBP), and 5.42 and 8.19 mmHg for diastolic BP (DBP). 
With individual calibration, the MAE and standard deviation (SD) is -0.16 ± 7.96 
(SBP) and -0.13 ± 4.50 (DBP) mmHg, which satisfied the Advancement of Medical 
Instrumentation (AAMI) standard. In addition, the models are used to test single 
databases to evaluate their performance on different data sources. The overall 
performance of the Adaboost algorithm is better on the Multi-parameter 
Intelligent Monitoring in Intensive Care Unit (MIMIC) database; the MAE between 
its predicted value and true value reaches 6.6mmHg (SBP) and 3.12mmHg (DBP), 
respectively.Significance.The proposed method considers the regulation of blood 
vessels and the heart by the autonomic nervous system, and verifies its 
effectiveness and robustness across data sources, which is promising for 
improving the accuracy of continuous and cuffless BP estimation.

Predicting clinical patients' vital signs is a leading critical issue in 
intensive care units (ICUs) related studies. Early prediction of the mortality 
of ICU patients can reduce the overall mortality and cost of complication 
treatment. Some studies have predicted mortality based on electronic health 
record (EHR) data by using machine learning models. However, the semi-structured 
data (i.e., patients' diagnosis data and inspection reports) is rarely used in 
these models. This study utilized data from the Medical Information Mart for 
Intensive Care III. We used a Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) model to 
classify text in the semi-structured data of some particular topics and 
established and compared the classification and regression trees (CART), 
logistic regression (LR), multivariate adaptive regression splines (MARS), 
random forest (RF), and gradient boosting (GB). A total of 46,520 ICU Patients 
were included, with 11.5% mortality in the Medical Information Mart for 
Intensive Care III group. Our results revealed that the semi-structured data 
(diagnosis data and inspection reports) of ICU patients contain useful 
information that can assist clinical doctors in making critical clinical 
decisions. In addition, in our comparison of five machine learning models (CART, 
LR, MARS, RF, and GB), the GB model showed the best performance with the highest 
area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUROC) (0.9280), 
specificity (93.16%), and sensitivity (83.25%). The RF, LR, and MARS models 
showed better performance (AUROC are 0.9096, 0.8987, and 0.8935, respectively) 
than the CART (0.8511). The GB model showed better performance than other

OBJECTIVES: There are many studies of acute kidney injury (AKI) diagnosis models 
lack of external validation and prospective validation. We constructed the 
models using three databases to predict severe AKI within 48 hours in intensive 
care unit (ICU) patients.
DESIGN: A retrospective and prospective cohort study.
SETTING: We studied critically ill patients in our database (SHZJU-ICU) and two 
other public databases, the Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care (MIMIC) 
and AmsterdamUMC databases, including basic demographics, vital signs and 
laboratory results. We predicted the diagnosis of severe AKI in patients in the 
next 48 hours using machine-learning algorithms with the three databases. Then, 
we carried out real-time severe AKI prediction in the prospective validation 
study at our centre for 1 year.
PARTICIPANTS: All patients included in three databases with uniform exclusion 
criteria.
PRIMARY AND SECONDARY OUTCOME MEASURES: Effect evaluation index of prediction 
models.
RESULTS: We included 58 492 patients, and a total of 5257 (9.0%) patients met 
the definition of severe AKI. In the internal validation of the SHZJU-ICU and 
MIMIC databases, the best area under the receiver operating characteristic curve 
(AUROC) of the model was 0.86. The external validation results by AmsterdamUMC 
database were also satisfactory, with the best AUROC of 0.86. A total of 2532 
patients were admitted to the centre for prospective validation; 358 positive 
results were predicted and 344 patients were diagnosed with severe AKI, with the 
best sensitivity of 0.72, the specificity of 0.80 and the AUROC of 0.84.
CONCLUSION: The prediction model of severe AKI exhibits promises as a clinical 
application based on dynamic vital signs and laboratory results of multicentre 
databases with prospective and external validation.

BACKGROUND: Intensive care unit (ICU) resources are inadequate for the large 
population in China, so it is essential for physicians to evaluate the condition 
of patients at admission. In this study, our objective was to construct a 
machine-learning risk prediction model for mortality in respiratory intensive 
care units (RICUs).
METHODS: This study involved 817 patients who made 1,063 visits and who were 
admitted to the RICU from 2012 to 2017. Potential predictors such as demographic 
information, laboratory results, vital signs and clinical characteristics were 
considered. We constructed eXtreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost) models and 
compared performances with random forest models, logistic regression models and 
clinical scores such as Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation II 
(APACHE II) and the sequential organ failure assessment (SOFA) system. The model 
was externally validated using data from Medical Information Mart for Intensive 
Care (MIMIC-III) database. A web-based calculator was developed for practical 
use.
RESULTS: Among the 1,063 visits, the RICU mortality rate was 13.5%. The XGBoost 
model achieved the best performance with the area under the receiver operating 
characteristics curve (AUROC) of 0.860 (95% confidence interval (CI): 0.808 - 
0.909) in the test set, which was significantly greater than APACHE II (0.749, 
95% CI: 0.674 - 0.820; P = 0.015) and SOFA (0.751, 95% CI: 0.669 - 0.818; P = 
0.018). The Hosmer-Lemeshow test indicated a good calibration of our predictive 
model in the test set with a P-value of 0.176. In the external validation 
dataset, the AUROC of XGBoost model was 0.779 (95% CI: 0.714 - 0.813). The final 
model contained variables that were previously known to be associated with 
mortality, but it also included some features absent from the clinical scores. 
The mean N-terminal pro-B-type natriuretic peptide (NTproBNP) of survivors was 
significantly lower than that of the non-survival group (2066.43 pg/mL vs. 
8232.81 pg/mL; P < 0.001).
CONCLUSIONS: Our results showed that the XGBoost model could be a suitable model 
for predicting RICU mortality with easy-to-collect variables at admission and 
help intensivists improve clinical decision-making for RICU patients. We found 
that higher NT-proBNP can be a good indicator of poor prognosis.

BACKGROUND: Scalable and accurate health outcome prediction using electronic 
health record (EHR) data has gained much attention in research recently. 
Previous machine learning models mostly ignore relations between different types 
of clinical data (ie, laboratory components, International Classification of 
Diseases codes, and medications).
OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to model such relations and build predictive models 
using the EHR data from intensive care units. We developed innovative neural 
network models and compared them with the widely used logistic regression model 
and other state-of-the-art neural network models to predict the patient's 
mortality using their longitudinal EHR data.
METHODS: We built a set of neural network models that we collectively called as 
long short-term memory (LSTM) outcome prediction using comprehensive feature 
relations or in short, CLOUT. Our CLOUT models use a correlational neural 
network model to identify a latent space representation between different types 
of discrete clinical features during a patient's encounter and integrate the 
latent representation into an LSTM-based predictive model framework. In 
addition, we designed an ablation experiment to identify risk factors from our 
CLOUT models. Using physicians' input as the gold standard, we compared the risk 
factors identified by both CLOUT and logistic regression models.
RESULTS: Experiments on the Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care-III 
dataset (selected patient population: 7537) show that CLOUT (area under the 
receiver operating characteristic curve=0.89) has surpassed logistic regression 
(0.82) and other baseline NN models (<0.86). In addition, physicians' agreement 
with the CLOUT-derived risk factor rankings was statistically significantly 
higher than the agreement with the logistic regression model.
CONCLUSIONS: Our results support the applicability of CLOUT for real-world 
clinical use in identifying patients at high risk of mortality.

BACKGROUND: This study aimed to establish and validate a machine learning (ML) 
model for predicting in-hospital mortality in critically ill patients with 
chronic kidney disease (CKD).
METHODS: This study collected data on CKD patients from 2008 to 2019 using the 
Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care IV. Six ML approaches were used to 
build the model. Accuracy and area under the curve (AUC) were used to choose the 
best model. In addition, the best model was interpreted using SHapley Additive 
exPlanations (SHAP) values.
RESULTS: There were 8527 CKD patients eligible for participation; the median age 
was 75.1 (interquartile range: 65.0-83.5) years, and 61.7% (5259/8527) were 
male. We developed six ML models with clinical variables as input factors. Among 
the six models developed, the eXtreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost) model had the 
highest AUC, at 0.860. According to the SHAP values, the sequential organ 
failure assessment score, urine output, respiratory rate, and simplified acute 
physiology score II were the four most influential variables in the XGBoost 
model.
CONCLUSIONS: In conclusion, we successfully developed and validated ML models 
for predicting mortality in critically ill patients with CKD. Among all ML 
models, the XGBoost model is the most effective ML model that can help 
clinicians accurately manage and implement early interventions, which may reduce 
mortality in critically ill CKD patients with a high risk of death.

BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Accurately predicting length of stay (LOS) is considered a 
challenging task for health care systems globally. In previous studies on LOS 
range prediction, researchers commonly pre-classified the LOS ranges, which were 
the same for all patients in the same classification, and then utilized a 
classifier for prediction. In this study, we innovatively aimed to predict the 
specific LOS range for each patient (the LOS range was different for each 
patient).
METHODS: In the modified deep neural network (DNN), the overall sample error 
(root mean square error (RMSE) method), the estimated sample error (ERRpred 
method), the probability distribution with different loss functions 
(Dispred_Loss1, Dispred_Loss2, and Dispred_Loss3 method), and the generative 
adversarial networks (WGAN-GP for LOS method) are used for LOS range prediction. 
The Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care III (MIMIC-III) database is used 
to validate these methods.
RESULTS: The RMSE method is convenient for LOS range prediction, but the 
predicted ranges are all consistent in the same batch of samples. The ERRpred 
method can achieve better prediction results in samples with low errors. 
However, the prediction effect is worse in samples with larger errors. The 
Dispred_Loss1 method encounters a training instability problem. The 
Dispred_Loss2 and Dispred_Loss3 methods perform well in making predictions. 
Although WGAN-GP for LOS method does not show a substantial advantage over other 
methods, this method might have the potential to improve the predictive 
performance.
CONCLUSION: The results show that it is possible to achieve an acceptable 
accurate LOS range prediction through a reasonable model design, which may help 
physicians in the clinic.

INTRODUCTION: Linezolid is an antimicrobial with broad activity against 
Gram-positive bacteria. Thrombocytopenia is one of its most common side effects 
often leading to severe complications. The aim of this study is to identify 
factors related with development of this condition in critically ill patients 
and to develop and evaluate a predictive machine learning-based model 
considering easy-to-obtain clinical variables.
METHODS: Data was obtained from the Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care 
III. Patients who received linezolid for over three days were considered, 
excluding those under 18 years and/or lacking laboratory data. Thrombocytopenia 
was considered as a platelet decrease of at least 50% from baseline.
RESULTS: Three hundred and twenty patients met inclusion criteria of which 63 
developed thrombocytopenia and presented significant greater duration of 
treatment, aspartate-aminotransferase, bilirubin and international normalized 
ratio; and lower renal clearance and platelet count at baseline. 
Thrombocytopenia development was associated with a worse outcome (30 days 
mortality [OR: 2.77; CI95%: 1.87-5.89; P < .001], 60 days mortality [OR: 3.56; 
CI95%: 2.18-7.26; P < .001]). Thrombocytopenia was also correlated with higher 
length of hospital stays (35.56 [20.40-52.99] vs 22.69 [10.05-38.61]; P < .001). 
Median time until this anomaly was of 23 days (CI95%:19.0-NE). Two multivariate 
models were performed. Accuracy, sensitivity, specificity and AUROC obtained in 
the best of them were of 0.75, 0.78, 0.62 and 0.80, respectively.
CONCLUSION: Linezolid associated thrombocytopenia entails greater mortality 
rates and hospital stays. Although the proposed predictive model has to be 
subsequently validated in a real clinical setting, its application could 
identify patients at risk and establish screening and surveillance strategies.

BACKGROUND: The lack of transparency is a prevalent issue among the current 
machine-learning (ML) algorithms utilized for predicting mortality risk. Herein, 
we aimed to improve transparency by utilizing the latest ML explicable 
technology, SHapley Additive exPlanation (SHAP), to develop a predictive model 
for critically ill patients.
METHODS: We extracted data from the Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care 
IV database, encompassing all intensive care unit admissions. We employed nine 
different methods to develop the models. The most accurate model, with the 
highest area under the receiver operating characteristic curve, was selected as 
the optimal model. Additionally, we used SHAP to explain the workings of the ML 
model.
RESULTS: The study included 21 395 critically ill patients, with a median age of 
68 years (interquartile range, 56-79 years), and most patients were male 
(56.9%). The cohort was randomly split into a training set (N = 16 046) and a 
validation set (N = 5349). Among the nine models developed, the Random Forest 
model had the highest accuracy (87.62%) and the best area under the receiver 
operating characteristic curve value (0.89). The SHAP summary analysis showed 
that Glasgow Coma Scale, urine output, and blood urea nitrogen were the top 
three risk factors for outcome prediction. Furthermore, SHAP dependency analysis 
and SHAP force analysis were used to interpret the Random Forest model at the 
factor level and individual level, respectively.
CONCLUSION: A transparent ML model for predicting outcomes in critically ill 
patients using SHAP methodology is feasible and effective. SHAP values 
significantly improve the explainability of ML models.

BACKGROUND: Among patients with acute respiratory failure requiring prolonged 
mechanical ventilation, tracheostomies are typically placed after approximately 
7 to 10 days. Yet half of patients admitted to the intensive care unit receiving 
tracheostomy will die within a year, often within three months. Existing 
mortality prediction models for prolonged mechanical ventilation, such as the 
ProVent Score, have poor sensitivity and are not applied until after 14 days of 
mechanical ventilation. We developed a model to predict 3-month mortality in 
patients requiring more than 7 days of mechanical ventilation using deep 
learning techniques and compared this to existing mortality models.
METHODS: Retrospective cohort study. Setting: The Medical Information Mart for 
Intensive Care III Database. Patients: All adults requiring ≥ 7 days of 
mechanical ventilation. Measurements: A neural network model for 3-month 
mortality was created using process-of-care variables, including demographic, 
physiologic and clinical data. The area under the receiver operator curve 
(AUROC) was compared to the ProVent model at predicting 3 and 12-month 
mortality. Shapley values were used to identify the variables with the greatest 
contributions to the model.
RESULTS: There were 4,334 encounters divided into a development cohort (n = 
3467) and a testing cohort (n = 867). The final deep learning model included 250 
variables and had an AUROC of 0.74 for predicting 3-month mortality at day 7 of 
mechanical ventilation versus 0.59 for the ProVent model. Older age and elevated 
Simplified Acute Physiology Score II (SAPS II) Score on intensive care unit 
admission had the largest contribution to predicting mortality.
DISCUSSION: We developed a deep learning prediction model for 3-month mortality 
among patients requiring ≥ 7 days of mechanical ventilation using a neural 
network approach utilizing readily available clinical variables. The model 
outperforms the ProVent model for predicting mortality among patients requiring 
≥ 7 days of mechanical ventilation. This model requires external validation.

OBJECTIVE(S): Using the Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care III 
(MIMIC-III) database, we compared the performance of machine learning (ML) to 
the to the established gold standard scoring tool (POAF Score) in predicting 
postoperative atrial fibrillation (POAF) during intensive care unit (ICU) 
admission after cardiac surgery.
METHODS: Random forest classifier (RF), decision tree classifier (DT), logistic 
regression (LR), K neighbours classifier (KNN), support vector machine (SVM), 
and gradient boosted machine (GBM) were compared to the POAF Score. 
Cross-validation was used to assess the area under the receiver operating 
characteristic curve (AUC), sensitivity, and specificity of ML models. POAF 
Score performance confidence intervals were generated using 1,000 bootstraps. 
Risk profiles for GBM were generated using Shapley additive values.
RESULTS: A total of 6,349 ICU admissions encompassing 6,040 patients were 
included. POAF occurred in 1,364 of the 6,349 admissions (21.5%). For predicting 
POAF during ICU admission after cardiac surgery, GBM, LR, RF, KNN, SVM and DT 
achieved an AUC of 0.74 (0.71-0.77), 0.73 (0.71-0.75), 0.72 (0.69-0.75), 0.68 
(0.67-0.69), 0.67 (0.66-0.68) and 0.59 (0.55-0.63) respectively. The POAF Score 
AUC was 0.63 (0.62-0.64). Shapley additive values analysis of GBM generated 
patient level explanations for each prediction.
CONCLUSION: Machine learning models based on readily available preoperative data 
can outperform clinical scoring tools for predicting POAF during ICU admission 
after cardiac surgery. Explanatory models are shown to have potential in 
personalising POAF risk profiles for patients by illustrating probabilistic 
input variable contributions. Future research is required to evaluate the 
clinical utility and safety of implementing ML-driven tools for POAF prediction.

The increased use of electronic health records (EHRs) has improved the 
availability of routine care data for medical research. Combined with machine 
learning techniques this has spurred the development of early warning scores 
(EWSs) in hospitals worldwide. EWSs are commonly used in the hospital where they 
have been developed, yet few have been transported to external settings and/or 
internationally. In this perspective, we describe our experiences in 
implementing the TREWScore, a septic shock EWS, and the transportability 
challenges regarding domain, predictors, and clinical outcome we faced. We used 
data of 53,330 ICU stays from Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care-III 
(MIMIC-III) and 18,013 ICU stays from the University Medical Center (UMC) 
Utrecht, including 17,023 (31.9%) and 2,557 (14.2%) cases of sepsis, 
respectively. The MIMIC-III and UMC populations differed significantly regarding 
the length of stay (6.9 vs. 9.0 days) and hospital mortality (11.6% vs. 13.6%). 
We mapped all 54 TREWScore predictors to the UMC database: 31 were readily 
available, seven required unit conversion, 14 had to be engineered, one 
predictor required text mining, and one predictor could not be mapped. Lastly, 
we classified sepsis cases for septic shock using the sepsis-2 criteria. Septic 
shock populations (UMC 31.3% and MIMIC-III 23.3%) and time to shock events 
showed significant differences between the two cohorts. In conclusion, we 
identified challenges to transportability and implementation regarding domain, 
predictors, and clinical outcome when transporting EWS between hospitals across 
two continents. These challenges need to be systematically addressed to improve 
model transportability between centers and unlock the potential clinical utility 
of EWS.

BACKGROUND: Acute kidney injury (AKI) is prevalent in patients with 
intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH) and is associated with mortality. This study 
aimed to verify the predictive accuracy of different machine learning algorithms 
for AKI in patients with ICH using a large dataset.
METHODS: A total of 1366 ICH patients received treatments between 2001 and 2012 
from the Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care-III (MIMIC-III) database 
were identified based on the ICD-9 code: 431. The main outcome of AKI during 
hospitalizations was confirmed based on the KDIGO criteria. Overall, ICH 
patients were randomly divided into the training cohort and validation cohort 
with the ratio of 7:3. Six machine learning algorithms including extreme 
gradient boosting, logistic, light gradient boosting machine, random forest, 
adaptive boosting, support vector machine were trained in the training cohort 
with the 5-fold cross-validation method to predict the AKI. The predictive 
accuracy of those algorithms was compared by area under the receiver operating 
characteristics curve (AUC).
RESULTS: A total of 1213 ICH patients were included with the incidence of AKI 
being 29.3%. The incidence of AKI was 29.3% among the 1213 patients with ICH. 
The AKI group had higher 30-day mortality (p<0.001), longer ICU stay (p<0.001), 
and longer hospital stay (p<0.001). Among the six machine learning algorithms, 
the random forest performed the best in predicting AKI in both the training 
cohort (AUC=1.000) and the validation cohort (AUC=0.698). The top five features 
in the random forest algorithm-based model were platelets, serum creatinine, 
vancomycin, hemoglobin, and hematocrit.
CONCLUSION: The random forest algorithm-based predictive model we developed 
incorporating important features, including platelet count, serum creatinine 
level, vancomycin level, hemoglobin level, and hematocrit level, performed the 
best in predicting AKI among patients with ICH.

Transforming raw EHR data into machine learning model-ready inputs requires 
considerable effort. One widely used EHR database is Medical Information Mart 
for Intensive Care (MIMIC). Prior work on MIMIC-III cannot query the updated and 
improved MIMIC-IV version. Besides, the need to use multicenter datasets further 
highlights the challenge of EHR data extraction. Therefore, we developed an 
extraction pipeline that works on both MIMIC-IV and eICU Collaborative Research 
Database and allows for model cross validation using these 2 databases. Under 
the default choices, the pipeline extracted 38,766 and 126,448 ICU records for 
MIMIC-IV and eICU, respectively. Using the extracted time-dependent variables, 
we compared the Area Under the Curve (AUC) performance with ​​prior works on 
clinically relevant tasks such as in-hospital mortality prediction. METRE 
achieved comparable performance with AUC 0.723-0.888 across all tasks with 
MIMIC-IV. Additionally, when we evaluated the model directly on MIMIC-IV data 
using a model trained on eICU, we observed that the AUC change can be as small 
as +0.019 or -0.015. Our open-source pipeline transforms MIMIC-IV and eICU into 
structured data frames and allows researchers to perform model training and 
testing using data collected from different institutions, which is of critical 
importance for model deployment under clinical contexts. The code used to 
extract the data and perform training is available here:

RESEARCH OBJECTIVES: Clostriodiodes difficile infection (CDI) is a major cause 
of healthcare-associated diarrhoea with high mortality. There is a lack of 
validated predictors for severe outcomes in CDI. The aim of this study is to 
derive and validate a clinical prediction tool for CDI in-hospital mortality 
using a large critical care database.
METHODOLOGY: The demographics, clinical parameters, laboratory results and 
mortality of CDI were extracted from the Medical Information Mart for Intensive 
Care-III (MIMIC-III) database. We subsequently trained three machine learning 
models: logistic regression (LR), random forest (RF) and gradient boosting 
machine (GBM) to predict in-hospital mortality. The individual performances of 
the models were compared against current severity scores (Clostridiodes 
difficile Associated Risk of Death Score (CARDS) and ATLAS (Age, Treatment with 
systemic antibiotics, leukocyte count, Albumin and Serum creatinine as a measure 
of renal function) by calculating area under receiver operating curve (AUROC). 
We identified factors associated with higher mortality risk in each model.
SUMMARY OF RESULTS: From 61 532 intensive care unit stays in the MIMIC-III 
database, there were 1315 CDI cases. The mortality rate for CDI in the study 
cohort was 18.33%. AUROC was 0.69 (95% CI, 0.60 to 0.76) for LR, 0.71 (95% CI, 
0.62 to 0.77) for RF and 0.72 (95% CI, 0.64 to 0.78) for GBM, while previously 
AUROC was 0.57 (95% CI, 0.51 to 0.65) for CARDS and 0.63 (95% CI, 0.54 to 0.70) 
for ATLAS. Albumin, lactate and bicarbonate were significant mortality factors 
for all the models. Free calcium, potassium, white blood cell, urea, platelet 
and mean blood pressure were present in at least two of the three models.
CONCLUSION: Our machine learning derived CDI in-hospital mortality prediction 
model identified pertinent factors that can assist critical care clinicians in 
identifying patients at high risk of dying from CDI.

BACKGROUND: Machine learning (ML) may improve clinical decision-making in 
critical care settings, but intrinsic biases in datasets can introduce bias into 
predictive models. This study aims to determine if publicly available critical 
care datasets provide relevant information to identify historically marginalized 
populations.
METHOD: We conducted a review to identify the manuscripts that report the 
training/validation of ML algorithms using publicly accessible critical care 
electronic medical record (EMR) datasets. The datasets were reviewed to 
determine if the following 12 variables were available: age, sex, gender 
identity, race and/or ethnicity, self-identification as an indigenous person, 
payor, primary language, religion, place of residence, education, occupation, 
and income.
RESULTS: 7 publicly available databases were identified. Medical Information 
Mart for Intensive Care (MIMIC) reports information on 7 of the 12 variables of 
interest, Sistema de Informação de Vigilância Epidemiológica da Gripe 
(SIVEP-Gripe) on 7, COVID-19 Mexican Open Repository on 4, and eICU on 4. Other 
datasets report information on 2 or fewer variables. All 7 databases included 
information about sex and age. Four databases (57%) included information about 
whether a patient identified as native or indigenous. Only 3 (43%) included data 
about race and/or ethnicity. Two databases (29%) included information about 
residence, and one (14%) included information about payor, language, and 
religion. One database (14%) included information about education and patient 
occupation. No databases included information on gender identity and income.
CONCLUSION: This review demonstrates that critical care publicly available data 
used to train AI algorithms do not include enough information to properly look 
for intrinsic bias and fairness issues towards historically marginalized 
populations.

BACKGROUND: Federated learning (FL) is a newly proposed machine-learning method 
that uses a decentralized dataset. Since data transfer is not necessary for the 
learning process in FL, there is a significant advantage in protecting personal 
privacy. Therefore, many studies are being actively conducted in the 
applications of FL for diverse areas.
OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to evaluate the reliability and performance 
of FL using three benchmark datasets, including a clinical benchmark dataset.
METHODS: To evaluate FL in a realistic setting, we implemented FL using a 
client-server architecture with Python. The implemented client-server version of 
the FL software was deployed to Amazon Web Services. Modified National Institute 
of Standards and Technology (MNIST), Medical Information Mart for Intensive 
Care-III (MIMIC-III), and electrocardiogram (ECG) datasets were used to evaluate 
the performance of FL. To test FL in a realistic setting, the MNIST dataset was 
split into 10 different clients, with one digit for each client. In addition, we 
conducted four different experiments according to basic, imbalanced, skewed, and 
a combination of imbalanced and skewed data distributions. We also compared the 
performance of FL to that of the state-of-the-art method with respect to 
in-hospital mortality using the MIMIC-III dataset. Likewise, we conducted 
experiments comparing basic and imbalanced data distributions using MIMIC-III 
and ECG data.
RESULTS: FL on the basic MNIST dataset with 10 clients achieved an area under 
the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUROC) of 0.997 and an F1-score of 
0.946. The experiment with the imbalanced MNIST dataset achieved an AUROC of 
0.995 and an F1-score of 0.921. The experiment with the skewed MNIST dataset 
achieved an AUROC of 0.992 and an F1-score of 0.905. Finally, the combined 
imbalanced and skewed experiment achieved an AUROC of 0.990 and an F1-score of 
0.891. The basic FL on in-hospital mortality using MIMIC-III data achieved an 
AUROC of 0.850 and an F1-score of 0.944, while the experiment with the 
imbalanced MIMIC-III dataset achieved an AUROC of 0.850 and an F1-score of 
0.943. For ECG classification, the basic FL achieved an AUROC of 0.938 and an 
F1-score of 0.807, and the imbalanced ECG dataset achieved an AUROC of 0.943 and 
an F1-score of 0.807.
CONCLUSIONS: FL demonstrated comparative performance on different benchmark 
datasets. In addition, FL demonstrated reliable performance in cases where the 
distribution was imbalanced, skewed, and extreme, reflecting the real-life 
scenario in which data distributions from various hospitals are different. FL 
can achieve high performance while maintaining privacy protection because there 
is no requirement to centralize the data.

BACKGROUND: Patient monitoring is vital in all stages of care. In particular, 
intensive care unit (ICU) patient monitoring has the potential to reduce 
complications and morbidity, and to increase the quality of care by enabling 
hospitals to deliver higher-quality, cost-effective patient care, and improve 
the quality of medical services in the ICU.
OBJECTIVE: We here report the development and validation of ICU length of stay 
and mortality prediction models. The models will be used in an intelligent ICU 
patient monitoring module of an Intelligent Remote Patient Monitoring (IRPM) 
framework that monitors the health status of patients, and generates timely 
alerts, maneuver guidance, or reports when adverse medical conditions are 
predicted.
METHODS: We utilized the publicly available Medical Information Mart for 
Intensive Care (MIMIC) database to extract ICU stay data for adult patients to 
build two prediction models: one for mortality prediction and another for ICU 
length of stay. For the mortality model, we applied six commonly used machine 
learning (ML) binary classification algorithms for predicting the discharge 
status (survived or not). For the length of stay model, we applied the same six 
ML algorithms for binary classification using the median patient population ICU 
stay of 2.64 days. For the regression-based classification, we used two ML 
algorithms for predicting the number of days. We built two variations of each 
prediction model: one using 12 baseline demographic and vital sign features, and 
the other based on our proposed quantiles approach, in which we use 21 extra 
features engineered from the baseline vital sign features, including their 
modified means, standard deviations, and quantile percentages.
RESULTS: We could perform predictive modeling with minimal features while 
maintaining reasonable performance using the quantiles approach. The best 
accuracy achieved in the mortality model was approximately 89% using the random 
forest algorithm. The highest accuracy achieved in the length of stay model, 
based on the population median ICU stay (2.64 days), was approximately 65% using 
the random forest algorithm.
CONCLUSIONS: The novelty in our approach is that we built models to predict ICU 
length of stay and mortality with reasonable accuracy based on a combination of 
ML and the quantiles approach that utilizes only vital signs available from the 
patient's profile without the need to use any external features. This approach 
is based on feature engineering of the vital signs by including their modified 
means, standard deviations, and quantile percentages of the original features, 
which provided a richer dataset to achieve better predictive power in our 
models.

PURPOSE: Cardiac arrest (CA) is the most serious death-related event in 
critically ill patients and the early detection of CA is beneficial to reduce 
mortality according to clinical research. This study aims to develop and verify 
a real-time, interpretable machine learning model, namely cardiac arrest 
prediction index (CAPI), to predict CA of critically ill patients based on 
bedside vital signs monitoring.
METHODS: A total of 1,860 patients were analyzed retrospectively from the 
Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care III (MIMIC-III) database. Based on 
vital signs, we extracted a total of 43 features for building machine learning 
model. Extreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost) was used to develop a real-time 
prediction model. Three-fold cross validation determined the consistency of 
model accuracy. SHAP value was used to capture the overall and real-time 
interpretability of the model.
RESULTS: On the test set, CAPI predicted 95% of CA events, 80% of which were 
identified more than 25 min in advance, resulting in an area under the receiver 
operating characteristic curve (AUROC) of 0.94. The sensitivity, specificity, 
area under the precision-recall curve (AUPRC) and F1-score were 0.86, 0.85, 0.12 
and 0.05, respectively.
CONCLUSION: CAPI can help predict patients with CA in the vital signs monitoring 
at bedside. Compared with previous studies, CAPI can give more timely 
notifications to doctors for CA events. However, current performance was at the 
cost of alarm fatigue. Future research is still needed to achieve better 
clinical application.

Introduction: The incidence of postoperative sepsis is continually increased, 
while few studies have specifically focused on the risk factors and clinical 
outcomes associated with the development of sepsis after surgical procedures. 
The present study aimed to develop a mathematical model for predicting the 
in-hospital mortality among patients with postoperative sepsis. Materials and 
Methods: Surgical patients in Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care 
(MIMIC-III) database who simultaneously fulfilled Sepsis 3.0 and Agency for 
Healthcare Research and Quality (AHRQ) criteria at ICU admission were 
incorporated. We employed both extreme gradient boosting (XGBoost) and stepwise 
logistic regression model to predict the in-hospital mortality among patients 
with postoperative sepsis. Consequently, the model performance was assessed from 
the angles of discrimination and calibration. Results: We included 3,713 
patients who fulfilled our inclusion criteria, in which 397 (10.7%) patients 
died during hospitalization, and 3,316 (89.3%) patients survived through 
discharge. Fluid-electrolyte disturbance, coagulopathy, renal replacement 
therapy (RRT), urine output, and cardiovascular surgery were important features 
related to the in-hospital mortality. The XGBoost model had a better performance 
in both discriminatory ability (c-statistics, 0.835 vs. 0.737 and 0.621, 
respectively; AUPRC, 0.418 vs. 0.280 and 0.237, respectively) and goodness of 
fit (visualized by calibration curve) compared to the stepwise logistic 
regression model and baseline model. Conclusion: XGBoost model has a better 
performance in predicting hospital mortality among patients with postoperative 
sepsis in comparison to the stepwise logistic regression model. Machine 
learning-based algorithm might have significant application in the development 
of early warning system for septic patients following major operations.

We developed an interpretable machine learning algorithm that prospectively 
predicts the risk of thrombocytopenia in older critically ill patients during 
their stay in the intensive care unit (ICU), ultimately aiding clinical 
decision-making and improving patient care. Data from 2286 geriatric patients 
who underwent surgery and were admitted to the ICU of Dongyang People's Hospital 
between 2012 and 2021 were retrospectively analyzed. Integrated algorithms were 
developed, and four machine-learning algorithms were used. Selected 
characteristics included common demographic data, biochemical indicators, and 
vital signs. Eight key variables were selected using the Least Absolute 
Shrinkage and Selection Operator and Random Forest Algorithm. Thrombocytopenia 
occurred in 18.2% of postoperative geriatric patients, with a higher mortality 
rate. The C5.0 model showed the best performance, with an area under the 
receiver operating characteristic curve close to 0.85, along with unparalleled 
accuracy, precision, specificity, recall, and balanced accuracy scores of 0.88, 
0.98, 0.89, 0.98, and 0.85, respectively. The support vector machine model 
excelled at predictively assessing thrombocytopenia severity, demonstrating an 
accuracy rate of 0.80 in the MIMIC database. Thus, our machine learning-based 
models have considerable potential in effectively predicting the risk and 
severity of postoperative thrombocytopenia in geriatric ICU patients for better 
clinical decision-making and patient care.

BACKGROUND: To construct several prediction models for the risk of stroke in 
coronary artery disease (CAD) patients receiving coronary revascularization 
based on machine learning methods.
METHODS: In total, 5757 CAD patients receiving coronary revascularization 
admitted to ICU in Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care IV (MIMIC-IV) 
were included in this cohort study. All the data were randomly split into the 
training set (n = 4029) and testing set (n = 1728) at 7:3. Pearson correlation 
analysis and least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) regression 
model were applied for feature screening. Variables with Pearson correlation 
coefficient<9 were included, and the regression coefficients were set to 0. 
Features more closely related to the outcome were selected from the 10-fold 
cross-validation, and features with non-0 Coefficent were retained and included 
in the final model. The predictive values of the models were evaluated by 
sensitivity, specificity, area under the curve (AUC), accuracy, and 95% 
confidence interval (CI).
RESULTS: The Catboost model presented the best predictive performance with the 
AUC of 0.831 (95%CI: 0.811-0.851) in the training set, and 0.760 (95%CI: 
0.722-0.798) in the testing set. The AUC of the logistic regression model was 
0.789 (95%CI: 0.764-0.814) in the training set and 0.731 (95%CI: 0.686-0.776) in 
the testing set. The results of Delong test revealed that the predictive value 
of the Catboost model was significantly higher than the logistic regression 
model (P<0.05). Charlson Comorbidity Index (CCI) was the most important variable 
associated with the risk of stroke in CAD patients receiving coronary 
revascularization.
CONCLUSION: The Catboost model was the optimal model for predicting the risk of 
stroke in CAD patients receiving coronary revascularization, which might provide 
a tool to quickly identify CAD patients who were at high risk of postoperative 
stroke.

BACKGROUND: Family history information is important to assess the risk of 
inherited medical conditions. Natural language processing has the potential to 
extract this information from unstructured free-text notes to improve patient 
care and decision making. We describe the end-to-end information extraction 
system the Medical University of South Carolina team developed when 
participating in the 2019 National Natural Language Processing Clinical 
Challenge (n2c2)/Open Health Natural Language Processing (OHNLP) shared task.
OBJECTIVE: This task involves identifying mentions of family members and 
observations in electronic health record text notes and recognizing the 2 types 
of relations (family member-living status relations and family 
member-observation relations). Our system aims to achieve a high level of 
performance by integrating heuristics and advanced information extraction 
methods. Our efforts also include improving the performance of 2 subtasks by 
exploiting additional labeled data and clinical text-based embedding models.
METHODS: We present a hybrid method that combines machine learning and 
rule-based approaches. We implemented an end-to-end system with multiple 
information extraction and attribute classification components. For entity 
identification, we trained bidirectional long short-term memory deep learning 
models. These models incorporated static word embeddings and context-dependent 
embeddings. We created a voting ensemble that combined the predictions of all 
individual models. For relation extraction, we trained 2 relation extraction 
models. The first model determined the living status of each family member. The 
second model identified observations associated with each family member. We 
implemented online gradient descent models to extract related entity pairs. As 
part of postchallenge efforts, we used the BioCreative/OHNLP 2018 corpus and 
trained new models with the union of these 2 datasets. We also pretrained 
language models using clinical notes from the Medical Information Mart for 
Intensive Care (MIMIC-III) clinical database.
RESULTS: The voting ensemble achieved better performance than individual 
classifiers. In the entity identification task, our top-performing system 
reached a precision of 78.90% and a recall of 83.84%. Our natural language 
processing system for entity identification took 3rd place out of 17 teams in 
the challenge. We ranked 4th out of 9 teams in the relation extraction task. Our 
system substantially benefited from the combination of the 2 datasets. Compared 
to our official submission with F1 scores of 81.30% and 64.94% for entity 
identification and relation extraction, respectively, the revised system yielded 
significantly better performance (P<.05) with F1 scores of 86.02% and 72.48%, 
respectively.
CONCLUSIONS: We demonstrated that a hybrid model could be used to successfully 
extract family history information recorded in unstructured free-text notes. In 
this study, our approach to entity identification as a sequence labeling problem 
produced satisfactory results. Our postchallenge efforts significantly improved 
performance by leveraging additional labeled data and using word vector 
representations learned from large collections of clinical notes.

BACKGROUND: This study aimed to explore the impact of hypoxic hepatitis (HH) on 
survival in heart failure (HF) patients and to develop an effective machine 
learning model to predict 30-day mortality risk in HF patients with HH.
METHODS: In the Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care (MIMIC)-III and IV 
databases, clinical data and survival situations of HF patients admitted to the 
intensive care unit (ICU) were retrospectively collected. Propensity Score 
Matching (PSM) analysis was used to balance baseline differences between HF 
patients with and without HH. Kaplan Meier analysis and multivariate Cox 
analysis were used to determining the effect of HH on the survival of CF 
patients. For developing a model that can predict 30-day mortality in CF 
patients with HH, the feature recurrence elimination (RFE) method was applied to 
feature selection, and seven machine learning algorithms were employed to model 
construction. After training and hyper-parameter optimization (HPO) of the model 
through cross-validation in the training set, a performance comparison was 
performed through internal and external validation. To interpret the optimal 
model, Shapley Additive Explanations (SHAP) were used along with the Local 
Interpretable Model-agnostic Explanations (LIME) and the Partial Dependence Plot 
(PDP) techniques.
RESULTS: The incidence of HH was 6.5% in HF patients in the MIMIC cohort. HF 
patients with HH had a 30-day mortality rate of 33% and a 1-year mortality rate 
of 51%, and HH was an independent risk factor for increased short-term and 
long-term mortality risk in HF patients. After RFE, 21 key features (21/56) were 
selected to build the model. Internal validation and external validation 
suggested that Categorical Boosting (Catboost) had a higher discriminatory 
capability than the other models (internal validation: AUC, 0.832; 95% CI, 
0.819-0.845; external validation: AUC, 0.757 95% CI, 0.739-0.776), and the 
simplified Catboost model (S-Catboost) also had good performance in both 
internal validation and external validation (internal validation: AUC, 0.801; 
95% CI, 0.787-0.813; external validation: AUC, 0.729, 95% CI, 0.711-0.745).
CONCLUSION: HH was associated with increased mortality in HF patients. Machine 
learning methods had good performance in identifying the 30-day mortality risk 
of HF with HH. With interpretability techniques, the transparency of machine 
learning models has been enhanced to facilitate user understanding of the 
prediction results.

The purpose of this retrospective study was to assess whether mortality 
following a hip fracture can be predicted by a machine learning model trained on 
basic blood and lab test data as well as basic demographic data. Additionally, 
the purpose was to identify the key variables most associated with 1-, 5-, and 
10-year mortality and investigate their clinical significance. Input data 
included 3751 hip fracture patient records sourced from the Medical Information 
Mart for Intensive Care IV database, which provided records from in-hospital 
database systems at the Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center. The 1-year 
mortality rate for all patients studied was 21% and for those aged 80+ was 29%. 
We assessed 10 different machine learning classification models, finding 
LightGBM to have the strongest 1-year mortality prediction performance, with 
accuracy of 81%, AUC of 0.79, sensitivity of 0.34, and specificity of 0.98 on 
the test set. The strongest-weighted features of the 1-year model included age, 
glucose, red blood cell distribution width, mean corpuscular hemoglobin 
concentration, white blood cells, urea nitrogen, prothrombin time, platelet 
count, calcium levels, and partial thromboplastin time. Most of these were also 
in the top 10 features of the LightGBM 5- and 10-year prediction models trained. 
Testing for these high-ranking biomarkers in new hip fracture patients can aid 
clinicians in assessing the likelihood of poor outcomes for hip fracture 
patients, and additional research can use these biomarkers to develop a 
mortality risk score.

BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: Delirium is the most common neuropsychological 
complication among older adults admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) and is 
often associated with a poor prognosis. This study aimed to construct and 
validate an interpretable machine learning (ML) for early delirium prediction in 
older ICU patients.
METHODS: This was a retrospective observational cohort study and patient data 
were extracted from the Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care-IV database. 
Feature variables associated with delirium, including predisposing factors, 
disease-related factors, and iatrogenic and environmental factors, were selected 
using least absolute shrinkage and selection operator regression, and prediction 
models were built using logistic regression, decision trees, support vector 
machines, extreme gradient boosting (XGBoost), k-nearest neighbors and naive 
Bayes methods. Multiple metrics were used for evaluation of performance of the 
models, including the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve 
(AUC), accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, recall, F1 score, calibration plot, 
and decision curve analysis. SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) were used to 
improve the interpretability of the final model.
RESULTS: Nine thousand seven hundred forty-eight adults aged 65 years or older 
were included for analysis. Twenty-six features were selected to construct ML 
prediction models. Among the models compared, the XGBoost model demonstrated the 
best performance including the highest AUC (0.836), accuracy (0.765), 
sensitivity (0.713), recall (0.713), and F1 score (0.725) in the training set. 
It also exhibited excellent discrimination with AUC of 0.810, good calibration, 
and had the highest net benefit in the validation cohort. The SHAP summary 
analysis showed that Glasgow Coma Scale, mechanical ventilation, and sedation 
were the top three risk features for outcome prediction. The SHAP dependency 
plot and SHAP force analysis interpreted the model at both the factor level and 
individual level, respectively.
CONCLUSION: ML is a reliable tool for predicting the risk of critical delirium 
in elderly patients. By combining XGBoost and SHAP, it can provide clear 
explanations for personalized risk prediction and more intuitive understanding 
of the effect of key features in the model. The establishment of such a model 
would facilitate the early risk assessment and prompt intervention for delirium.

INTRODUCTION: Delirium occurrence is common and preventive strategies are 
resource intensive. Screening tools can prioritize patients at risk. Using 
machine learning, we can capture time and treatment effects that pose a 
challenge to delirium prediction. We aim to develop a delirium prediction model 
that can be used as a screening tool.
METHODS: From the eICU Collaborative Research Database (eICU-CRD) and the 
Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care version III (MIMIC-III) database, 
patients with one or more Confusion Assessment Method-Intensive Care Unit 
(CAM-ICU) values and intensive care unit (ICU) length of stay greater than 24 h 
were included in our study. We validated our model using 21 quantitative 
clinical parameters and assessed performance across a range of observation and 
prediction windows, using different thresholds and applied interpretation 
techniques. We evaluate our models based on stratified repeated cross-validation 
using 3 algorithms, namely Logistic Regression, Random Forest, and Bidirectional 
Long Short-Term Memory (BiLSTM). BiLSTM represents an evolution from recurrent 
neural network-based Long Short-Term Memory, and with a backward input, 
preserves information from both past and future. Model performance is measured 
using Area Under Receiver Operating Characteristic, Area Under Precision Recall 
Curve, Recall, Precision (Positive Predictive Value), and Negative Predictive 
Value metrics.
RESULTS: We evaluated our results on 16 546 patients (47% female) and 6294 
patients (44% female) from eICU-CRD and MIMIC-III databases, respectively. 
Performance was best in BiLSTM models where, precision and recall changed from 
37.52% (95% confidence interval [CI], 36.00%-39.05%) to 17.45 (95% CI, 
15.83%-19.08%) and 86.1% (95% CI, 82.49%-89.71%) to 75.58% (95% CI, 
68.33%-82.83%), respectively as prediction window increased from 12 to 96 h. 
After optimizing for higher recall, precision and recall changed from 26.96% 
(95% CI, 24.99%-28.94%) to 11.34% (95% CI, 10.71%-11.98%) and 93.73% (95% CI, 
93.1%-94.37%) to 92.57% (95% CI, 88.19%-96.95%), respectively. Comparable 
results were obtained in the MIMIC-III cohort.
CONCLUSIONS: Our model performed comparably to contemporary models using fewer 
variables. Using techniques like sliding windows, modification of threshold to 
augment recall and feature ranking for interpretability, we addressed 
shortcomings of current models.

BACKGROUND: Heart failure (HF) is a life-threatening complication of 
cardiovascular disease. HF patients are more likely to progress to acute kidney 
injury (AKI) with a poor prognosis. However, it is difficult for doctors to 
distinguish which patients will develop AKI accurately. This study aimed to 
construct a machine learning (ML) model to predict AKI occurrence in HF 
patients.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: The data of HF patients from the Medical Information Mart 
for Intensive Care-IV (MIMIC-IV) database was retrospectively analyzed. A ML 
model was established to predict AKI development using decision tree, random 
forest (RF), support vector machine (SVM), K-nearest neighbor (KNN), and 
logistic regression (LR) algorithms. Thirty-nine demographic, clinical, and 
treatment features were used for model establishment. Accuracy, sensitivity, 
specificity, and the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve 
(AUROC) were used to evaluate the performance of the ML algorithms.
RESULTS: A total of 2,678 HF patients were engaged in this study, of whom 919 
developed AKI. Among 5 ML algorithms, the RF algorithm exhibited the highest 
performance with the AUROC of 0.96. In addition, the Gini index showed that the 
sequential organ function assessment (SOFA) score, partial pressure of oxygen 
(PaO2), and estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) were highly relevant to 
AKI development. Finally, to facilitate clinical application, a simple model was 
constructed using the 10 features screened by the Gini index. The RF algorithm 
also exhibited the highest performance with the AUROC of 0.95.
CONCLUSION: Using the ML model could accurately predict the development of AKI 
in HF patients.

OBJECTIVE: Chronic kidney disease (CKD) patients with coronary artery disease 
(CAD) in the intensive care unit (ICU) have higher in-hospital mortality and 
poorer prognosis than patients with either single condition. The objective of 
this study is to develop a novel model that can predict the in-hospital 
mortality of that kind of patient in the ICU using machine learning methods.
METHODS: Data of CKD patients with CAD were extracted from the Medical 
Information Mart for Intensive Care IV (MIMIC-IV) database. Boruta algorithm was 
conducted for the feature selection process. Eight machine learning algorithms, 
such as logistic regression (LR), random forest (RF), Decision Tree, K-nearest 
neighbors (KNN), Gradient Boosting Decision Tree Machine (GBDT), Support Vector 
Machine (SVM), Neural Network (NN), and Extreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost), 
were conducted to construct the predictive model for in-hospital mortality and 
performance was evaluated by average precision (AP) and area under the receiver 
operating characteristic curve (AUC). Shapley Additive Explanations (SHAP) 
algorithm was applied to explain the model visually. Moreover, data from the 
Telehealth Intensive Care Unit Collaborative Research Database (eICU-CRD) were 
acquired as an external validation set.
RESULTS: 3590 and 1657 CKD patients with CAD were acquired from MIMIC-IV and 
eICU-CRD databases, respectively. A total of 78 variables were selected for the 
machine learning model development process. Comparatively, GBDT had the highest 
predictive performance according to the results of AUC (0.946) and AP (0.778). 
The SHAP method reveals the top 20 factors based on the importance ranking. In 
addition, GBDT had good predictive value and a certain degree of clinical value 
in the external validation according to the AUC (0.865), AP (0.672), decision 
curve analysis, and calibration curve.
CONCLUSION: Machine learning algorithms, especially GBDT, can be reliable tools 
for accurately predicting the in-hospital mortality risk for CKD patients with 
CAD in the ICU. This contributed to providing optimal resource allocation and 
reducing in-hospital mortality by tailoring precise management and 
implementation of early interventions.

OBJECTIVES: To evaluate whether early intensive care transthoracic 
echocardiography (TTE) can improve the prognosis of patients with mechanical 
ventilation (MV).
DESIGN: A retrospective cohort study.
SETTING: Patients undergoing MV for more than 48 hours, based on the Medical 
Information Mart for Intensive Care III (MIMIC-III) database and the eICU 
Collaborative Research Database (eICU-CRD), were selected.
PARTICIPANTS: 2931 and 6236 patients were recruited from the MIMIC-III database 
and the eICU database, respectively.
PRIMARY AND SECONDARY OUTCOME MEASURES: The primary outcome was in-hospital 
mortality. Secondary outcomes were 30-day mortality from the date of ICU 
admission, days free of MV and vasopressors 30 days after ICU admission, use of 
vasoactive drugs, total intravenous fluid and ventilator settings during the 
first day of MV.
RESULTS: We used propensity score matching to analyse the association between 
early TTE and in-hospital mortality and sensitivity analysis, including the 
inverse probability weighting model and covariate balancing propensity score 
model, to ensure the robustness of our findings. The adjusted OR showed a 
favourable effect between the early TTE group and in-hospital mortality (MIMIC: 
OR 0.78; 95% CI 0.65 to 0.94, p=0.01; eICU-CRD: OR 0.76; 95% CI 0.67 to 0.86, 
p<0.01). Early TTE was also associated with 30-day mortality in the MIMIC 
database (OR 0.71, 95% CI 0.57 to 0.88, p=0.001). Furthermore, those who had 
early TTE had both more ventilation-free days (only in eICU-CRD: 23.48 vs 24.57, 
p<0.01) and more vasopressor-free days (MIMIC: 18.22 vs 20.64, p=0.005; 
eICU-CRD: 27.37 vs 28.59, p<0.001) than the control group (TTE applied outside 
of the early TTE and no TTE at all).
CONCLUSIONS: Early application of critical care TTE during MV is beneficial for 
improving in-hospital mortality. Further investigation with prospectively 
collected data is required to validate this relationship.

OBJECTIVE: Prediction of disease phenotypes and their outcomes is a difficult 
task. In practice, patients routinely seek second opinions from multiple 
clinical experts for complex disease diagnosis. Our objective is to mimic such a 
practice of seeking second opinions by training 2 agents with different focuses: 
the primary agent studies the most recent visit of the patient to learn the 
current health status, and then the second-opinion agent considers the entire 
patient history to obtain a more global view.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: Our approach Dr. Agent augments recurrent neural networks 
with 2 policy gradient agents. Moreover, Dr. Agent is customized with various 
patient demographics information and learns a dynamic skip connection to focus 
on the relevant information over time. We trained Dr. Agent to perform 4 
clinical prediction tasks on the publicly available MIMIC-III (Medical 
Information Mart for Intensive Care) database: (1) in-hospital mortality 
prediction, (2) acute care phenotype classification, (3) physiologic 
decompensation prediction, and (4) forecasting length of stay. We compared the 
performance of Dr. Agent against 4 baseline clinical predictive models.
RESULTS: Dr. Agent outperforms baseline clinical prediction models across all 4 
tasks in terms of all metrics. Compared with the best baseline model, Dr. Agent 
achieves up to 15% higher area under the precision-recall curve on different 
tasks.
CONCLUSIONS: Dr. Agent can comprehensively model the long-term dependencies of 
patients' health status while considering patients' demographics using 2 agents, 
and therefore achieves better prediction performance on different clinical 
prediction tasks.

BACKGROUND: Upper gastrointestinal bleeding (UGIB) is a significant cause of 
morbidity and mortality worldwide. This study investigates the use of residual 
variables and machine learning (ML) models for predicting major bleeding in 
patients with severe UGIB after their first intensive care unit (ICU) admission.
METHODS: The Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care IV and eICU databases 
were used. Conventional ML and long short-term memory models were constructed 
using pre-ICU and ICU admission day data to predict the recurrence of major 
gastrointestinal bleeding. In the models, residual data were utilized by 
subtracting the normal range from the test result. The models included eight 
algorithms. Shapley additive explanations and saliency maps were used for 
feature interpretability.
RESULTS: Twenty-five ML models were developed using data from 2604 patients. The 
light gradient-boosting machine algorithm model using pre-ICU admission residual 
data outperformed other models that used test results directly, with an AUC of 
0.96. The key factors included aspartate aminotransferase, blood urea nitrogen, 
albumin, length of ICU admission, and respiratory rate.
CONCLUSIONS: ML models using residuals improved the accuracy and 
interpretability in predicting major bleeding during ICU admission in patients 
with UGIB. These interpretable features may facilitate the early identification 
and management of high-risk patients, thereby improving hemodynamic stability 
and outcomes.

BACKGROUND: Prognostication is an essential tool for risk adjustment and 
decision making in the intensive care units (ICUs). In order to improve patient 
outcomes, we have been trying to develop a more effective model than Acute 
Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation (APACHE) II to measure the severity of 
the patients in ICUs. The aim of the present study was to provide a mortality 
prediction model for ICUs patients, and to assess its performance relative to 
prediction based on the APACHE II scoring system.
METHODS: We used the Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care version III 
(MIMIC-III) database to build our model. After comparing the APACHE II with 6 
typical machine learning (ML) methods, the best performing model was screened 
for external validation on anther independent dataset. Performance measures were 
calculated using cross-validation to avoid making biased assessments. The 
primary outcome was hospital mortality. Finally, we used TreeSHAP algorithm to 
explain the variable relationships in the extreme gradient boosting algorithm 
(XGBoost) model.
RESULTS: We picked out 14 variables with 24,777 cases to form our basic data 
set. When the variables were the same as those contained in the APACHE II, the 
accuracy of XGBoost (accuracy: 0.858) was higher than that of APACHE II 
(accuracy: 0.742) and other algorithms. In addition, it exhibited better 
calibration properties than other methods, the result in the area under the ROC 
curve (AUC: 0.76). we then expand the variable set by adding five new variables 
to improve the performance of our model. The accuracy, precision, recall, F1, 
and AUC of the XGBoost model increased, and were still higher than other models 
(0.866, 0.853, 0.870, 0.845, and 0.81, respectively). On the external validation 
dataset, the AUC was 0.79 and calibration properties were good.
CONCLUSIONS: As compared to conventional severity scores APACHE II, our XGBoost 
proposal offers improved performance for predicting hospital mortality in ICUs 
patients. Furthermore, the TreeSHAP can help to enhance the understanding of our 
model by providing detailed insights into the impact of different features on 
the disease risk. In sum, our model could help clinicians determine prognosis 
and improve patient outcomes.

PURPOSE: To develop and validate a machine learning (ML)-based prediction model 
for acute kidney injury (AKI) in patients with liver cirrhosis.
METHODS: Data on liver cirrhosis patients were extracted from the Medical 
Information Mart for Intensive Care III (MIMIC-III) and MIMIC-IV databases in 
this retrospective cohort study. ML algorithms, including random forest (RF), 
extreme gradient boosting (XGB), light gradient boosting machine (LGBM), and 
gradient boosting decision tree (GBDT) were applied to construct prediction 
models. Predictors were screened via univariate logistic regression, and then 
the models were developed with all data of the included patients. A bootstrap 
resampling method was adopted to validate the models. The predictive abilities 
of our final model were compared with those of the sequential organ failure 
assessment score (SOFA), simplified acute physiology score II (SAPS II), Model 
for End-stage Liver Disease (MELD), and MELD Na.
RESULTS: This study included 950 patients, of which 429 (45.16%) had AKI. 
Mechanical ventilation, vasopressor, international normalized ratio (INR), 
bilirubin, Charlson comorbidity index (CCI), prothrombin time (PT), estimated 
glomerular filtration rate (EGFR), partial thromboplastin time (PTT), and heart 
rate served as predictors. In the derivation set, the developed RF [area under 
curve (AUC) = 0.747], XGB (AUC = 0.832), LGBM (AUC = 0.785), and GBDT 
(AUC = 0.811) models exhibited significantly greater predictive performance than 
the logistic regression model (AUC = 0.699) (all P < 0.05). Among the ML-based 
models, the XGB model had the greatest AUC. In internal validation, the 
predictive capacity of the XGB model (AUC = 0.833) was significantly superior to 
that of the logistic regression model (AUC = 0.701) (P = 0.045). Hence, the XGB 
model was selected as the final model for AKI prediction. In contrast to the XGB 
model (AUC = 0.832), the SOFA (AUC = 0.609), MELD (AUC = 0.690), MELD Na 
(AUC = 0.690), and SAPS II (AUC = 0.641) had significantly lower predictive 
abilities in the derivation set (all P < 0.001). The XGB model was internally 
validated to have an AUC of 0.833, which was significantly higher than the SOFA 
(AUC = 0.609), MELD (AUC = 0.690), MELD Na (AUC = 0.688), and SAPS II 
(AUC = 0.641) (all P < 0.05).
CONCLUSION: The XGB model had a better performance than the logistic regression 
model, SOFA, MELD, MELD Na, and SAPS II in AKI prediction for cirrhosis 
patients, which may help identify patients at a risk of AKI, and then provide 
timely interventions.

Increased monitoring of health-related data for ICU patients holds great 
potential for the early prediction of medical outcomes. Research on whether the 
use of clinical notes and concepts from knowledge bases can improve the 
performance of prediction models is limited. We investigated the effects of 
combining clinical variables, clinical notes, and clinical concepts. We focus on 
the early prediction of Acute Kidney Injury (AKI) in the intensive care unit 
(ICU). AKI is a sudden reduction in kidney function measured by increased serum 
creatinine (SCr) or decreased urine output. AKI may occur in up to 30% of ICU 
stays. We developed three models based on convolutional neural networks using 
data from the Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care (MIMIC) database. The 
models used clinical variables, free-text notes, and concepts from the Elsevier 
H-Graph. Our models achieved good predictive performance (AUROC 0.73-0.90). 
These models were assessed both when using Scr and urine output as predictors 
and when omitting them. When Scr and urine output were used as predictors, 
models that included clinical notes and concepts together with clinical 
variables performed on par with models that only used clinical variables. When 
excluding SCr and urine output, predictive performance improved by combining 
multiple modalities. The models that used only clinical variables were 
externally validated on the eICU dataset and transported fairly to the new 
population (AUROC 0.68-0.77). Our in-depth comparison of modalities and text 
representations may further guide researchers and practitioners in applying 
multimodal models for predicting AKI and inspire them to investigate 
multimodality and contextualized embeddings for other tasks. Our models can 
support clinicians to promptly recognize and treat deteriorating AKI patients 
and may improve patient outcomes in the ICU.

BACKGROUND: Early and accurate identification of sepsis patients with high risk 
of in-hospital death can help physicians in intensive care units (ICUs) make 
optimal clinical decisions. This study aimed to develop machine learning-based 
tools to predict the risk of hospital death of patients with sepsis in ICUs.
METHODS: The source database used for model development and validation is the 
medical information mart for intensive care (MIMIC) III. We identified adult 
sepsis patients using the new sepsis definition Sepsis-3. A total of 86 
predictor variables consisting of demographics, laboratory tests and 
comorbidities were used. We employed the least absolute shrinkage and selection 
operator (LASSO), random forest (RF), gradient boosting machine (GBM) and the 
traditional logistic regression (LR) method to develop prediction models. In 
addition, the prediction performance of the four developed models was evaluated 
and compared with that of an existent scoring tool - simplified acute physiology 
score (SAPS) II - using five different performance measures: the area under the 
receiver operating characteristic curve (AUROC), Brier score, sensitivity, 
specificity and calibration plot.
RESULTS: The records of 16,688 sepsis patients in MIMIC III were used for model 
training and test. Amongst them, 2949 (17.7%) patients had in-hospital death. 
The average AUROCs of the LASSO, RF, GBM, LR and SAPS II models were 0.829, 
0.829, 0.845, 0.833 and 0.77, respectively. The Brier scores of the LASSO, RF, 
GBM, LR and SAPS II models were 0.108, 0.109, 0.104, 0.107 and 0.146, 
respectively. The calibration plots showed that the GBM, LASSO and LR models had 
good calibration; the RF model underestimated high-risk patients; and SAPS II 
had the poorest calibration.
CONCLUSION: The machine learning-based models developed in this study had good 
prediction performance. Amongst them, the GBM model showed the best performance 
in predicting the risk of in-hospital death. It has the potential to assist 
physicians in the ICU to perform appropriate clinical interventions for 
critically ill sepsis patients and thus may help improve the prognoses of sepsis 
patients in the ICU.

BACKGROUND: Open wounds have a significant impact on the health of patients 
causing pain, loss of function, and death. Labeled as a comorbid condition, open 
wounds represent a "silent epidemic" that affect a large portion of the US 
population. Due to their burden of care, open wound patients face an increased 
risk of ICU stay and mortality. There is a dearth of studies that investigate 
mortality among wound patients in the ICU. We sought to develop a model that 
predicts the risk of mortality among wound patients in the ICU.
METHODS: Random forest and binomial logistic regression models were developed to 
predict the risk of mortality among open wound patients in the Medical 
Information Mart for Intensive Care III (MIMIC-III) database. MIMIC-III includes 
de-identified data for patients who stayed in critical care units of the Beth 
Israel Deaconess Medical Center between 2001 and 2012. Six variables were used 
to develop the model (wound location, gender, age, admission type, minimum 
platelet count and hyperphosphatemia). The Charlson Comorbidity Index (CCI) and 
Elixhauser Comorbidity Index were used to assess model strength.
RESULTS: A total of 3,937 patients were included with a mean age of 76.57. Of 
those, 3,372 (85%) survived and 565 (15%) died during their ICU stay. The random 
forest model achieved an area under the curve (AUC) of 0.924. The CCI and 
Elixhauser models resulted in AUC of 0.528 and 0.565, respectively.
CONCLUSIONS: Machine learning models may allow clinicians to provide better care 
and management to open wound patients in the ICU.

PURPOSE: This study aimed to use traditional statistics and machine learning to 
develop and validate prediction models for predicting hospital death in patients 
with AMI and compare these models' performance.
PATIENTS AND METHODS: Data were retrieved from the Medical Information Mart for 
Intensive Care (MIMIC III) electronic clinical database. A total of 338 eligible 
AMI patients were divided into a training cohort (n = 238) and a validation 
cohort (n = 100), and all patients were divided into survival groups and 
nonsurvival groups according to patients' hospital outcomes. The performance of 
the traditional statistics prediction model and the optimal machine learning 
prediction model was evaluated and compared with respect to discrimination, 
calibration, and clinical utility in the validation cohort.
RESULTS: Univariate and multivariate logistic regression analyses identified the 
following independent risk factors associated with hospital death for AMI in the 
training cohort, including diastolic blood pressure, blood lactate, blood 
creatinine, age, blood pH, and red blood cell distribution width. Both the 
nomogram (AUC = 77.0%, 67.9-86.1%) and optimal machine learning model (AUC = 
82.9%, 74.9-91.0%) achieved good discrimination and calibration in the 
validation cohort. Decision curves analysis showed that the optimal machine 
learning model has a greater net benefit than that of nomogram in this study.
CONCLUSION: The nomogram achieved a concise and relatively accurate prediction 
of hospital death in patients with AMI, the machine learning model also has good 
discrimination and seems to have better clinical utility. Traditional statistics 
may help infer the relationship between risk factors and hospital death, while 
machine learning may contribute to a more accurate prediction. Traditional 
statistics and machine learning are complementary in developing the prediction 
model for hospital death of AMI. Therefore, a combination of nomogram-machine 
learning (Nomo-ML) predictive model may improve care and help clinicians make 
AMI management-related decisions.

Measuring continuous blood pressure (BP) in real time by using a mobile health 
(mHealth) application would open a new door in the advancement of the healthcare 
system. This study aimed to propose a real-time method and system for measuring 
BP without using a cuff from a digital artery. An energy-efficient real-time 
smartphone-application-friendly one-dimensional (1D) Squeeze U-net model is 
proposed to estimate systolic and diastolic BP values, using only raw 
photoplethysmogram (PPG) signal. The proposed real-time cuffless BP prediction 
method was assessed for accuracy, reliability, and potential usefulness in the 
hypertensive assessment of 100 individuals in two publicly available datasets: 
Multiparameter Intelligent Monitoring in Intensive Care (MIMIC-I) and Medical 
Information Mart for Intensive Care (MIMIC-III) waveform database. The proposed 
model was used to build an android application to measure BP at home. This 
proposed deep-learning model performs best in terms of systolic BP, diastolic 
BP, and mean arterial pressure, with a mean absolute error of 4.42, 2.25, and 
2.56 mmHg and standard deviation of 4.78, 2.98, and 3.21 mmHg, respectively. The 
results meet the grade A performance requirements of the British Hypertension 
Society and satisfy the AAMI error range. The result suggests that only using a 
short-time PPG signal is sufficient to obtain accurate BP measurements in real 
time. It is a novel approach for real-time cuffless BP estimation by 
implementing an mHealth application and can measure BP at home and assess 
hypertension.

BACKGROUND: For critically ill patients with acute kidney injury (AKI), there 
remains controversy regarding the predictive factors affecting the 
discontinuation of continuous renal replacement therapy (CRRT). This study aims 
to explore factors associated with successful CRRT discontinuation in AKI 
patients and to develop predictive models for successful discontinuation.
METHODS: We conducted a retrospective study on adult patients with AKI who 
received CRRT, sourced from the Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care 
(MIMIC-IV) database. Successful discontinuation of CRRT was defined as no CRRT 
requirement within 72 h after stopping CRRT. Predictive factors for successful 
discontinuation of CRRT were analyzed. Additionally, we utilized machine 
learning algorithms to develop predictive models, including logistic regression 
(LR), decision tree (DT), random forest (RF), XGBoost, and K-nearest neighbor 
(KNN).
RESULTS: A total of 599 patients were included, of whom 475 (79.3%) successfully 
discontinued CRRT. Urine output, non-renal SOFA score, bicarbonate, systolic 
blood pressure, and blood urea nitrogen were identified as risk factors for 
successful CRRT discontinuation. The KNN model exhibited the highest area under 
the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) (0.870), followed by LR 
(0.739), DT (0.691), RF (0.847), and XGBoost (0.830). When incorporating all 
available variables, the AUCs for the LR, DT, RF, XGBoost, and KNN models were 
0.708, 0.674, 0.875, 0.866, and 0.816, respectively. Considering the performance 
of the models in both scenarios, the ensemble learning models (RF and XGBoost) 
were demonstrated superior performance.
CONCLUSIONS: Our results identified factors associated with successful 
discontinuation of CRRT in AKI patients. Additionally, we developed promising 
machine learning models which provided a reference for future research.

INTRODUCTION: The present study presents the development and validation of a 
clinical prediction model using random survival forest (RSF) and stepwise Cox 
regression, aiming to predict the probability of pelvic inflammatory disease 
(PID) progressing to sepsis.
METHODS: A retrospective cohort study was conducted, gathering clinical data of 
patients diagnosed with PID between 2008 and 2019 from the Medical Information 
Mart for Intensive Care (MIMIC)-IV database. Patients who met the Sepsis 3.0 
diagnostic criteria were selected, with sepsis as the outcome. Univariate Cox 
regression and stepwise Cox regression were used to screen variables for 
constructing a nomogram. Moreover, an RSF model was created using machine 
learning algorithms. To verify the model's performance, a calibration curve, 
decision curve analysis (DCA), and receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve 
were utilized. Furthermore, the capabilities of the two models for estimating 
the incidence of sepsis in PID patients within 3 and 7 days were compared.
RESULTS: A total of 1064 PID patients were included, of whom 54 had progressed 
to sepsis. The established nomogram highlighted dialysis, reduced platelet (PLT) 
counts, history of pneumonia, medication of glucocorticoids, and increased 
leukocyte counts as significant predictive factors. The areas under the curve 
(AUCs) of the nomogram for prediction of PID progression to sepsis at 3-day and 
7-day (3-/7-day) in the training set and the validation set were 0.886/0.863 and 
0.824/0.726, respectively, and the C-index of the model was 0.8905. The RSF 
displayed excellent performance, with AUCs of 0.939/0.919 and 0.712/0.571 for 
3-/7-day risk prediction in the training set and validation set, respectively.
CONCLUSION: The nomogram accurately predicted the incidence of sepsis in PID 
patients, and relevant risk factors were identified. While the RSF model 
outperformed the Cox regression models in predicting sepsis incidence, its 
performance exhibited some instability. On the other hand, the Cox 
regression-based nomogram displayed stable performance and improved 
interpretability, thereby supporting clinical decision-making in PID treatment.

Improving Prediction of Survival for Extremely Premature Infants Born at 23 to 
29 Weeks Gestational Age in the Neonatal Intensive Care Unit: Development and 
Evaluation of Machine Learning Models.

BACKGROUND: Infants born at extremely preterm gestational ages are typically 
admitted to the neonatal intensive care unit (NICU) after initial resuscitation. 
The subsequent hospital course can be highly variable, and despite counseling 
aided by available risk calculators, there are significant challenges with 
shared decision-making regarding life support and transition to end-of-life 
care. Improving predictive models can help providers and families navigate these 
unique challenges.
OBJECTIVE: Machine learning methods have previously demonstrated added 
predictive value for determining intensive care unit outcomes, and their use 
allows consideration of a greater number of factors that potentially influence 
newborn outcomes, such as maternal characteristics. Machine learning-based 
models were analyzed for their ability to predict the survival of extremely 
preterm neonates at initial admission.
METHODS: Maternal and newborn information was extracted from the health records 
of infants born between 23 and 29 weeks of gestation in the Medical Information 
Mart for Intensive Care III (MIMIC-III) critical care database. Applicable 
machine learning models predicting survival during the initial NICU admission 
were developed and compared. The same type of model was also examined using only 
features that would be available prepartum for the purpose of survival 
prediction prior to an anticipated preterm birth. Features most correlated with 
the predicted outcome were determined when possible for each model.
RESULTS: Of included patients, 37 of 459 (8.1%) expired. The resulting random 
forest model showed higher predictive performance than the frequently used Score 
for Neonatal Acute Physiology With Perinatal Extension II (SNAPPE-II) NICU model 
when considering extremely preterm infants of very low birth weight. Several 
other machine learning models were found to have good performance but did not 
show a statistically significant difference from previously available models in 
this study. Feature importance varied by model, and those of greater importance 
included gestational age; birth weight; initial oxygenation level; elements of 
the APGAR (appearance, pulse, grimace, activity, and respiration) score; and 
amount of blood pressure support. Important prepartum features also included 
maternal age, steroid administration, and the presence of pregnancy 
complications.
CONCLUSIONS: Machine learning methods have the potential to provide robust 
prediction of survival in the context of extremely preterm births and allow for 
consideration of additional factors such as maternal clinical and socioeconomic 
information. Evaluation of larger, more diverse data sets may provide additional 
clarity on comparative performance.

Background: Mechanically ventilated patients are susceptible to nosocomial 
infections such as ventilator-associated pneumonia. To treat ventilated patients 
with suspected infection, clinicians select appropriate antibiotics. However, 
decision-making regarding the use of antibiotics for methicillin-resistant 
Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) is challenging, because of the lack of 
evidence-supported criteria. This study aims to derive a machine learning model 
to predict MRSA as a possible pathogen responsible for infection in mechanically 
ventilated patients. Methods: Data were collected from the Medical Information 
Mart for Intensive Care (MIMIC)-IV database (an openly available database of 
patients treated at the Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center in the period 
2008-2019). Of 26,409 mechanically ventilated patients, 809 were screened for 
MRSA during the mechanical ventilation period and included in the study. The 
outcome was positivity to MRSA on screening, which was highly imbalanced in the 
dataset, with 93.9% positive outcomes. Therefore, after dividing the dataset 
into a training set (n = 566) and a test set (n = 243) for validation by 
stratified random sampling with a 7:3 allocation ratio, synthetic datasets with 
50% positive outcomes were created by synthetic minority over-sampling for both 
sets individually (synthetic training set: n = 1,064; synthetic test set: n = 
456). Using these synthetic datasets, we trained and validated an XGBoost 
machine learning model using 28 predictor variables for outcome prediction. 
Model performance was evaluated by area under the receiver operating 
characteristic (AUROC), sensitivity, specificity, and other statistical 
measurements. Feature importance was computed by the Gini method. Results: In 
validation, the XGBoost model demonstrated reliable outcome prediction with an 
AUROC value of 0.89 [95% confidence interval (CI): 0.83-0.95]. The model showed 
a high sensitivity of 0.98 [CI: 0.95-0.99], but a low specificity of 0.47 [CI: 
0.41-0.54] and a positive predictive value of 0.65 [CI: 0.62-0.68]. Important 
predictor variables included admission from the emergency department, insertion 
of arterial lines, prior quinolone use, hemodialysis, and admission to a 
surgical intensive care unit. Conclusions: We were able to develop an effective 
machine learning model to predict positive MRSA screening during mechanical 
ventilation using synthetic datasets, thus encouraging further research to 
develop a clinically relevant machine learning model for antibiotics 
stewardship.

BACKGROUND: Mild traumatic brain injury (mTBI) comprises a majority of traumatic 
brain injury (TBI) cases. While some mTBI would suffer neurological 
deterioration (ND) and therefore have poorer prognosis. This study was designed 
to develop the predictive model for the ND among mTBI using machine learning 
algorithms.
METHODS: mTBI patients recorded in the Medical Information Mart for Intensive 
Care-III were selected for the study. The ND was defined as a drop of Glasgow 
Coma Scale ≥ 2 within the first 7 day after admission. Eight machine learning 
algorithms were trained and validated with 5-fold cross validation including 
extreme gradient boosting, logistic regression, light gradient boosting machine, 
random forest, adaptive boosting, decision tree, complement naïve Bayes, and 
support vector machine. The value of eight machine learning algorithms was 
compared by the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC).
RESULTS: 361 mTBI patients suffered the ND with the incidence of 30.7%. The ND 
group had higher 30-day mortality (p = 0.001). In the training cohort of mTBI 
patients, the random forest performed the best on predicting the ND with the AUC 
of 1.000. The XGBoost and AdaBoost had an AUC of 0.827 and 0.815, respectively. 
The logistic regression performed the best on predicting the ND in the 
validation cohort with the AUC of 0.741. The XGBoost, random forest and AdaBoost 
had an AUC of 0.729, 0.735, 0.736 in the validation cohort, respectively. After 
adjusting confounding effects, the multivariate logistic regression found only 
two independent risk factors for the ND including Sequential Organ Failure 
Assessment (SOFA) (p < 0.001) and hypertension (p = 0.001). The logistic 
regression predictive model composed of SOFA and hypertension had an AUC of 
0.741.
CONCLUSIONS: SOFA score and complicated hypertension are two independent risk 
factors for the neurological deterioration among mTBI patients. The logistic 
regression predictive model incorporating SOFA and hypertension is helpful to 
identify mTBI patients with the high risk of ND.

OBJECTIVE: Early fluid resuscitation is crucial in the treatment of sepsis, yet 
the optimal dosage remains debated. This study aims to determine the optimal 
multi-stage fluid resuscitation dosage for sepsis patients.
METHODS: We propose a reinforcement learning algorithm with neural networks 
(RL-NN), utilizing the flexibility of deep learning architectures to mitigate 
model misspecification. We use cross-validation and random search for 
hyperparameter tuning to further enhance model robustness and generalization.
RESULTS: Simulation results demonstrate that our method outperforms existing 
methods in terms of both the percentage of correctly classified optimal 
treatments and the predicted counterfactual mean outcome. Applying this method 
to the sepsis cohort from the Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care III 
(MIMIC-III), we recommend that all sepsis patients receive adequate fluid 
resuscitation (≥ 30 mL/kg) within the first 3 h of admission to the MICU. Our 
approach is expected to significantly reduce the mean SOFA score by 23.71%, 
enhancing patient outcomes.
CONCLUSION: Our RL-NN method offers an accurate, real-time approach to 
optimizing sepsis treatment and aligns with the 'Surviving Sepsis Campaign' 
guidelines. It also has the potential to be integrated with existing electronic 
health record (EHR) systems, guiding clinical decision-making and thereby 
improving patient prognosis.

Multi-gate Mixture of Multi-view Graph Contrastive Learning on Electronic Health 
Record.

Cao Y, Wang Q, Wang X, Peng D, Li P.

Electronic Health Record (EHR) is the digital form of patient visits containing 
various medical data, including diagnosis, treatment, and lab events. 
Representation learning of EHR with deep learning methods has been beneficial 
for patient-related prediction tasks. Recently, studies have focused on 
revealing the inherent graph structure between medical events in EHR. Graph 
neural network (GNN) methods are prevalent and perform well in various 
prediction tasks. However, the inherent relationships between various medical 
events must be marked, which is complicated and time-consuming. Most research 
works adopt the straightforward structure of GNN models on a single prediction 
task which could not fully exploit the potential of EHR representations. 
Compared with previous work, the multi-task prediction could utilize the latent 
information of concealed correlations between different prediction tasks. In 
addition, self-contrastive learning on graphs could improve the representation 
learned by GNN. We propose a multi-gate mixture of multi-view graph contrastive 
learning (MMMGCL) method, aiming to get a more reasonable EHR representation and 
improve the performances of downstream tasks. First, each patient visit is 
represented as a graph with a well-designed hierarchically fully-connected 
pattern. Second, node features in the manually constructed graph are pre-trained 
via the Glove method with hierarchical ontology knowledge. Finally, MMMGCL 
processes the pre-trained graph and adopts a joint learning strategy to 
simultaneously optimize task and contrastive losses. We verify our method on two 
large open-source medical datasets, Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care 
(MIMIC-III) and the eICU Collaborative Research Database (eICU). Experiment 
results show that our method could improve performance compared to 
straightforward graph-based methods on prediction tasks of patient readmission, 
mortality, and length of stay.

OBJECTIVE: Weaning is an essential issue in critical care. This study explores 
the efficacy of multitask learning models in predicting successful weaning in 
critically ill ventilated patients using the Medical Information Mart for 
Intensive Care (MIMIC) IV database.
METHODS: We employed a multitask learning framework with a shared bottom network 
to facilitate common knowledge extraction across all tasks. We used the Shapley 
additive explanations (SHAP) plot and partial dependence plot (PDP) for model 
explainability. Furthermore, we conducted an error analysis to assess the 
strength and limitation of the model. Area under receiver operating 
characteristic curve (AUROC), calibration plot and decision curve analysis were 
used to determine the performance of the model.
RESULTS: A total of 7758 critically ill patients were included in the analyses, 
and 78.5% of them were successfully weaned. Multitask learning combined with 
spontaneous breath trial achieved a higher performance to predict successful 
weaning compared with multitask learning combined with shock and mortality (area 
under receiver operating characteristic curve, AUROC, 0.820 ± 0.002 vs 
0.817 ± 0.001, p < 0.001). We assessed the performance of the model using 
calibration and decision curve analyses and further interpreted the model 
through SHAP and PDP plots. The error analysis identified a relatively high 
error rate among those with low disease severities, including low mean airway 
pressure and high enteral feeding.
CONCLUSION: We demonstrated that multitask machine learning increased predictive 
accuracy for successful weaning through combining tasks with a high inter-task 
relationship. The model explainability and error analysis should enhance trust 
in the model.

BACKGROUND: Diastolic heart failure (DHF) and type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) 
often coexist, causing increased mortality rates. Glycaemic variability (GV) 
exacerbates cardiovascular complications, but its impact on outcomes in patients 
with DHF and T2DM remains unclear. This study examined the relationships between 
GV with mortality outcomes, and developed a machine learning (ML) model for 
long-term mortality in these patients.
METHODS: Patients with DHF and T2DM were included from the Medical Information 
Mart for Intensive Care IV, with admissions (2008-2019) as primary analysis 
cohort and admissions (2020-2022) as external validation cohort. Multivariate 
Cox proportional hazards models and restricted cubic spline analyses were used 
to evaluate the associations of GV with 90-day, 1-year, and 3-year all-cause 
mortality. The primary analysis cohort was split into training and internal 
validation cohorts, then developing ML models for predicting 1-year all-cause 
mortality in training cohort, which were validated using the internal and 
external validation cohorts.
RESULTS: 2,128 patients with DHF and T2DM were included in primary analysis 
cohort (meidian age 71.0years [IQR: 62.0-79.0]; 46.9% male), 498 patients with 
DHF and T2DM were included in the external validation cohort (meidian age 
75.0years [IQR: 67.0-81.0]; 54.0% male). Multivariate Cox proportional hazards 
models showed that high GV tertiles were associated with higher risk of 90-day 
(T2: HR 1.45, 95%CI 1.09-1.93; T3: HR 1.96, 95%CI 1.48-2.60), 1-year (T2: HR 
1.25, 95%CI 1.02-1.53; T3: HR 1.54, 95%CI 1.26-1.89), and 3-year (T2: HR 1.31, 
95%CI: 1.10-1.56; T3: HR 1.48, 95%CI 1.23-1.77) all-cause mortality, compared 
with lowest GV tertile. Chronic kidney disease, creatinine, potassium, 
haemoglobin, and white blood cell were identified as mediators of GV and 1-year 
all-cause mortality. Additionally, GV and other clinical features were 
pre-selected to construct ML models. The random forest model performed best, 
with AUC (0.770) and G-mean (0.591) in internal validation, with AUC (0.753) and 
G-mean (0.599) in external validation.
CONCLUSION: GV was determined as an independent risk factor for short-term and 
long-term all-cause mortality in patients with DHF and T2DM, with a potential 
intervention threshold around 25.0%. The ML model incorporating GV demonstrated 
strong predictive performance for 1-year all-cause mortality, highlighting its 
importance in early risk stratification management of these patients.

BACKGROUND: Postoperative fever is common. However, it can sometimes indicate 
severe complications such as sepsis or pneumonia. Intensive care unit (ICU) 
patients who have undergone abdominal surgery have a higher risk of 
postoperative fever due the physical severity of this type of surgery. 
Nevertheless, determining when more aggressive or invasive management of fever 
is necessary remains a challenge.
METHODS: We analyzed the Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care (MIMIC)-IV 
and MIMIC-IV-Note databases, which are open critical care big databases from a 
single institute in the United States. From this, we selected ICU patients who 
developed fever after intra-abdominal surgery and classified these patients into 
two groups using cluster analysis based on diverse variables from the MIMIC-IV 
databases. Following this cluster analysis, we assessed differences among the 
identified groups.
RESULTS: Of 2,858 ICU stays after intra-abdominal surgery, 331 postoperative 
fever cases were identified. These patients were clustered into two groups. 
Group A included older patients with a higher mortality rate, while group B 
consisted of younger patients with a lower mortality rate.
CONCLUSIONS: Postoperative ICU patients with a fever could be classified into 
two distinct groups, a high-risk group and low-risk group. The high-risk patient 
group was characterized by older age, higher Sequential Organ Failure Assessment 
(SOFA) score, and more unstable hemodynamic status, indicating the need for 
aggressive management. Clustering postoperative fever patients by clinical 
variables can support medical decision-making and targeted treatment to improve 
patient outcomes.

BACKGROUND: Supervised machine learning (ML) is being featured in the health 
care literature with study results frequently reported using metrics such as 
accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, recall, or F1 score. Although each metric 
provides a different perspective on the performance, they remain to be overall 
measures for the whole sample, discounting the uniqueness of each case or 
patient. Intuitively, we know that all cases are not equal, but the present 
evaluative approaches do not take case difficulty into account.
OBJECTIVE: A more case-based, comprehensive approach is warranted to assess 
supervised ML outcomes and forms the rationale for this study. This study aims 
to demonstrate how the item response theory (IRT) can be used to stratify the 
data based on how difficult each case is to classify, independent of the outcome 
measure of interest (eg, accuracy). This stratification allows the evaluation of 
ML classifiers to take the form of a distribution rather than a single scalar 
value.
METHODS: Two large, public intensive care unit data sets, Medical Information 
Mart for Intensive Care III and electronic intensive care unit, were used to 
showcase this method in predicting mortality. For each data set, a balanced 
sample (n=8078 and n=21,940, respectively) and an imbalanced sample (n=12,117 
and n=32,910, respectively) were drawn. A 2-parameter logistic model was used to 
provide scores for each case. Several ML algorithms were used in the 
demonstration to classify cases based on their health-related features: logistic 
regression, linear discriminant analysis, K-nearest neighbors, decision tree, 
naive Bayes, and a neural network. Generalized linear mixed model analyses were 
used to assess the effects of case difficulty strata, ML algorithm, and the 
interaction between them in predicting accuracy.
RESULTS: The results showed significant effects (P<.001) for case difficulty 
strata, ML algorithm, and their interaction in predicting accuracy and 
illustrated that all classifiers performed better with easier-to-classify cases 
and that overall the neural network performed best. Significant interactions 
suggest that cases that fall in the most arduous strata should be handled by 
logistic regression, linear discriminant analysis, decision tree, or neural 
network but not by naive Bayes or K-nearest neighbors. Conventional metrics for 
ML classification have been reported for methodological comparison.
CONCLUSIONS: This demonstration shows that using the IRT is a viable method for 
understanding the data that are provided to ML algorithms, independent of 
outcome measures, and highlights how well classifiers differentiate cases of 
varying difficulty. This method explains which features are indicative of 
healthy states and why. It enables end users to tailor the classifier that is 
appropriate to the difficulty level of the patient for personalized medicine.

OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to develop and validate several artificial 
intelligence (AI) models to identify acute myocardial infarction (AMI) patients 
at an increased risk of acute kidney injury (AKI) during hospitalization.
METHODS: Included were patients diagnosed with AMI from the Medical Information 
Mart for Intensive Care (MIMIC) III and IV databases. Two cohorts of AMI 
patients from Changzhou Second People's Hospital and Xuzhou Center Hospital were 
used for external validation of the models. Patients' demographics, vital signs, 
clinical characteristics, laboratory results, and therapeutic measures were 
extracted. Totally, 12 AI models were developed. The area under the receiver 
operating characteristic curve (AUC) were calculated and compared.
RESULTS: AKI occurred during hospitalization in 1098 (28.3 %) of the 3882 final 
enrolled patients, split into training (3105) and test (777) sets randomly. 
Among them, Random Forest (RF), C5.0 and Bagged CART models outperformed the 
other models in both the training and test sets. The AUCs for the test set were 
0.754, 0.734 and 0.730, respectively. The incidence of AKI was 9.8 % and 9.5 % 
in 2202 patients in the Changzhou cohort and 807 patients in the Xuzhou cohort 
with AMI, respectively. The AUCs for patients in the Changzhou cohort were RF, 
0.761; C5.0, 0.733; and bagged CART, 0.725, respectively, and Xuzhou cohort were 
RF, 0.799; C5.0, 0.808; and bagged CART, 0.784, respectively.
CONCLUSION: Several machines learning-based prediction models for AKI after AMI 
were developed and validated. The RF, C5.0 and Bagged CART model performed 
robustly in identifying high-risk patients earlier.

OBJECTIVE: Acute kidney injury (AKI) poses a lethal risk in intensive care unit 
(ICU) patients, where early detection is challenging. This study was to 
establish a prediction model for AKI 24 hours in advance for ICU patients and to 
help clinicians monitor patients at an early stage by key features.
METHODS: In this study, the Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care (MIMIC) 
databases were used to construct a dataset of critically ill patients. 
Predictive models were constructed using five machine learning algorithms based 
on MIMIC-IV data, and the best predictive model was selected by multiple model 
evaluation metrics. MIMIC-III data were used for external validation. We 
conducted an interpretability analysis of the model using SHapley Additive 
exPlanations (SHAP) to clarify key features and decision-making mechanisms.
RESULTS: A total of 18,186 patient data were included in this study. The 
analysis combining calibration and decision curves demonstrated that the eXtreme 
Gradient Boosting (XGBoost) exhibited superior performance among the five 
algorithms, achieving an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve 
of 0.88. Interpretability analysis based on the XGBoost model showed diuretic 
use, mechanical ventilation, vasopressor use, age, and antibiotic use as the 
most important decision factors of the model. The SHAP summary plot was used to 
illustrate the effects of the top 19 features attributed to the XGBoost.
CONCLUSIONS: The XGBoost algorithm can predict the occurrence of AKI more 
accurately. Interpretative analysis of the model reveals the mechanisms of key 
features, and reflects the individual differences between patients, providing an 
important clinical reference.

BACKGROUND: Diagnostic errors pose significant health risks and contribute to 
patient mortality. With the growing accessibility of electronic health records, 
machine learning models offer a promising avenue for enhancing diagnosis 
quality. Current research has primarily focused on a limited set of diseases 
with ample training data, neglecting diagnostic scenarios with limited data 
availability.
OBJECTIVE: This study aims to develop an information retrieval (IR)-based 
framework that accommodates data sparsity to facilitate broader diagnostic 
decision support.
METHODS: We introduced an IR-based diagnostic decision support framework called 
CliniqIR. It uses clinical text records, the Unified Medical Language System 
Metathesaurus, and 33 million PubMed abstracts to classify a broad spectrum of 
diagnoses independent of training data availability. CliniqIR is designed to be 
compatible with any IR framework. Therefore, we implemented it using both dense 
and sparse retrieval approaches. We compared CliniqIR's performance to that of 
pretrained clinical transformer models such as Clinical Bidirectional Encoder 
Representations from Transformers (ClinicalBERT) in supervised and zero-shot 
settings. Subsequently, we combined the strength of supervised fine-tuned 
ClinicalBERT and CliniqIR to build an ensemble framework that delivers 
state-of-the-art diagnostic predictions.
RESULTS: On a complex diagnosis data set (DC3) without any training data, 
CliniqIR models returned the correct diagnosis within their top 3 predictions. 
On the Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care III data set, CliniqIR models 
surpassed ClinicalBERT in predicting diagnoses with <5 training samples by an 
average difference in mean reciprocal rank of 0.10. In a zero-shot setting where 
models received no disease-specific training, CliniqIR still outperformed the 
pretrained transformer models with a greater mean reciprocal rank of at least 
0.10. Furthermore, in most conditions, our ensemble framework surpassed the 
performance of its individual components, demonstrating its enhanced ability to 
make precise diagnostic predictions.
CONCLUSIONS: Our experiments highlight the importance of IR in leveraging 
unstructured knowledge resources to identify infrequently encountered diagnoses. 
In addition, our ensemble framework benefits from combining the complementary 
strengths of the supervised and retrieval-based models to diagnose a broad 
spectrum of diseases.

BACKGROUND: Upper gastrointestinal (GI) bleeding is a common medical emergency. 
This study aimed to develop models to predict critically ill patients with upper 
GI bleeding in-hospital and 30-day survival, identify the correlation factor and 
infer the causality.
METHODS: A total of 2898 patients with upper GI bleeding were included from the 
Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care-IV and eICU-Collaborative Research 
Database, respectively. To identify the most critical factors contributing to 
the prognostic model, we used SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations) for machine 
learning interpretability. We performed causal inference using inverse 
probability weighting for survival-associated prognostic factors.
RESULTS: The optimal model using the light GBM (gradient boosting algorithm) 
algorithm achieved an AUC of .93 for in-hospital survival, .81 for 30-day 
survival in internal testing and .87 for in-hospital survival in external 
testing. Important factors for in-hospital survival, according to SHAP, were 
SOFA (Sequential organ failure assessment score), GCS (Glasgow coma scale) motor 
score and length of stay in ICU (Intensive critical care). In contrast, 
essential factors for 30-day survival were SOFA, length of stay in ICU, total 
bilirubin and GCS verbal score. Our model showed improved performance compared 
to SOFA alone.
CONCLUSIONS: Our interpretable machine learning model for predicting in-hospital 
and 30-day mortality in critically ill patients with upper gastrointestinal 
bleeding showed excellent accuracy and high generalizability. This model can 
assist clinicians in managing these patients to improve the discrimination of 
high-risk patients.

Background Atrial fibrillation (AFIB) is a common atrial arrhythmia that affects 
millions of people worldwide. However, most of the time, AFIB is paroxysmal and 
can pass unnoticed in medical exams; therefore, regular screening is required. 
This paper proposes machine learning (ML) methods to detect AFIB from short-term 
electrocardiogram (ECG) and photoplethysmography (PPG) signals. Aim Several 
experiments were conducted across five different databases, with three of them 
containing ECG signals and the other two consisting of only PPG signals. 
Experiments were conducted to investigate the hypothesis that an ML model 
trained to predict AFIB from ECG segments could be used to predict AFIB from PPG 
segments. Materials and methods A random forest (RF) ML algorithm achieved the 
best accuracy and achieved a 90% accuracy rate on the University of Mississippi 
Medical Center (UMMC) dataset (216 samples) and a 97% accuracy rate on the 
Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care (MIMIC)-III datasets (2,134 
samples). Results A total of 269,842 signal segments were analyzed across all 
datasets (212,266 were of normal sinus rhythm (NSR) and 57,576 corresponded to 
AFIB segments). Conclusions The ability to detect AFIB with significant accuracy 
using ML algorithms from PPG signals, which can be acquired via non-invasive 
contact or contactless, is a promising step forward toward the goal of achieving 
large-scale screening for AFIB.

BACKGROUND: This study aimed to develop and validate a model for mortality risk 
stratification of intensive care unit (ICU) patients with acute kidney injury 
(AKI) using the machine learning technique.
METHODS: Eligible data were extracted from the Medical Information Mart for 
Intensive Care (MIMIC-III) database. Calibration, discrimination, and risk 
classification for mortality prediction were evaluated using conventional 
scoring systems and the new algorithm. A 10-fold cross-validation was performed. 
The predictive models were externally validated using the eICU database and also 
patients treated at the Second People's Hospital of Shenzhen between January 
2015 to October 2018.
RESULTS: For the new model, the areas under the receiver operating 
characteristic curves (AUROCs) for mortality during hospitalization and at 28 
and 90 days after discharge were 0.91, 0.87, and 0.87, respectively, which were 
higher than for the Simplified Acute Physiology Score (SAPS II) and Sequential 
Organ Failure Assessment (SOFA). For external validation, the AUROC was 0.82 for 
in-hospital mortality, higher than SOFA, SAPS II, and Acute Physiology and 
Chronic Health Evaluation (APACHE) IV in the eICU database, but for the 28- and 
90-day mortality, the new model had AUROCs (0.79 and 0.80, respectively) similar 
to that of SAPS II in the SZ2 database. The reclassification indexes were 
superior for the new model compared with the conventional scoring systems.
CONCLUSIONS: The new risk stratification model shows high performance in 
predicting mortality in ICU patients with AKI.

Sepsis is a leading cause of mortality in the intensive care unit. Early 
prediction of sepsis can reduce the overall mortality rate and cost of sepsis 
treatment. Some studies have predicted mortality and development of sepsis using 
machine learning models. However, there is a gap between the creation of 
different machine learning algorithms and their implementation in clinical 
practice.This study utilized data from the Medical Information Mart for 
Intensive Care III. We established and compared the gradient boosting decision 
tree (GBDT), logistic regression (LR), k-nearest neighbor (KNN), random forest 
(RF), and support vector machine (SVM).A total of 3937 sepsis patients were 
included, with 34.3% mortality in the Medical Information Mart for Intensive 
Care III group. In our comparison of 5 machine learning models (GBDT, LR, KNN, 
RF, and SVM), the GBDT model showed the best performance with the highest area 
under the receiver operating characteristic curve (0.992), recall (94.8%), 
accuracy (95.4%), and F1 score (0.933). The RF, SVM, and KNN models showed 
better performance (area under the receiver operating characteristic curve: 
0.980, 0.898, and 0.877, respectively) than the LR (0.876).The GBDT model showed 
better performance than other machine learning models (LR, KNN, RF, and SVM) in 
predicting the mortality of patients with sepsis in the intensive care unit. 
This could be used to develop a clinical decision support system in the future.

BACKGROUND: Racial disparities in health care are well documented in the United 
States. As machine learning methods become more common in health care settings, 
it is important to ensure that these methods do not contribute to racial 
disparities through biased predictions or differential accuracy across racial 
groups.
OBJECTIVE: The goal of the research was to assess a machine learning algorithm 
intentionally developed to minimize bias in in-hospital mortality predictions 
between white and nonwhite patient groups.
METHODS: Bias was minimized through preprocessing of algorithm training data. We 
performed a retrospective analysis of electronic health record data from 
patients admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) at a large academic health 
center between 2001 and 2012, drawing data from the Medical Information Mart for 
Intensive Care-III database. Patients were included if they had at least 10 
hours of available measurements after ICU admission, had at least one of every 
measurement used for model prediction, and had recorded race/ethnicity data. 
Bias was assessed through the equal opportunity difference. Model performance in 
terms of bias and accuracy was compared with the Modified Early Warning Score 
(MEWS), the Simplified Acute Physiology Score II (SAPS II), and the Acute 
Physiologic Assessment and Chronic Health Evaluation (APACHE).
RESULTS: The machine learning algorithm was found to be more accurate than all 
comparators, with a higher sensitivity, specificity, and area under the receiver 
operating characteristic. The machine learning algorithm was found to be 
unbiased (equal opportunity difference 0.016, P=.20). APACHE was also found to 
be unbiased (equal opportunity difference 0.019, P=.11), while SAPS II and MEWS 
were found to have significant bias (equal opportunity difference 0.038, P=.006 
and equal opportunity difference 0.074, P<.001, respectively).
CONCLUSIONS: This study indicates there may be significant racial bias in 
commonly used severity scoring systems and that machine learning algorithms may 
reduce bias while improving on the accuracy of these methods.

OBJECTIVE: Recent studies on electronic health records (EHRs) started to learn 
deep generative models and synthesize a huge amount of realistic records, in 
order to address significant privacy issues surrounding the EHR. However, most 
of them only focus on structured records about patients' independent visits, 
rather than on chronological clinical records. In this article, we aim to learn 
and synthesize realistic sequences of EHRs based on the generative autoencoder.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: We propose a dual adversarial autoencoder (DAAE), which 
learns set-valued sequences of medical entities, by combining a recurrent 
autoencoder with 2 generative adversarial networks (GANs). DAAE improves the 
mode coverage and quality of generated sequences by adversarially learning both 
the continuous latent distribution and the discrete data distribution. Using the 
MIMIC-III (Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care-III) and UT Physicians 
clinical databases, we evaluated the performances of DAAE in terms of predictive 
modeling, plausibility, and privacy preservation.
RESULTS: Our generated sequences of EHRs showed the comparable performances to 
real data for a predictive modeling task, and achieved the best score in 
plausibility evaluation conducted by medical experts among all baseline models. 
In addition, differentially private optimization of our model enables to 
generate synthetic sequences without increasing the privacy leakage of patients' 
data.
CONCLUSIONS: DAAE can effectively synthesize sequential EHRs by addressing its 
main challenges: the synthetic records should be realistic enough not to be 
distinguished from the real records, and they should cover all the training 
patients to reproduce the performance of specific downstream tasks.

Background: The number of geriatric traumatic brain injury (TBI) patients is 
increasing every year due to the population’s aging in most of the developed 
countries. Unfortunately, there is no widely recognized tool for specifically 
evaluating the prognosis of geriatric TBI patients. We designed this study to 
compare the prognostic value of different machine learning algorithm-based 
predictive models for geriatric TBI. Methods: TBI patients aged ≥65 from the 
Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care-III (MIMIC-III) database were 
eligible for this study. To develop and validate machine learning 
algorithm-based prognostic models, included patients were divided into a 
training set and a testing set, with a ratio of 7:3. The predictive value of 
different machine learning based models was evaluated by calculating the area 
under the receiver operating characteristic curve, sensitivity, specificity, 
accuracy and F score. Results: A total of 1123 geriatric TBI patients were 
included, with a mortality of 24.8%. Non-survivors had higher age (82.2 vs. 
80.7, p = 0.010) and lower Glasgow Coma Scale (14 vs. 7, p < 0.001) than 
survivors. The rate of mechanical ventilation was significantly higher (67.6% 
vs. 25.9%, p < 0.001) in non-survivors while the rate of neurosurgical operation 
did not differ between survivors and non-survivors (24.3% vs. 23.0%, p = 0.735). 
Among different machine learning algorithms, Adaboost (AUC: 0.799) and Random 
Forest (AUC: 0.795) performed slightly better than the logistic regression (AUC: 
0.792) on predicting mortality in geriatric TBI patients in the testing set. 
Conclusion: Adaboost, Random Forest and logistic regression all performed well 
in predicting mortality of geriatric TBI patients. Prognostication tools 
utilizing these algorithms are helpful for physicians to evaluate the risk of 
poor outcomes in geriatric TBI patients and adopt personalized therapeutic 
options for them.

INTRODUCTION: Sepsis is associated to a high mortality rate, and its severity 
must be evaluated quickly. The severity of illness scores used are intended to 
be applicable to all patient populations, and generally evaluate in-hospital 
mortality. However, patients with sepsis continue to be at risk of death after 
hospital discharge.
OBJECTIVE: To develop a model for predicting 1-year mortality in critical 
patients diagnosed with sepsis.
PATIENTS: The data corresponding to 5650 admissions of patients with sepsis from 
the Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care (MIMIC-III) database were 
evaluated, randomly divided as follows: 70% for training and 30% for validation.
DESIGN: A retrospective register-based cohort study was carried out. The 
clinical information of the first 24h after admission was used to develop a 
1-year mortality prediction model based on Stochastic Gradient Boosting (SGB) 
methodology. Variable selection was addressed using Least Absolute Shrinkage and 
Selection Operator (LASSO) and SGB variable importance methodologies. The 
predictive power was evaluated using the area under the ROC curve (AUROC).
RESULTS: An AUROC of 0.8039 (95% confidence interval (CI): [0.8033 0.8045]) was 
obtained in the validation subset. The model exceeded the predictive 
performances obtained with traditional severity of disease scores in the same 
subset.
CONCLUSION: The use of assembly algorithms, such as SGB, for the generation of a 
customized model for sepsis yields more accurate 1-year mortality prediction 
than the traditional scoring systems such as SAPS II, SOFA or OASIS.

OBJECTIVE: This study developed and validated a stacked ensemble machine 
learning model to predict the risk of acute kidney injury in patients with acute 
pancreatitis complicated by sepsis.
DESIGN: A retrospective study based on patient data from public databases.
PARTICIPANTS: This study analysed 1295 patients with acute pancreatitis 
complicated by septicaemia from the US Intensive Care Database.
METHODS: From the MIMIC database, data of patients with acute pancreatitis and 
sepsis were obtained to construct machine learning models, which were internally 
and externally validated. The Boruta algorithm was used to select variables. 
Then, eight machine learning algorithms were used to construct prediction models 
for acute kidney injury (AKI) occurrence in intensive care unit (ICU) patients. 
A new stacked ensemble model was developed using the Stacking ensemble method. 
Model evaluation was performed using area under the receiver operating 
characteristic curve (AUC), precision-recall (PR) curve, accuracy, recall and F1 
score. The Shapley additive explanation (SHAP) method was used to explain the 
models.
MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: AKI in patients with acute pancreatitis complicated by 
sepsis.
RESULTS: The final study included 1295 patients with acute pancreatitis 
complicated by sepsis, among whom 893 cases (68.9%) developed acute kidney 
injury. We established eight base models, including Logit, SVM, CatBoost, RF, 
XGBoost, LightGBM, AdaBoost and MLP, as well as a stacked ensemble model called 
Multimodel. Among all models, Multimodel had an AUC value of 0.853 (95% CI: 
0.792 to 0.896) in the internal validation dataset and 0.802 (95% CI: 0.732 to 
0.861) in the external validation dataset. This model demonstrated the best 
predictive performance in terms of discrimination and clinical application.
CONCLUSION: The stack ensemble model developed by us achieved AUC values of 
0.853 and 0.802 in internal and external validation cohorts respectively and 
also demonstrated excellent performance in other metrics. It serves as a 
reliable tool for predicting AKI in patients with acute pancreatitis complicated 
by sepsis.

BACKGROUND: Understanding the multifaceted nature of health outcomes requires a 
comprehensive examination of the social, economic, and environmental 
determinants that shape individual well-being. Among these determinants, 
behavioral factors play a crucial role, particularly the consumption patterns of 
psychoactive substances, which have important implications on public health. The 
Global Burden of Disease Study shows a growing impact in disability-adjusted 
life years due to substance use. The successful identification of patients' 
substance use information equips clinical care teams to address 
substance-related issues more effectively, enabling targeted support and 
ultimately improving patient outcomes.
OBJECTIVE: Traditional natural language processing methods face limitations in 
accurately parsing diverse clinical language associated with substance use. 
Large language models offer promise in overcoming these challenges by adapting 
to diverse language patterns. This study investigates the application of the 
generative pretrained transformer (GPT) model in specific GPT-3.5 for extracting 
tobacco, alcohol, and substance use information from patient discharge summaries 
in zero-shot and few-shot learning settings. This study contributes to the 
evolving landscape of health care informatics by showcasing the potential of 
advanced language models in extracting nuanced information critical for 
enhancing patient care.
METHODS: The main data source for analysis in this paper is Medical Information 
Mart for Intensive Care III data set. Among all notes in this data set, we 
focused on discharge summaries. Prompt engineering was undertaken, involving an 
iterative exploration of diverse prompts. Leveraging carefully curated examples 
and refined prompts, we investigate the model's proficiency through zero-shot as 
well as few-shot prompting strategies.
RESULTS: Results show GPT's varying effectiveness in identifying mentions of 
tobacco, alcohol, and substance use across learning scenarios. Zero-shot 
learning showed high accuracy in identifying substance use, whereas few-shot 
learning reduced accuracy but improved in identifying substance use status, 
enhancing recall and F1-score at the expense of lower precision.
CONCLUSIONS: Excellence of zero-shot learning in precisely extracting text span 
mentioning substance use demonstrates its effectiveness in situations in which 
comprehensive recall is important. Conversely, few-shot learning offers 
advantages when accurately determining the status of substance use is the 
primary focus, even if it involves a trade-off in precision. The results 
contribute to enhancement of early detection and intervention strategies, tailor 
treatment plans with greater precision, and ultimately, contribute to a holistic 
understanding of patient health profiles. By integrating these artificial 
intelligence-driven methods into electronic health record systems, clinicians 
can gain immediate, comprehensive insights into substance use that results in 
shaping interventions that are not only timely but also more personalized and 
effective.

Hepatorenal syndrome (HRS) is a key contributor to poor prognosis in liver 
cirrhosis. This study aims to leverage the database to build a predictive model 
for early identification of high-risk patients. From two sizable public 
databases, we retrieved pertinent information about the cirrhosis patients' 
therapies, comorbidities, laboratory results, and demographics. Patients from 
the eICU database served as a test set for external validation, while patients 
from the MIMIC database were divided into training and validation groups. 
Variables were screened using LASSO regression, Extreme Gradient Boosting (XG 
Boost), and Random Forest (RF). Core risk factors were determined from the 
intersection of the three methods. A predictive model was constructed using 
multivariable logistic regression and visualized via a nomogram. Model 
performance was assessed using ROC curves, decision curve analysis (DCA), 
clinical impact curves (CIC), and calibration curves. Eight critical variables 
associated with HRS were identified using machine learning methods. The final 
predictive model, based on five key variables-spontaneous bacterial peritonitis, 
red blood cell count, creatinine, activated partial thromboplastin time, and 
total bilirubin-showed excellent discrimination, with AUCs of 0.832 (95% CI 
0.8069-0.8563) in the training set and 0.8415 (95% CI 0.8042-0.8789) in the 
validation set. The AUC in the external test set was 0.8212 (95% CI 
0.7784-0.864). By integrating the MIMIC-IV database and machine learning 
algorithms, we developed an effective predictive model for HRS in liver 
cirrhosis patients, providing a robust tool for early clinical intervention.

The predictive Intensive Care Unit (ICU) scoring system plays an important role 
in ICU management for its capability of predicting important outcomes, 
especially mortality. There are many scoring systems that have been developed 
and used in the ICU. These scoring systems are primarily based on the structured 
clinical data contained in the electronic health record (EHR), which may suffer 
the loss of the important clinical information contained in the narratives and 
images. In this work, we build a deep learning based survival prediction model 
with multi-modality data to predict ICU-mortality. Four sets of features are 
investigated: (1) physiological measurements of Simplified Acute Physiology 
Score (SAPS) II, (2) common thorax diseases pre-defined by radiologists, (3) 
BERT-based text representations, and (4) chest X-ray image features. We use the 
Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care IV (MIMIC-IV) dataset to evaluate 
the proposed model. Our model achieves the average C-index of 0.7847 (95% 
confidence interval, 0.7625-0.8068), which substantially exceeds that of the 
baseline with SAPS-II features (0.7477 (0.7238-0.7716)). Ablation studies 
further demonstrate the contributions of pre-defined labels (2.12%), text 
features (2.68%), and image features (2.96%). Our model achieves a higher 
average C-index than the traditional machine learning methods under the same 
feature fusion setting, which suggests that the deep learning methods can 
outperform the traditional machine learning methods in ICU-mortality prediction. 
These results highlight the potential of deep learning models with multimodal 
information to enhance ICU-mortality prediction. We make our work publicly 
available at https://github.com/bionlplab/mimic-icu-mortality.

We determined the relative strengths of association between 23 most commonly 
ordered laboratory tests and the adverse outcome as indicators of relative 
criticalness. The lowest and highest results for 23 most commonly ordered 
laboratory tests, 24 hours prior to death during critical care unit (CCU) stay 
or discharge from CCU were extracted from a publicly available CCU database 
(Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care-III). Following this, the Random 
Forest model was applied to assess the association between the laboratory 
results and the outcomes (death or discharge). The mean decrease in Gini 
coefficient for each laboratory test was then ranked as an indication of their 
relative importance to the outcome of a patient. In descending order, the 10 
laboratory tests with the strongest association with death were: bicarbonate, 
phosphate, anion gap, white cell count (total), partial thromboplastin time, 
platelet, total calcium, chloride, glucose and INR; moreover, the strength of 
association was different for critically high versus low results.

Given the limited capacity to accurately determine the necessity for intubation 
in intensive care unit settings, this study aimed to develop and externally 
validate an interpretable machine learning model capable of predicting the need 
for intubation among ICU patients. Seven widely used machine learning (ML) 
algorithms were employed to construct the prediction models. Adult patients from 
the Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care IV database who stayed in the 
ICU for longer than 24 h were included in the development and internal 
validation. The model was subsequently externally validated using the eICU-CRD 
database. In addition, the SHapley Additive exPlanations method was employed to 
interpret the influence of individual parameters on the predictions made by the 
model. A total of 11,988 patients were included in the final cohort for this 
study. The CatBoost model demonstrated the best performance (AUC: 0.881). In the 
external validation set, the efficacy of our model was also confirmed (AUC: 
0.750), which suggests robust generalization capabilities. The Glasgow Coma 
Scale (GCS), body mass index (BMI), arterial partial pressure of oxygen (PaO2), 
respiratory rate (RR) and length of stay (LOS) before ICU were the top 5 
features of the CatBoost model with the greatest impact. We developed an 
externally validated CatBoost model that accurately predicts the need for 
intubation in ICU patients within 24 to 96 h of admission, facilitating clinical 
decision-making and has the potential to improve patient outcomes. The 
prediction model utilizes readily obtainable monitoring parameters and

OBJECTIVES: Developing and validating interpretable machine learning (ML) models 
for predicting whether triaged patients need to be admitted to the intensive 
care unit (ICU).
MEASURES: The study analyzed 189,167 emergency patients from the Medical 
Information Mart for Intensive Care IV database, with the outcome being ICU 
admission. Three models were compared: Model 1 based on Emergency Severity Index 
(ESI), Model 2 on vital signs, and Model 3 on vital signs, demographic 
characteristics, medical history, and chief complaints. Nine ML algorithms were 
employed. The area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC), F1 
Score, Positive Predictive Value, Negative Predictive Value, Brier score, 
calibration curves, and decision curves analysis were used to evaluate the 
performance of the models. SHapley Additive exPlanations was used for explaining 
ML models.
RESULTS: The AUC of Model 3 was superior to that of Model 1 and Model 2. In 
Model 3, the top four algorithms with the highest AUC were Gradient Boosting 
(0.81), Logistic Regression (0.81), naive Bayes (0.80), and Random Forest 
(0.80). Upon further comparison of the four algorithms, Gradient Boosting was 
slightly superior to Random Forest and Logistic Regression, while naive Bayes 
performed the worst.
CONCLUSIONS: This study developed an interpretable ML triage model using vital 
signs, demographics, medical history, and chief complaints, proving more 
effective than traditional models in predicting ICU admission. Interpretable ML 
aids clinical decisions during triage.

OBJECTIVE: Clinical notes contain information that has not been documented 
elsewhere, including responses to treatment and clinical findings, which are 
crucial for predicting key outcomes in patients in acute care. In this study, we 
propose the automatic annotation of phenotypes from clinical notes as a method 
to capture essential information to predict outcomes in the intensive care unit 
(ICU). This information is complementary to typically used vital signs and 
laboratory test results.
METHODS: In this study, we developed a novel phenotype annotation model to 
extract the phenotypical features of patients, which were then used as input 
features of predictive models to predict ICU patient outcomes. We demonstrated 
and validated this approach by conducting experiments on three ICU prediction 
tasks, including in-hospital mortality, physiological decompensation and length 
of stay (LOS) for over 24 000 patients using the Medical Information Mart for 
Intensive Care (MIMIC-III) dataset.
RESULTS: The predictive models incorporating phenotypical information achieved 
0.845 (area under the curve-receiver operating characteristic (AUC-ROC)) for 
in-hospital mortality, 0.839 (AUC-ROC) for physiological decompensation and 
0.430 (kappa) for LOS, all of which consistently outperformed the baseline 
models using only vital signs and laboratory test results. Moreover, we 
conducted a thorough interpretability study showing that phenotypes provide 
valuable insights at both the patient and cohort levels.
CONCLUSION: The proposed approach demonstrates that phenotypical information 
complements traditionally used vital signs and laboratory test results and 
significantly improves the accuracy of outcome prediction in the ICU.

OBJECTIVE: To explore the optimal blood glucose-lowering strategies for patients 
with diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) to enhance personalized treatment effects using 
machine learning techniques based on the United States Critical Care Medical 
Information Mart for Intensive Care- IV (MIMIC- IV).
METHODS: Utilizing the MIMIC- IV database, the case data of 2 096 patients with 
DKA admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) at Beth Israel Deaconess Medical 
Center from 2008 to 2019 were analyzed. Machine learning models were developed, 
and receiver operator characteristic curve (ROC curve) and precision-recall 
curve (PR curve) were plotted to evaluate the model's effectiveness in 
predicting four common adverse outcomes: hypoglycemia, hypokalemia, reductions 
in Glasgow coma scale (GCS), and extended hospital stays. The risk of adverse 
outcomes was analyzed in relation to the rate of blood glucose decrease. 
Univariate and multivariate Logistic regression analyses were conducted to 
examine the relationship between relevant factors and the risk of hypokalemia. 
Personalized risk interpretation methods and predictive technologies were 
applied to individualize the analysis of optimal glucose control ranges for 
patients.
RESULTS: The machine learning models demonstrated excellent performance in 
predicting adverse outcomes in patients with DKA, with areas under the ROC curve 
(AUROC) and 95% confidence interval (95%CI) for predicting hypoglycemia, 
hypokalemia, GCS score reduction, and extended hospital stays being 0.826 
(0.803-0.849), 0.850 (0.828-0.870), 0.925 (0.903-0.946), and 0.901 
(0.883-0.920), respectively. Analysis of the relationship between the rate of 
blood glucose reduction and the risk of four adverse outcomes showed that a 
maximum glucose reduction rate > 6.26 mmol×L-1×h-1 significantly increased the 
risk of hypoglycemia (P < 0.001); a rate > 2.72 mmol×L-1×h-1 significantly 
elevated the risk of hypokalemia (P < 0.001); a rate > 5.53 mmol×L-1×h-1 
significantly reduced the risk of GCS score reduction (P < 0.001); and a rate > 
8.03 mmol×L-1×h-1 significantly shortened the length of hospital stay (P < 
0.001). Multivariate Logistic regression analysis indicated significant 
correlations between maximum bicarbonate levels, blood urea nitrogen levels, and 
total insulin doses with the risk of hypokalemia (all P < 0.01). In terms of 
establishing personalized optimal treatment thresholds, assuming optimal glucose 
reduction thresholds for hypoglycemia, hypokalemia, GCS score reduction, and 
extended hospital stay were x1, x2, x3, x4, respectively, the recommended 
glucose reduction rates to minimize the risks of hypokalemia and hypoglycemia 
should be ≤min{x1, x2}, while those to reduce GCS score decline and extended 
hospital stay should be ≥ max{x3, x4}. When these ranges overlap, i.e., max{x3, 
x4} ≤ min{x1, x2}, this interval was the recommended optimal glucose reduction 
range. If there was no overlap between these ranges, i.e., max{x3, x4} > min{x1, 
x2}, the treatment strategy should be dynamically adjusted considering 
individual differences in the risk of various adverse outcomes.
CONCLUSIONS: The machine learning models shows good performance in predicting 
adverse outcomes in patients with DKA, assisting in personalized blood glucose 
management and holding important clinical application prospects.

BACKGROUND: Multicenter electronic health records can support quality 
improvement and comparative effectiveness research in stroke. However, 
limitations of electronic health record-based research include challenges in 
abstracting key clinical variables, including stroke severity, along with 
missing data. We developed a natural language processing model that reads 
electronic health record notes to directly extract the National Institutes of 
Health Stroke Scale score when documented and predict the score from clinical 
documentation when missing.
METHODS AND RESULTS: The study included notes from patients with acute stroke 
(aged ≥18 years) admitted to Massachusetts General Hospital (2015-2022). The 
Massachusetts General Hospital data were divided into training/holdout test 
(70%/30%) sets. We developed a 2-stage model to predict the admission National 
Institutes of Health Stroke Scale, obtained from the GWTG (Get With The 
Guidelines) stroke registry. We trained a model with the least absolute 
shrinkage and selection operator. For test notes with documented National 
Institutes of Health Stroke Scale, scores were extracted using regular 
expressions (stage 1); when not documented, least absolute shrinkage and 
selection operator was used for prediction (stage 2). The 2-stage model was 
tested on the holdout test set and validated in the Medical Information Mart for 
Intensive Care (2001-2012) version 1.4, using root mean squared error and 
Spearman correlation. We included 4163 patients (Massachusetts General Hospital, 
3876; Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care, 287); average age, 69 (SD, 
15) years; 53% men, and 72% White individuals. The model achieved a root mean 
squared error of 2.89 (95% CI, 2.62-3.19) and Spearman correlation of 0.92 (95% 
CI, 0.91-0.93) in the Massachusetts General Hospital test set, and 2.20 (95% CI, 
1.69-2.66) and 0.96 (95% CI, 0.94-0.97) in the MIMIC validation set, 
respectively.
CONCLUSIONS: The automatic natural language processing-based model can enable 
large-scale stroke severity phenotyping from the electronic health record and 
support real-world quality improvement and comparative effectiveness studies in 
stroke.

OBJECTIVE: We identified predictive factors and developed a novel machine 
learning (ML) model for predicting mortality risk in patients with 
sepsis-associated encephalopathy (SAE).
METHODS: In this retrospective cohort study, data from the Medical Information 
Mart for Intensive Care IV (MIMIC-IV) and eICU Collaborative Research Database 
were used for model development and external validation. The primary outcome was 
the in-hospital mortality rate among patients with SAE; the observed in-hospital 
mortality rate was 14.74% (MIMIC IV: 1112, eICU: 594). Using the least absolute 
shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO), we built nine ML models and a stacking 
ensemble model and determined the optimal model based on the area under the 
receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC). We used the Shapley additive 
explanations (SHAP) algorithm to determine the optimal model.
RESULTS: The study included 9943 patients. LASSO identified 15 variables. The 
stacking ensemble model achieved the highest AUC on the test set (0.807) and 
0.671 on external validation. SHAP analysis highlighted Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) 
and age as key variables. The model (https://sic1.shinyapps.io/SSAAEE/) can 
predict in-hospital mortality risk for patients with SAE.
CONCLUSIONS: We developed a stacked ensemble model with enhanced generalization 
capabilities using novel data to predict mortality risk in patients with SAE.

INTRODUCTION: Heart failure (HF) may induce bowel hypoperfusion, leading to 
hypoxia of the villa of the bowel wall and the occurrence of Clostridioides 
difficile infection (CDI). However, the risk factors for the development of CDI 
in HF patients have yet to be fully illustrated, especially because of a lack of 
evidence from real-world data.
METHODS: Clinical data and survival situations of HF patients with CDI admitted 
to ICU were extracted from the Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care 
(MIMIC)-IV database. For developing a model that can predict 28-day all-cause 
mortality in HF patients with CDI, the Recursive Feature Elimination with 
Cross-Validation (RFE-CV) method was used for feature selection. And nine 
machine learning (ML) algorithms, including logistic regression (LR), decision 
tree, Bayesian, adaptive boosting, random forest (RF), gradient boosting 
decision tree, XGBoost, light gradient boosting machine, and categorical 
boosting, were applied for model construction. After training and hyperparameter 
optimization of the models through grid search 5-fold cross-validation, the 
performance of models was evaluated by the area under curve (AUC), accuracy, 
sensitivity, specificity, precision, negative predictive value, and F1 score. 
Furthermore, the SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) method was used to 
interpret the optimal model.
RESULTS: A total of 526 HF patients with CDI were included in the study, of whom 
99 cases (18.8%) experienced death within 28 days. Eighteen of the 57 variables 
were selected for the model construction algorithm for model construction. Among 
the ML models considered, the RF model emerged as the optimal model achieving 
the accuracy, F1-score, and AUC values of 0.821, 0.596, and 0.864, respectively. 
The net benefit of the model surpassed other models at 16%-22% threshold 
probabilities based on decision curve analysis. According to the importance of 
features in the RF model, red blood cell distribution width, blood urea 
nitrogen, Simplified Acute Physiology Score II, Sequential Organ Failure 
Assessment, and white blood cell count were highlighted as the five most 
influential variables.
CONCLUSIONS: We developed ML models to predict 28-day all-cause mortality in HF 
patients associated with CDI in the ICU, which are more effective than the 
conventional LR model. The RF model has the best performance among all the ML 
models employed. It may be useful to help clinicians identify high-risk HF 
patients with CDI.

INTRODUCTION: Recent studies have highlighted adverse outcomes of fluid overload 
in critically ill patients. Therefore, its early recognition is essential for 
the management of these patients.
OBJECTIVES: Our aim was to propose a deep learning (DL) model using data from 
noninvasive chest X‑ray (CXR) imaging associated with the fluid overload status.
PATIENTS AND METHODS: We collected data from the Medical Information Mart for 
Intensive Care IV (MIMIC‑IV, v. 1.0) and MIMIC Chest X‑Ray (v. 2.0.0) databases 
for modeling, and from our hospital database for testing. The extravascular lung 
water index (ELWI) greater than 10 ml/kg and the global end-diastolic volume 
index (GEDI) greater than 700 ml/m2 were used as threshold values for the fluid 
overload status. A DL model with a transfer learning strategy was proposed to 
predict the fluid overload status based on CXR images, and compared with 
clinical and semantic label models. Additionally, a visualization technique was 
adopted to determine the important areas of features in the input images.
RESULTS: The DL model showed a relatively strong performance for predicting the 
ELWI (area under the curve [AUC] = 0.896; 95% CI, 0.819-0.972 and AUC = 0.718; 
95% CI, 0.594-0.822, respectively) and the GEDI status (AUC = 0.814; 95% CI, 
0.699-0.930 and AUC = 0.649; 95% CI, 0.510-0.787, respectively) in both the 
primary and the test cohort. The performance was better than that of the 
clinical and semantic label models.
CONCLUSIONS: As CXR is routinely used in the intensive care unit, a simple, 
fast, low‑cost, and noninvasive DL model based on this modality can be regarded 
as an effective supplementary tool for identifying fluid overload, and should be 
widely adopted in the clinical setting, especially when invasive hemodynamic 
monitoring is not available.

BACKGROUND: Multi-center electronic health records (EHR) can support quality 
improvement initiatives and comparative effectiveness research in stroke care. 
However, limitations of EHR-based research include challenges in abstracting key 
clinical variables from non-structured data at scale. This is further compounded 
by missing data. Here we develop a natural language processing (NLP) model that 
automatically reads EHR notes to determine the NIH stroke scale (NIHSS) score of 
patients with acute stroke.
METHODS: The study included notes from acute stroke patients (>= 18 years) 
admitted to the Massachusetts General Hospital (MGH) (2015-2022). The MGH data 
were divided into training (70%) and hold-out test (30%) sets. A two-stage model 
was developed to predict the admission NIHSS. A linear model with the least 
absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) was trained within the 
training set. For notes in the test set where the NIHSS was documented, the 
scores were extracted using regular expressions (stage 1), for notes where NIHSS 
was not documented, LASSO was used for prediction (stage 2). The reference 
standard for NIHSS was obtained from Get With The Guidelines Stroke Registry. 
The two-stage model was tested on the hold-out test set and validated in the 
MIMIC-III dataset (Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care-MIMIC III 
2001-2012) v1.4, using root mean squared error (RMSE) and Spearman correlation 
(SC).
RESULTS: We included 4,163 patients (MGH = 3,876; MIMIC = 287); average age of 
69 [SD 15] years; 53% male, and 72% white. 90% patients had ischemic stroke and 
10% hemorrhagic stroke. The two-stage model achieved a RMSE [95% CI] of 3.13 
[2.86-3.41] (SC = 0.90 [0.88-0. 91]) in the MGH hold-out test set and 2.01 
[1.58-2.38] (SC = 0.96 [0.94-0.97]) in the MIMIC validation set.
CONCLUSIONS: The automatic NLP-based model can enable large-scale stroke 
severity phenotyping from EHR and therefore support real-world quality 
improvement and comparative effectiveness studies in stroke.

Intensive care units (ICUs) are responsible for generating a wealth of useful 
data in the form of electronic health records. We aimed to build a mortality 
prediction model on a Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care (MIMIC-III) 
database and to assess whether the use of deep learning techniques like long 
short-term memory (LSTM) can effectively utilize the temporal relations among 
clinical variables. The models were built on clinical variable dynamics of the 
first 48 h of ICU admission of 12,550 records from the MIMIC-III database. A 
total of 36 variables including 33 time series variables and three static 
variables were used for the prediction. We present the application of LSTM and 
LSTM attention (LSTM-AT) model for mortality prediction with such a large number 
of clinical variables dataset. For training and validation purpose, we have used 
International Classification of Diseases, 9th edition (ICD-9) codes for 
extracting the patients with cardiovascular disease, and infections and 
parasitic disease, respectively. The effectiveness of the LSTM model is achieved 
over non-recurrent baseline models like naïve Bayes, logistic regression (LR), 
support vector machine and multilayer perceptron (MLP) by generating state of 
the art results (area under the curve [AUC], 0.852). Next, by providing 
attention at each time stamp, we developed a model, LSTM-AT, which exhibits even 
better performance (AUC, 0.876).

OBJECTIVE: Social determinants of health (SDOH) are nonmedical factors that can 
influence health outcomes. This paper seeks to extract SDOH from clinical texts 
in the context of the National NLP Clinical Challenges (n2c2) 2022 Track 2 Task.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: Annotated and unannotated data from the Medical 
Information Mart for Intensive Care III (MIMIC-III) corpus, the Social History 
Annotation Corpus, and an in-house corpus were used to develop 2 deep learning 
models that used classification and sequence-to-sequence (seq2seq) approaches.
RESULTS: The seq2seq approach had the highest overall F1 scores in the 
challenge's 3 subtasks: 0.901 on the extraction subtask, 0.774 on the 
generalizability subtask, and 0.889 on the learning transfer subtask.
DISCUSSION: Both approaches rely on SDOH event representations that were 
designed to be compatible with transformer-based pretrained models, with the 
seq2seq representation supporting an arbitrary number of overlapping and 
sentence-spanning events. Models with adequate performance could be produced 
quickly, and the remaining mismatch between representation and task requirements 
was then addressed in postprocessing. The classification approach used rules to 
generate entity relationships from its sequence of token labels, while the 
seq2seq approach used constrained decoding and a constraint solver to recover 
entity text spans from its sequence of potentially ambiguous tokens.
CONCLUSION: We proposed 2 different approaches to extract SDOH from clinical 
texts with high accuracy. However, accuracy suffers on text from new healthcare 
institutions not present in the training data, and thus generalization remains 
an important topic for future study.

BACKGROUND: Stroke is one of the leading causes of death and disability 
worldwide. The National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale (NIHSS) scores in 
electronic health records (EHRs), which quantitatively describe patients' 
neurological deficits in evidence-based treatment, are crucial in stroke-related 
clinical investigations. However, the free-text format and lack of 
standardization inhibit their effective use. Automatically extracting the scale 
scores from the clinical free text so that its potential value in real-world 
studies is realized has become an important goal.
OBJECTIVE: This study aims to develop an automated method to extract scale 
scores from the free text of EHRs.
METHODS: We propose a two-step pipeline method to identify NIHSS items and 
numerical scores and validate its feasibility using a freely accessible critical 
care database: MIMIC-III (Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care III). 
First, we utilize MIMIC-III to create an annotated corpus. Then, we investigate 
possible machine learning methods for two subtasks, NIHSS item and score 
recognition and item-score relation extraction. In the evaluation, we conduct 
both task-specific and end-to-end evaluations and compare our method with the 
rule-based method using precision, recall and F1 scores as evaluation metrics.
RESULTS: We use all available discharge summaries of stroke cases in MIMIC-III. 
The annotated NIHSS corpus contains 312 cases, 2929 scale items, 2774 scores and 
2733 relations. The results show that the best F1-score of our method was 
0.9006, which was attained by combining BERT-BiLSTM-CRF and Random Forest, and 
it outperformed the rule-based method (F1-score = 0.8098). In the end-to-end 
task, our method could successfully recognize the item "1b level of 
consciousness questions", the score "1" and their relation "('1b level of 
consciousness questions', '1', 'has value')" from the sentence "1b level of 
consciousness questions: said name = 1", while the rule-based method could not.
CONCLUSIONS: The two-step pipeline method we propose is an effective approach to 
identify NIHSS items, scores and their relations. With its help, clinical 
investigators can easily retrieve and access structured scale data, thereby 
supporting stroke-related real-world studies.

BACKGROUND: Neonatal sepsis is associated with most cases of mortalities and 
morbidities in the neonatal intensive care unit (NICU). Many studies have 
developed prediction models for the early diagnosis of bloodstream infections in 
newborns, but there are limitations to data collection and management because 
these models are based on high-resolution waveform data.
OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to examine the feasibility of a prediction 
model by using noninvasive vital sign data and machine learning technology.
METHODS: We used electronic medical record data in intensive care units 
published in the Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care III clinical 
database. The late-onset neonatal sepsis (LONS) prediction algorithm using our 
proposed forward feature selection technique was based on NICU inpatient data 
and was designed to detect clinical sepsis 48 hours before occurrence. The 
performance of this prediction model was evaluated using various feature 
selection algorithms and machine learning models.
RESULTS: The performance of the LONS prediction model was found to be comparable 
to that of the prediction models that use invasive data such as high-resolution 
vital sign data, blood gas estimations, blood cell counts, and pH levels. The 
area under the receiver operating characteristic curve of the 48-hour prediction 
model was 0.861 and that of the onset detection model was 0.868. The main 
features that could be vital candidate markers for clinical neonatal sepsis were 
blood pressure, oxygen saturation, and body temperature. Feature generation 
using kurtosis and skewness of the features showed the highest performance.
CONCLUSIONS: The findings of our study confirmed that the LONS prediction model 
based on machine learning can be developed using vital sign data that are 
regularly measured in clinical settings. Future studies should conduct external 
validation by using different types of data sets and actual clinical 
verification of the developed model.

BACKGROUND: Advances in artificial intelligence (AI) have realized the potential 
of revolutionizing healthcare, such as predicting disease progression via 
longitudinal inspection of Electronic Health Records (EHRs) and lab tests from 
patients admitted to Intensive Care Units (ICU). Although substantial literature 
exists addressing broad subjects, including the prediction of mortality, 
length-of-stay, and readmission, studies focusing on forecasting Acute Kidney 
Injury (AKI), specifically dialysis anticipation like Continuous Renal 
Replacement Therapy (CRRT) are scarce. The technicality of how to implement AI 
remains elusive.
OBJECTIVE: This study aims to elucidate the important factors and methods that 
are required to develop effective predictive models of AKI and CRRT for patients 
admitted to ICU, using EHRs in the Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care 
(MIMIC) database.
METHODS: We conducted a comprehensive comparative analysis of established 
predictive models, considering both time-series measurements and clinical notes 
from MIMIC-IV databases. Subsequently, we proposed a novel multi-modal model 
which integrates embeddings of top-performing unimodal models, including Long 
Short-Term Memory (LSTM) and BioMedBERT, and leverages both unstructured 
clinical notes and structured time series measurements derived from EHRs to 
enable the early prediction of AKI and CRRT.
RESULTS: Our multimodal model achieved a lead time of at least 12 hours ahead of 
clinical manifestation, with an Area Under the Receiver Operating Characteristic 
Curve (AUROC) of 0.888 for AKI and 0.997 for CRRT, as well as an Area Under the 
Precision Recall Curve (AUPRC) of 0.727 for AKI and 0.840 for CRRT, 
respectively, which significantly outperformed the baseline models. 
Additionally, we performed a SHapley Additive exPlanation (SHAP) analysis using 
the expected gradients algorithm, which highlighted important, previously 
underappreciated predictive features for AKI and CRRT.
CONCLUSION: Our study revealed the importance and the technicality of applying 
longitudinal, multimodal modeling to improve early prediction of AKI and CRRT, 
offering insights for timely interventions. The performance and interpretability 
of our model indicate its potential for further assessment towards clinical 
applications, to ultimately optimize AKI management and enhance patient 
outcomes.

BACKGROUND: High sepsis mortality rates pose a serious global health problem. 
Machine learning is a promising technique with the potential to improve 
mortality prediction for this disease in an accurate and timely manner.
OBJECTIVES: This study aimed to develop a model capable of rapidly and 
accurately predicting sepsis mortality using data that can be quickly obtained 
in an ambulance, with a focus on practical application during ambulance 
transport.
MATERIAL AND METHODS: Data from the Medical Information Mart for Intensive 
Care-IV (MIMIC-IV) dataset were used to compare the performance of 11 machine 
learning algorithms against the widely utilized quick Sequential Organ Failure 
Assessment (qSOFA) score. A dynamic updating model was implemented. Performance 
was evaluated using area under the curve (AUC) and precision-recall area under 
the curve (PRAUC) scores, and feature importance was assessed with SHapley 
Additive exPlanations (SHAP) values.
RESULTS: The light gradient boosting machine (LightGBM) model achieved the 
highest AUC (0.79) and PRAUC (0.44) scores, outperforming the qSOFA score (AUC = 
0.76, PRAUC = 0.40). The LightGBM also achieved the highest PRAUC (0.44), 
followed by Optuna_LightGBM (0.43) and random forest (0.42). The dynamically 
updated and tuned model further improved performance metrics (AUC = 0.79, PRAUC 
= 0.44) compared to the base model (AUC = 0.76, PRAUC = 0.39). Feature 
importance analysis offers clinicians insights for prioritizing patient 
assessments and interventions.
CONCLUSIONS: The LightGBM-based model demonstrated superior performance in 
predicting sepsis-related mortality in an ambulance setting. This study 
underscores the practical applicability of machine learning models, addressing 
the limitations of previous research, and highlights the importance of real-time 
updates and hyperparameter tuning in optimizing model performance.

BACKGROUND: The aim of this study was to use five machine learning approaches 
and logistic regression to design and validate the acute kidney injury (AKI) 
prediction model for critically ill individuals with cardiogenic shock (CS).
METHODS: All patients who diagnosed with CS from the MIMIC-IV database, the eICU 
database, and Zhongnan hospital of Wuhan university were included in this study. 
Clinical information, including demographics, comorbidities, vital signs, 
critical illness scores and laboratory tests was retrospectively collected. Five 
machine learning algorithms (LightGBM, decision tree, XGBoost, random forest, 
and ensemble model) and one conventional logistic regression were applied for 
the prediction of AKI in critically ill individuals with CS. ROC curves were 
generated via python software to assess the overall performance of machine 
learning algorithms and the SHAP analysis was adopted to reveal the impact of 
prediction for each feature.
RESULTS: The ensemble model exhibited the best predictive ability (AUC:0.91, 95% 
CI, 0.88-0.94), followed by random forest (AUC:0.90, 95% CI, 0.86-0.94) and 
XGBoost (AUC:0.89, 95% CI, 0.84-0.92). While the logistic regression model 
obtained the worst predictive performance (AUC:0.62, 95% CI, 0.56-0.68). When 
validated the prediction models with eICU database, the ensemble model exhibited 
the best predictive ability (AUC:0.92, 95% CI, 0.89-0.96), while the logistic 
model obtained the worst predictive performance (AUC:0.61, 95% CI, 0.56-0.67). 
Finally, we verified the prediction models using the data from our hospital and 
ensemble model still exhibited the best predictive ability (AUC:0.74, 95% CI, 
0.62-0.86), while the decision tree model obtained the worst predictive 
performance (AUC:0.52, 95% CI 0.35-0.70).
CONCLUSION: Machine learning algorithms could be utilized for the AKI prediction 
among critically ill CS patients, and exhibit superior predictive performance 
compared to the conventional logistic regression analysis.

BACKGROUND: Elderly patients are more likely to suffer from severe ischemic 
stroke (IS) and have worse outcomes, including death and disability. We aimed to 
develop and validate predictive models using novel machine learning algorithms 
for the 3-month mortality in elderly patients with IS admitted to the intensive 
care unit (ICU).
METHODS: We conducted a retrospective cohort study. Data were extracted from 
Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care (MIMIC)-IV and International Stroke 
Perfusion Imaging Registry (INSPIRE) database. Ten machine learning algorithms 
including Categorical Boosting (CatBoost), Random Forest (RF), Support Vector 
Machine (SVM), Neural Network (NN), Gradient Boosting Machine (GBM), K-Nearest 
Neighbors (KNNs), Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP), Naive Bayes (NB), eXtreme 
Gradient Boosting (XGBoost) and Logistic Regression (LR) were used to build the 
models. Performance was measured using area under the curve (AUC) and accuracy. 
Finally, interpretable machine learning (IML) models presenting as Shapley 
additive explanation (SHAP) values were applied for mortality risk prediction.
RESULTS: A total of 1826 elderly patients with IS admitted to the ICU were 
included in the analysis, of whom 624 (34.2%) died, and endovascular treatment 
was performed in 244 patients. After feature selection, a total of eight 
variables, including minimum Glasgow Coma Scale values, albumin, lactate 
dehydrogenase, age, alkaline phosphatase, body mass index, platelets, and types 
of surgery, were finally used for model construction. The AUCs of the CatBoost 
model were 0.737 in the testing set and 0.709 in the external validation set. 
The Brier scores in the training set and testing set were 0.12 and 0.21, 
respectively. The IML of the CatBoost model was performed based on the SHAP 
value and the Local Interpretable Model-Agnostic Explanations method.
CONCLUSION: The CatBoost model had the best predictive performance for 
predicting mortality in elderly patients with IS admitted to the ICU. The IML 
model would further aid in clinical decision-making and timely healthcare 
services by the early identification of high-risk patients.

OBJECTIVE: This study aims to evaluate the association between the white blood 
cell-to-platelet ratio (WPR) and 28-day all-cause mortality among patients 
experiencing cardiac arrest.
METHODS: Utilizing data from 748 cardiac arrest patients in the Medical 
Information Mart for Intensive Care-IV (MIMIC-IV) 2.2 database, machine learning 
algorithms, including the Boruta feature selection method, random forest 
modeling, and SHAP value analysis, were applied to identify significant 
prognostic biomarkers. Key patient characteristics, encompassing demographic 
data, comorbidities, hematological and biochemical indices, and vital signs, 
were extracted using PostgreSQL Administration Tool (pgAdmin) software. The Cox 
proportional hazards model assessed the impact of WPR on mortality outcomes, 
while Kaplan-Meier survival curves and restricted cubic spline (RCS) analysis 
further validated the findings. Subgroup analyses stratified the prognostic 
value of WPR by demographic and clinical factors.
RESULTS: WPR demonstrated the highest prognostic significance among the 
variables studied, showing a strong association with 28-day all-cause mortality. 
In the unadjusted Model 1, hazard ratios (HRs) for WPR quartiles ranged from 
1.88 (95% CI: 1.22-2.90) in Q2 to 3.02 (95% CI: 2.04-4.47) in Q4 (Ptrend <0.05). 
Adjusted models (Models 2-4) confirmed the robustness of these associations, 
even after accounting for demographic and clinical covariates. Kaplan-Meier and 
RCS analyses revealed a significant U-shaped relationship between WPR and 
mortality risk. Subgroup analyses indicated that elevated WPR was particularly 
associated with increased mortality in males, elderly patients, married 
individuals, and those with chronic pulmonary disease.
CONCLUSION: WPR serves as an independent and reliable prognostic biomarker for 
28-day mortality in cardiac arrest patients. Its integration into clinical 
decision-making may enhance the early identification of high-risk patients and 
guide tailored therapeutic interventions.

Characterizing Risk of In-Hospital Mortality Following Subarachnoid Hemorrhage 
Using Machine Learning: A Retrospective Study.

University, Chongqing, China.

BACKGROUND: Subarachnoid hemorrhage has a high rate of disability and mortality, 
and the ability to use existing disease severity scores to estimate the risk of 
adverse outcomes is limited. Collect relevant information of patients during 
hospitalization to develop more accurate risk prediction models, using logistic 
regression (LR) and machine learning (ML) technologies, combined with 
biochemical information.
METHODS: Patient-level data were extracted from MIMIC-IV data. The primary 
outcome was in-hospital mortality. The models were trained and tested on a data 
set (ratio 70:30) including age and key past medical history. The recursive 
feature elimination (RFE) algorithm was used to screen the characteristic 
variables; then, the ML algorithm was used to analyze and establish the 
prediction model, and the validation set was used to further verify the 
effectiveness of the model.
RESULT: Of the 1,787 patients included in the mimic database, a total of 379 
died during hospitalization. Recursive feature abstraction (RFE) selected 20 
variables. After simplification, we determined 10 features, including the 
Glasgow coma score (GCS), glucose, sodium, chloride, SPO2, bicarbonate, 
temperature, white blood cell (WBC), heparin use, and sepsis-related organ 
failure assessment (SOFA) score. The validation set and Delong test showed that 
the simplified RF model has a high AUC of 0.949, which is not significantly 
different from the best model. Furthermore, in the DCA curve, the simplified GBM 
model has relatively higher net benefits. In the subgroup analysis of 
non-traumatic subarachnoid hemorrhage, the simplified GBM model has a high AUC 
of 0.955 and relatively higher net benefits.
CONCLUSIONS: ML approaches significantly enhance predictive discrimination for 
mortality following subarachnoid hemorrhage compared to existing illness 
severity scores and LR. The discriminative ability of these ML models requires 
validation in external cohorts to establish generalizability.

OBJECTIVE: To detect and classify features of stigmatizing and biased language 
in intensive care electronic health records (EHRs) using natural language 
processing techniques.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: We first created a lexicon and regular expression lists 
from literature-driven stem words for linguistic features of stigmatizing 
patient labels, doubt markers, and scare quotes within EHRs. The lexicon was 
further extended using Word2Vec and GPT 3.5, and refined through human 
evaluation. These lexicons were used to search for matches across 18 million 
sentences from the de-identified Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care-III 
(MIMIC-III) dataset. For each linguistic bias feature, 1000 sentence matches 
were sampled, labeled by expert clinical and public health annotators, and used 
to supervised learning classifiers.
RESULTS: Lexicon development from expanded literature stem-word lists resulted 
in a doubt marker lexicon containing 58 expressions, and a stigmatizing labels 
lexicon containing 127 expressions. Classifiers for doubt markers and 
stigmatizing labels had the highest performance, with macro F1-scores of 0.84 
and 0.79, positive-label recall and precision values ranging from 0.71 to 0.86, 
and accuracies aligning closely with human annotator agreement (0.87).
DISCUSSION: This study demonstrated the feasibility of supervised classifiers in 
automatically identifying stigmatizing labels and doubt markers in medical text 
and identified trends in stigmatizing language use in an EHR setting. Additional 
labeled data may help improve lower scare quote model performance.
CONCLUSIONS: Classifiers developed in this study showed high model performance 
and can be applied to identify patterns and target interventions to reduce 
stigmatizing labels and doubt markers in healthcare systems.

BACKGROUND AND AIM: Acute pancreatitis (AP) is potentially fatal. Therefore, 
early identification of patients at a high mortality risk and timely 
intervention are essential. This study aimed to establish an explainable 
machine-learning model for predicting in-hospital mortality of intensive care 
unit (ICU) patients with AP.
METHODS: Data on patients with AP, including demographics, vital signs, 
laboratory tests, comorbidities, treatment, complication, and severity scores, 
were extracted from the Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care IV 
(MIMIC-IV) and the eICU collaborative research database (eICU-CRD). Based on the 
data from MIMIC-IV, we used the least absolute shrinkage and selection operator 
algorithm to select variables and then established 9 machine-learning models and 
screened the optimal model. Data from the eICU-CRD were used for external 
validation. The area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC), 
sensitivity, specificity, accuracy, decision curve, and calibration plots were 
used to assess the models' efficacy. Shapley's additive explanation values were 
used to explain the model.
RESULTS: Gaussian naive Bayes (GNB) model had the best performance on the data 
from MIMIC-IV, with an AUC, accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity of 0.840, 
0.787, 0.839, and 0.792, respectively. The GNB model also performed well on the 
data from the eICU-CRD, with an AUC, accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity of 
0.862, 0.833, 0.848, and 0.763, respectively. According to Shapley's additive 
explanation values, the top 4 predictive factors were maximum red cell 
distribution width, minimum saturation of blood oxygen, maximum blood urea 
nitrogen, and the Sequential Organ Failure Assessment score.
CONCLUSION: The GNB model demonstrated excellent performance and 
generalizability in predicting mortality in ICU patients with AP. Therefore, it 
can identify patients at a high mortality risk.

OBJECTIVE: Multitask learning (MTL) using electronic health records allows 
concurrent prediction of multiple endpoints. MTL has shown promise in improving 
model performance and training efficiency; however, it often suffers from 
negative transfer - impaired learning if tasks are not appropriately selected. 
We introduce a sequential subnetwork routing (SeqSNR) architecture that uses 
soft parameter sharing to find related tasks and encourage cross-learning 
between them.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: Using the MIMIC-III (Medical Information Mart for 
Intensive Care-III) dataset, we train deep neural network models to predict the 
onset of 6 endpoints including specific organ dysfunctions and general clinical 
outcomes: acute kidney injury, continuous renal replacement therapy, mechanical 
ventilation, vasoactive medications, mortality, and length of stay. We compare 
single-task (ST) models with naive multitask and SeqSNR in terms of 
discriminative performance and label efficiency.
RESULTS: SeqSNR showed a modest yet statistically significant performance boost 
across 4 of 6 tasks compared with ST and naive multitasking. When the size of 
the training dataset was reduced for a given task (label efficiency), SeqSNR 
outperformed ST for all cases showing an average area under the precision-recall 
curve boost of 2.1%, 2.9%, and 2.1% for tasks using 1%, 5%, and 10% of labels, 
respectively.
CONCLUSIONS: The SeqSNR architecture shows superior label efficiency compared 
with ST and naive multitasking, suggesting utility in scenarios in which 
endpoint labels are difficult to ascertain.

OBJECTIVE: The primary objective is to develop an automated method for detecting 
patients that are ready for discharge from intensive care.
DESIGN: We used two datasets of routinely collected patient data to test and 
improve on a set of previously proposed discharge criteria.
SETTING: Bristol Royal Infirmary general intensive care unit (GICU).
PATIENTS: Two cohorts derived from historical datasets: 1870 intensive care 
patients from GICU in Bristol, and 7592 from Medical Information Mart for 
Intensive Care (MIMIC)-III.
RESULTS: In both cohorts few successfully discharged patients met all of the 
discharge criteria. Both a random forest and a logistic classifier, trained 
using multiple-source cross-validation, demonstrated improved performance over 
the original criteria and generalised well between the cohorts. The classifiers 
showed good agreement on which features were most predictive of 
readiness-for-discharge, and these were generally consistent with clinical 
experience. By weighting the discharge criteria according to feature importance 
from the logistic model we showed improved performance over the original 
criteria, while retaining good interpretability.
CONCLUSIONS: Our findings indicate the feasibility of the proposed approach to 
ready-for-discharge classification, which could complement other risk models of 
specific adverse outcomes in a future decision support system. Avenues for 
improvement to produce a clinically useful tool are identified.

BACKGROUND: This study aimed to identify the risk factors for in-hospital acute 
kidney injury (AKI) in patients with acute aortic dissection (AAD) and to 
establish a machine learning model for predicting in-hospital AKI.
METHODS: We extracted data on patients with AAD from the Medical Information 
Mart for Intensive Care (MIMIC)-IV database and developed seven machine learning 
models: support vector machine (SVM), gradient boosting machine (GBM), neural 
network (NNET), eXtreme gradient boosting (XGBoost), K-nearest neighbors (KNN), 
light gradient boosting machine (LightGBM), and categorical boosting (CatBoost). 
Model performance was assessed using the area under the receiver operating 
characteristic curve (AUC), and the optimal model was interpreted using Shapley 
Additive explanations (SHAP) visualization analysis.
RESULTS: A total of 325 patients with AAD were identified from the MIMIC-IV 
database, of which 84 patients (25.85%) developed in-hospital AKI. This study 
collected 42 features, with nine selected for model building. A total of 70% of 
the patients were randomly allocated to the training set, while the remaining 
30% were allocated to the test set. Machine learning models were built on the 
training set and validated using the test set. In addition, we collected AAD 
patient data from the MIMIC-III database for external validation. Among the 
seven machine learning models, the CatBoost model performed the best, with an 
AUC of 0.876 in the training set and 0.723 in the test set. CatBoost also 
performed strongly during the validation, achieving an AUC of 0.712. SHAP 
visualization analysis identified the most important risk factors for 
in-hospital AKI in AAD patients as maximum blood urea nitrogen (BUN), body mass 
index (BMI), urine output, maximum glucose (GLU), minimum BUN, minimum 
creatinine, maximum creatinine, weight and acute physiology score III (APSIII).
CONCLUSIONS: The CatBoost model, constructed using risk factors including 
maximum and minimum BUN levels, BMI, urine output, and maximum GLU, effectively 
predicts the risk of in-hospital AKI in AAD patients and shows compelling 
results in further validations.

A Comprehensive and Improved Definition for Hospital-Acquired Pressure Injury 
Classification Based on Electronic Health Records: Comparative Study.

BACKGROUND: Patients develop pressure injuries (PIs) in the hospital owing to 
low mobility, exposure to localized pressure, circulatory conditions, and other 
predisposing factors. Over 2.5 million Americans develop PIs annually. The 
Center for Medicare and Medicaid considers hospital-acquired PIs (HAPIs) as the 
most frequent preventable event, and they are the second most common claim in 
lawsuits. With the growing use of electronic health records (EHRs) in hospitals, 
an opportunity exists to build machine learning models to identify and predict 
HAPI rather than relying on occasional manual assessments by human experts. 
However, accurate computational models rely on high-quality HAPI data labels. 
Unfortunately, the different data sources within EHRs can provide conflicting 
information on HAPI occurrence in the same patient. Furthermore, the existing 
definitions of HAPI disagree with each other, even within the same patient 
population. The inconsistent criteria make it impossible to benchmark machine 
learning methods to predict HAPI.
OBJECTIVE: The objective of this project was threefold. We aimed to identify 
discrepancies in HAPI sources within EHRs, to develop a comprehensive definition 
for HAPI classification using data from all EHR sources, and to illustrate the 
importance of an improved HAPI definition.
METHODS: We assessed the congruence among HAPI occurrences documented in 
clinical notes, diagnosis codes, procedure codes, and chart events from the 
Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care III database. We analyzed the 
criteria used for the 3 existing HAPI definitions and their adherence to the 
regulatory guidelines. We proposed the Emory HAPI (EHAPI), which is an improved 
and more comprehensive HAPI definition. We then evaluated the importance of the 
labels in training a HAPI classification model using tree-based and sequential 
neural network classifiers.
RESULTS: We illustrate the complexity of defining HAPI, with <13% of hospital 
stays having at least 3 PI indications documented across 4 data sources. 
Although chart events were the most common indicator, it was the only PI 
documentation for >49% of the stays. We demonstrate a lack of congruence across 
existing HAPI definitions and EHAPI, with only 219 stays having a consensus 
positive label. Our analysis highlights the importance of our improved HAPI 
definition, with classifiers trained using our labels outperforming others on a 
small manually labeled set from nurse annotators and a consensus set in which 
all definitions agreed on the label.
CONCLUSIONS: Standardized HAPI definitions are important for accurately 
assessing HAPI nursing quality metric and determining HAPI incidence for 
preventive measures. We demonstrate the complexity of defining an occurrence of 
HAPI, given the conflicting and incomplete EHR data. Our EHAPI definition has 
favorable properties, making it a suitable candidate for HAPI classification 
tasks.

Background Natural language processing (NLP) is commonly used to annotate 
radiology datasets for training deep learning (DL) models. However, the accuracy 
and potential biases of these NLP methods have not been thoroughly investigated, 
particularly across different demographic groups. Purpose To evaluate the 
accuracy and demographic bias of four NLP radiology report labeling tools on two 
chest radiograph datasets. Materials and Methods This retrospective study, 
performed between April 2022 and April 2024, evaluated chest radiograph report 
labeling using four NLP tools (CheXpert [rule-based], RadReportAnnotator [RRA; 
DL-based], OpenAI's GPT-4 [DL-based], cTAKES [hybrid]) on a subset of the 
Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care (MIMIC) chest radiograph dataset 
balanced for representation of age, sex, and race and ethnicity (n = 692) and 
the entire Indiana University (IU) chest radiograph dataset (n = 3665). Three 
board-certified radiologists annotated the chest radiograph reports for 14 
thoracic disease labels. NLP tool performance was evaluated using several 
metrics, including accuracy and error rate. Bias was evaluated by comparing 
performance between demographic subgroups using the Pearson χ2 test. Results The 
IU dataset included 3665 patients (mean age, 49.7 years ± 17 [SD]; 1963 female), 
while the MIMIC dataset included 692 patients (mean age, 54.1 years ± 23.1; 357 
female). All four NLP tools demonstrated high accuracy across findings in the IU 
and MIMIC datasets, as follows: CheXpert (92.6% [47 516 of 51 310], 90.2% [8742 
of 9688]), RRA (82.9% [19 746 of 23 829], 92.2% [2870 of 3114]), GPT-4 (94.3% 
[45 586 of 48 342], 91.6% [6721 of 7336]), and cTAKES (84.7% [43 436 of 51 310], 
88.7% [8597 of 9688]). RRA and cTAKES had higher accuracy (P < .001) on the 
MIMIC dataset, while CheXpert and GPT-4 had higher accuracy on the IU dataset. 
Differences (P < .001) in error rates were observed across age groups for all 
NLP tools except RRA on the MIMIC dataset, with the highest error rates for 
CheXpert, RRA, and cTAKES in patients older than 80 years (mean, 15.8% ± 5.0) 
and the highest error rate for GPT-4 in patients 60-80 years of age (8.3%). 
Conclusion Although commonly used NLP tools for chest radiograph report 
annotation are accurate when evaluating reports in aggregate, demographic 
subanalyses showed significant bias, with poorer performance in older patients.

INTRODUCTION: About 42 million surgeries are performed annually in the USA. 
While the postoperative mortality is less than 2%, 12% of all patients in the 
high-risk surgery group account for 80% of postoperative deaths. New onset of 
haemodynamic instability is common in surgical patients and its delayed 
treatment leads to increased morbidity and mortality. The goal of this proposal 
is to develop, validate and test real-time intraoperative risk prediction tools 
based on clinical data and high-fidelity physiological waveforms to predict 
haemodynamic instability during surgery.
METHODS AND ANALYSIS: We will initiate our work using an existing annotated 
intraoperative database from the University of California Irvine, including 
clinical and high-fidelity waveform data. These data will be used for the 
training and development of the machine learning model (Carnegie Mellon 
University) that will then be tested on prospectively collected database 
(University of California Los Angeles). Simultaneously, we will use existing 
knowledge of haemodynamic instability patterns derived from our intensive care 
unit cohorts, medical information mart for intensive care II data, University of 
California Irvine data and animal studies to create smart alarms and graphical 
user interface for a clinical decision support. Using machine learning, we will 
extract a core dataset, which characterises the signatures of normal 
intraoperative variability, various haemodynamic instability aetiologies and 
variable responses to resuscitation. We will then employ clinician-driven 
iterative design to create a clinical decision support user interface, and 
evaluate its effect in simulated high-risk surgeries.
ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: We will publish the results in a peer-reviewed 
publication and will present this work at professional conferences for the 
anaesthesiology and computer science communities. Patient-level data will be 
made available within 6 months after publication of the primary manuscript. The 
study has been approved by University of California, Los Angeles Institutional 
review board. (IRB #19-0 00 354).

Dynamic treatment regimes (DTRs) formalize medical decision-making as a sequence 
of rules for different stages, mapping patient-level information to recommended 
treatments. In practice, estimating an optimal DTR using observational data from 
electronic medical record (EMR) databases can be complicated by nonignorable 
missing covariates resulting from informative monitoring of patients. Since 
complete case analysis can provide consistent estimation of outcome model 
parameters under the assumption of outcome-independent missingness, Q-learning 
is a natural approach to accommodating nonignorable missing covariates. However, 
the backward induction algorithm used in Q-learning can introduce challenges, as 
nonignorable missing covariates at later stages can result in nonignorable 
missing pseudo-outcomes at earlier stages, leading to suboptimal DTRs, even if 
the longitudinal outcome variables are fully observed. To address this unique 
missing data problem in DTR settings, we propose 2 weighted Q-learning 
approaches where inverse probability weights for missingness of the 
pseudo-outcomes are obtained through estimating equations with valid nonresponse 
instrumental variables or sensitivity analysis. The asymptotic properties of the 
weighted Q-learning estimators are derived, and the finite-sample performance of 
the proposed methods is evaluated and compared with alternative methods through 
extensive simulation studies. Using EMR data from the Medical Information Mart 
for Intensive Care database, we apply the proposed methods to investigate the 
optimal fluid strategy for sepsis patients in intensive care units.

This study aimed to preliminarily develop machine learning (ML) models capable 
of predicting the risk of device-associated infection and 30-day outcomes 
following invasive device procedures in intensive care unit (ICU) patients. The 
study utilized data from 8574 ICU patients who underwent invasive procedures, 
sourced from the Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care (MIMIC)-IV version 
2.2 database. Patients were allocated into training and validation datasets in a 
7:3 ratio. Seven ML models were employed for predicting device-associated 
infections, while five models were used for predicting 30-day survival outcomes. 
Model performance was primarily evaluated using the receiver operating 
characteristic (ROC) curve for infection prediction and the survival model's 
concordance index (C-index). Top-performing models progressively reduced the 
number of variables based on their importance, thereby optimizing practical 
utility. The inclusion of all variables demonstrated that extreme gradient 
boosting (XGBoost) and extra survival trees (EST) models yielded superior 
discriminatory performance. Notably, when restricted to the top 10 variables, 
both models maintained performance levels comparable to when all variables were 
included. In the validation cohort, the XGBoost model, with the top 10 
variables, achieved an area under the curve (AUC) of 0.810 (95% CI 0.808-0.812), 
an area under the precision-recall curve (AUPRC) of 0.226 (95% CI 0.222-0.230), 
and a Brier score (BS) of 0.053 (95% CI 0.053-0.054). The EST model, with the 
top 10 variables, reported a C-index of 0.756 (95% CI 0.754-0.757), a 
time-dependent AUC of 0.759 (95% CI 0.763-0.775), and an integrated Brier score 
(IBS) of 0.087 (95% CI 0.087-0.087). Both models are accessible via a web 
application. The internally evaluated XGBoost and EST models demonstrated 
exceptional predictive accuracy for device-associated infection risks and 30-day 
survival outcomes post-invasive procedures in ICU patients. Further validation 
is required to confirm the clinical utility of these two models in future 
studies.

Alzheimer's disease (AD) patients admitted to intensive care units (ICUs) 
exhibit varying survival outcomes due to the unique challenges in managing AD 
patients. Stratifying patient mortality risk and understanding the criticality 
of nursing care are important to improve the clinical outcomes of AD patients. 
This study aimed to leverage machine learning (ML) and electronic health records 
(EHRs) only consisting of demographics, disease history, and routine lab tests, 
with a focus on nursing care, to facilitate the optimization of nursing 
practices for AD patients. We utilized Medical Information Mart for Intensive 
Care III, an open-source EHR dataset, and AD patients were identified based on 
the International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision codes. From a 
cohort of 453 patients, a total of 60 features, encompassing demographics, 
laboratory tests, disease history, and number of nursing events, were extracted. 
ML models, including XGBoost, random forest, logistic regression, and 
multi-layer perceptron, were trained to predict the 30-day mortality risk. In 
addition, the influence of nursing care was analyzed in terms of feature 
importance using values calculated from both the inherent XGBoost module and the 
SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) library. XGBoost emerged as the lead model 
with a high accuracy of 0.730, area under the curve (AUC) of 0.750, sensitivity 
of 0.688, and specificity of 0.740. Feature importance analyses using inherent 
XGBoost module or SHAP both indicated the number of nursing care within 14 days 
post-admission as an important denominator for 30-day mortality risk. When 
nursing care events were excluded as a feature, stratifying patient mortality 
risk was also possible but the model's AUC of receiver operating characteristic 
curve was reduced to 0.68. Nursing care plays a pivotal role in the survival 
outcomes of AD patients in ICUs. ML models can be effectively employed to 
predict mortality risks and underscore the importance of specific features, 
including nursing care, in patient outcomes. Early identification of high-risk 
AD patients can aid in prioritizing intensive nursing care, potentially 
improving survival rates.

BACKGROUND: Sepsis-induced myocardial injury (SIMI) is a severe and common 
complication of sepsis; However, its definition remains unclear. Prognostic 
analyses may vary depending on the definition applied. Early prediction of SIMI 
is crucial for timely intervention, ultimately improving patient outcomes. This 
study aimed to evaluate the prognostic impact of SIMI and develop validated 
predictive models using advanced machine learning (ML) algorithms for 
identifying SIMI in critically ill sepsis patients.
METHODS: Data were sourced from the Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care 
IV (MIMIC-IV, v3.0) database. Patients meeting Sepsis-3.0 criteria were 
included, and SIMI was defined as troponin T (TNT) levels ≥0.1 ng/mL. Prognostic 
evaluation involved propensity score matching, inverse probability weighting, 
doubly robust analysis, logistic regression, and Cox regression. Patients were 
divided into training and testing datasets in a 7:3 ratio. Least absolute 
shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) regression was used for variable 
selection to simplify the model. Twelve hyperparameter-tuned ML models were 
developed and evaluated using visualized heatmaps. The best-performing model was 
deployed as a web-based application.
RESULTS: Among 2,435 patients analyzed, 571 (23.45%) developed SIMI following 
intensive care unit (ICU) admission. Boruta and LASSO identified 46 and 10 key 
variables, respectively, for prognostic and predictive modeling. Doubly robust 
analysis revealed significantly worse short- and intermediate-term outcomes for 
SIMI patients, including increased in-ICU mortality [odds ratio (OR) 1.39, 95% 
confidence interval (CI) 1.02-1.85, p < 0.05], 28-day mortality (OR 1.35, 95% CI 
1.02-1.79, p < 0.05), and 180-day mortality [hazard ratio (HR) 1.21, 95% CI 
1.01-1.44, p < 0.05]. However, one-year mortality showed no significant 
difference (HR 1.03, 95% CI 0.99-1.08, p = 0.169). The XGBoost model 
outperformed others, achieving an area under the receiver operating 
characteristic curve (AUROC) of 0.83 (95% CI 0.79-0.87). SHapley Additive 
exPlanations (SHAP) analysis highlighted the top five predictive features: 
creatine kinase-myocardial band (CKMB), creatinine, alanine aminotransferase 
(ALT), lactate, and blood urea nitrogen (BUN). A web-based application was 
subsequently developed for real-world use.
CONCLUSION: SIMI significantly worsens patient prognosis, while the XGBoost 
model demonstrated excellent predictive performance. The development of a 
web-based application provides clinicians with a practical tool for timely 
intervention, potentially improving outcomes for septic patients.

BACKGROUND: Medical concepts are inherently ambiguous and error-prone due to 
human fallibility, which makes it hard for them to be fully used by classical 
machine learning methods (eg, for tasks like early stage disease prediction).
OBJECTIVE: Our work was to create a new machine-friendly representation that 
resembles the semantics of medical concepts. We then developed a sequential 
predictive model for medical events based on this new representation.
METHODS: We developed novel contextual embedding techniques to combine different 
medical events (eg, diagnoses, prescriptions, and labs tests). Each medical 
event is converted into a numerical vector that resembles its "semantics," via 
which the similarity between medical events can be easily measured. We developed 
simple and effective predictive models based on these vectors to predict novel 
diagnoses.
RESULTS: We evaluated our sequential prediction model (and standard learning 
methods) in estimating the risk of potential diseases based on our contextual 
embedding representation. Our model achieved an area under the receiver 
operating characteristic (ROC) curve (AUC) of 0.79 on chronic systolic heart 
failure and an average AUC of 0.67 (over the 80 most common diagnoses) using the 
Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care III (MIMIC-III) dataset.
CONCLUSIONS: We propose a general early prognosis predictor for 80 different 
diagnoses. Our method computes numeric representation for each medical event to 
uncover the potential meaning of those events. Our results demonstrate the 
efficiency of the proposed method, which will benefit patients and physicians by 
offering more accurate diagnosis.

As delayed treatment of septic shock can lead to an irreversible health state, 
timely identification of septic shock holds immense value. While numerous 
approaches have been proposed to build early warning systems, these approaches 
primarily focus on predicting the future risk of septic shock, irrespective of 
its precise onset timing. Such early prediction systems without consideration of 
timeliness fall short in assisting clinicians in taking proactive measures. To 
address this limitation, we establish a timely warning system for septic shock 
with data-task engineering, a novel technique regarding the control of data 
samples and prediction targets. Leveraging machine learning techniques and the 
real-world electronic medical records from the MIMIC-IV (Medical Information 
Mart for Intensive Care) database, our system, TEW3S (Timely Early Warning 
System for Septic Shock), successfully predicted 94% of all shock events with 
one true alarm for every four false alarms and a maximum lead time of 8 hours. 
This approach emphasizes the often-overlooked importance of prediction 
timeliness and may provide a practical avenue to develop a timely warning system 
for acute deterioration in hospital settings, ultimately improving patient 
outcomes.

AIM: Acute kidney injury (AKI) is a common complication in critically ill 
cirrhotic patients with substantial mortality. Given AKI can be prevented 
through early detection, it is urgent to develop an easy model to identify 
high-risk patients.
METHODS: A total of 1149 decompensated cirrhotic (DC) patients from the eICU 
Collaborative Research Database were enrolled for model development and internal 
validation. The variables used for analysis mainly included laboratory tests. We 
first built an ensemble model (random forest, gradient boosting machine, 
K-nearest neighbor, and artificial neural network) named DC-AKI using machine 
learning methods. Based on the Akaike information criterion, we then constructed 
a risk score, which was externally validated in 789 DC patients from the Medical 
Information Mart for Intensive Care database.
RESULTS: AKI developed in 212 (26%) of 804 patients in the derivation cohort, 
and 355 (45%) of 789 patients in the external validation cohort. DC-AKI 
identified the eight variables most strongly associated with the outcome: serum 
creatinine, total bilirubin, magnesium, shock index, prothrombin time, mean 
corpuscular hemoglobin, lymphocytes, and arterial oxygen saturation. Based on 
the smallest Akaike information criterion, a six-variable model was eventually 
used to construct the scoring system (serum creatinine, total bilirubin, 
magnesium, shock index, lymphocytes, and arterial oxygen saturation). The 
scoring system showed good discrimination, with the area under the receiver 
operating characteristics curve of 0.805 and 0.772 in two validation cohorts.
CONCLUSIONS: The scoring system using routine laboratory data was able to 
predict the development of AKI in critically ill cirrhotic patients. The utility 
of this score in clinical care requires further research.

OBJECTIVES: The predictive intensive care unit (ICU) scoring system is crucial 
for predicting patient outcomes, particularly mortality. Traditional scoring 
systems rely mainly on structured clinical data from electronic health records, 
which can overlook important clinical information in narratives and images.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: In this work, we build a deep learning-based survival 
prediction model that utilizes multimodality data for ICU mortality prediction. 
Four sets of features are investigated: (1) physiological measurements of 
Simplified Acute Physiology Score (SAPS) II, (2) common thorax diseases 
predefined by radiologists, (3) bidirectional encoder representations from 
transformers-based text representations, and (4) chest X-ray image features. The 
model was evaluated using the Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care IV 
dataset.
RESULTS: Our model achieves an average C-index of 0.7829 (95% CI, 
0.7620-0.8038), surpassing the baseline using only SAPS-II features, which had a 
C-index of 0.7470 (95% CI: 0.7263-0.7676). Ablation studies further demonstrate 
the contributions of incorporating predefined labels (2.00% improvement), text 
features (2.44% improvement), and image features (2.82% improvement).
DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSION: The deep learning model demonstrated superior 
performance to traditional machine learning methods under the same feature 
fusion setting for ICU mortality prediction. This study highlights the potential 
of integrating multimodal data into deep learning models to enhance the accuracy 
of ICU mortality prediction.

OBJECTIVES: We tested the hypothesis that routine monitoring data could describe 
a detailed and distinct pathophysiologic phenotype of impending hypoglycemia in 
adult ICU patients.
DESIGN: Retrospective analysis leading to model development and validation.
SETTING: All ICU admissions wherein patients received insulin therapy during a 
4-year period at the University of Virginia Medical Center. Each ICU was 
equipped with continuous physiologic monitoring systems whose signals were 
archived in an electronic data warehouse along with the entire medical record.
PATIENTS: Eleven thousand eight hundred forty-seven ICU patient admissions.
INTERVENTIONS: The primary outcome was hypoglycemia, defined as any episode of 
blood glucose less than 70 mg/dL where 50% dextrose injection was administered 
within 1 hour. We used 61 physiologic markers (including vital signs, laboratory 
values, demographics, and continuous cardiorespiratory monitoring variables) to 
inform the model.
MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Our dataset consisted of 11,847 ICU patient 
admissions, 721 (6.1%) of which had one or more hypoglycemic episodes. 
Multivariable logistic regression analysis revealed a pathophysiologic signature 
of 41 independent variables that best characterized ICU hypoglycemia. The final 
model had a cross-validated area under the receiver operating characteristic 
curve of 0.83 (95% CI, 0.78-0.87) for prediction of impending ICU hypoglycemia. 
We externally validated the model in the Medical Information Mart for Intensive 
Care III critical care dataset, where it also demonstrated good performance with 
an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve of 0.79 (95% CI, 
0.77-0.81).
CONCLUSIONS: We used data from a large number of critically ill inpatients to 
develop and externally validate a predictive model of impending ICU 
hypoglycemia. Future steps include incorporating this model into a clinical 
decision support system and testing its effects in a multicenter randomized 
controlled clinical trial.

BACKGROUND: This study aims to investigate the clinical outcome between 
high-flow nasal cannula (HFNC) and non-invasive ventilation (NIV) therapy in 
mild to moderate hypoxemic patients on the first ICU day and to develop a 
predictive model of 48-h intubation.
METHODS: The study included adult patients from the MIMIC III and IV databases 
who first initiated HFNC or NIV therapy due to mild to moderate hypoxemia 
(100 < PaO2/FiO2 ≤ 300). The 48-h and 30-day intubation rates were compared 
using cross-sectional and survival analysis. Nine machine learning and six 
ensemble algorithms were deployed to construct the 48-h intubation predictive 
models, of which the optimal model was determined by its prediction accuracy. 
The top 10 risk and protective factors were identified using the Shapley 
interpretation algorithm.
RESULT: A total of 123,042 patients were screened, of which, 673 were from the 
MIMIC IV database for ventilation therapy comparison (HFNC n = 363, NIV n = 310) 
and 48-h intubation predictive model construction (training dataset n = 471, 
internal validation set n = 202) and 408 were from the MIMIC III database for 
external validation. The NIV group had a lower intubation rate (23.1% vs. 16.1%, 
p = 0.001), ICU 28-day mortality (18.5% vs. 11.6%, p = 0.014), and in-hospital 
mortality (19.6% vs. 11.9%, p = 0.007) compared to the HFNC group. Survival 
analysis showed that the total and 48-h intubation rates were not significantly 
different. The ensemble AdaBoost decision tree model (internal and external 
validation set AUROC 0.878, 0.726) had the best predictive accuracy performance. 
The model Shapley algorithm showed Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (SOFA), 
acute physiology scores (APSIII), the minimum and maximum lactate value as risk 
factors for early failure and age, the maximum PaCO2 and PH value, Glasgow Coma 
Scale (GCS), the minimum PaO2/FiO2 ratio, and PaO2 value as protective factors.
CONCLUSION: NIV was associated with lower intubation rate and ICU 28-day and 
in-hospital mortality. Further survival analysis reinforced that the effect of 
NIV on the intubation rate might partly be attributed to the other impact 
factors. The ensemble AdaBoost decision tree model may assist clinicians in 
making clinical decisions, and early organ function support to improve patients' 
SOFA, APSIII, GCS, PaCO2, PaO2, PH, PaO2/FiO2 ratio, and lactate values can 
reduce the early failure rate and improve patient prognosis.

PURPOSE: Acute Kidney Injury (AKI) is the sudden onset of kidney damage. This 
damage usually comes without warning and can lead to increased mortality and 
inpatient costs and is of particular significance to patients undergoing cancer 
treatment. In previous work, we developed a machine learning algorithm to 
predict AKI up to 30 days prior to the event, trained on cancer patient data. 
Here, we validate this model on non-cancer data.
METHODS/PATIENTS: Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care (MIMIC) is a 
large, freely available database containing de-identified data from patients who 
were admitted to the critical care units of the Beth Israel Deaconess Medical 
Center. Data from 28,498 MIMIC patients were used to validate our algorithm, 
non-availability of Total Protein measure being the largest removal criterion.
RESULTS AND CONCLUSIONS: Applying our algorithm to MIMIC data generated an AUROC 
of 0.821 (95% CI 0.820-0.821) per blood test. Our cancer derived algorithm 
compares positively with other AKI models derived and/or tested on MIMIC, with 
our model predicting AKI at the longest time frame of up to 30 days. This 
suggests that our model can achieve a good performance on patient cohorts very 
different to those from which it was derived, demonstrating the transferability 
and applicability for implementation in a clinical setting.

Improving the In-Hospital Mortality Prediction of Diabetes ICU Patients Using a 
Process Mining/Deep Learning Architecture.

Theis J, Galanter WL, Boyd AD, Darabi H.

Diabetes intensive care unit (ICU) patients are at increased risk of 
complications leading to in-hospital mortality. Assessing the likelihood of 
death is a challenging and time-consuming task due to a large number of 
influencing factors. Healthcare providers are interested in the detection of ICU 
patients at higher risk, such that risk factors can possibly be mitigated. While 
such severity scoring methods exist, they are commonly based on a snapshot of 
the health conditions of a patient during the ICU stay and do not specifically 
consider a patient's prior medical history. In this paper, a process mining/deep 
learning architecture is proposed to improve established severity scoring 
methods by incorporating the medical history of diabetes patients. First, health 
records of past hospital encounters are converted to event logs suitable for 
process mining. The event logs are then used to discover a process model that 
describes the past hospital encounters of patients. An adaptation of Decay 
Replay Mining is proposed to combine medical and demographic information with 
established severity scores to predict the in-hospital mortality of diabetes ICU 
patients. Significant performance improvements are demonstrated compared to 
established risk severity scoring methods and machine learning approaches using 
the Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care III dataset.

BACKGROUND: Although protective mechanical ventilation (MV) has been used in a 
variety of applications, lung injury may occur in both patients with and without 
acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). The purpose of this study is to use 
machine learning to identify clinical phenotypes for critically ill patients 
with MV in intensive care units (ICUs).
METHODS: A retrospective cohort study was conducted with 5013 patients who had 
undergone MV and treatment in the Department of Critical Care Medicine, Peking 
Union Medical College Hospital. Statistical and machine learning methods were 
used. All the data used in this study, including demographics, vital signs, 
circulation parameters and mechanical ventilator parameters, etc., were 
automatically extracted from the electronic health record (EHR) system. An 
external database, Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care III (MIMIC III), 
was used for validation.
RESULTS: Phenotypes were derived from a total of 4009 patients who underwent MV 
using a latent profile analysis of 22 variables. The associations between the 
phenotypes and disease severity and clinical outcomes were assessed. Another 
1004 patients in the database were enrolled for validation. Of the five derived 
phenotypes, phenotype I was the most common subgroup (n = 2174; 54.2%) and was 
mostly composed of the postoperative population. Phenotype II (n = 480; 12.0%) 
led to the most severe conditions. Phenotype III (n = 241; 6.01%) was associated 
with high positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) and low mean airway pressure. 
Phenotype IV (n = 368; 9.18%) was associated with high driving pressure, and 
younger patients comprised a large proportion of the phenotype V group (n = 746; 
18.6%). In addition, we found that the mortality rate of Phenotype IV was 
significantly higher than that of the other phenotypes. In this subgroup, the 
number of patients in the sequential organ failure assessment (SOFA) score 
segment (9,22] was 198, the number of deaths was 88, and the mortality rate was 
higher than 44%. However, the cumulative 28-day mortality of Phenotypes IV and 
II, which were 101 of 368 (27.4%) and 87 of 480 (18.1%) unique patients, 
respectively, was significantly higher than those of the other phenotypes. There 
were consistent phenotype distributions and differences in biomarker patterns by 
phenotype in the validation cohort, and external verification with MIMIC III 
further generated supportive results.
CONCLUSIONS: Five clinical phenotypes were correlated with different disease 
severities and clinical outcomes, which suggested that these phenotypes may help 
in understanding heterogeneity in MV treatment effects.

BACKGROUND: Previous models on prediction of shock mostly focused on septic 
shock and often required laboratory results in their models. The purpose of this 
study was to use deep learning approaches to predict vasopressor requirement for 
critically ill patients within 24 h of intensive care unit (ICU) admission using 
only vital signs.
METHODS: We used data from the Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care III 
database and the eICU Collaborative Research Database to develop a vasopressor 
prediction model. We performed systematic data preprocessing using matching of 
cohorts, oversampling, and imputation to control for bias, class imbalance, and 
missing data. Bidirectional long short-term memory (Bi-LSTM), a multivariate 
time series model, was used to predict the need for vasopressor therapy using 
serial physiological data collected 21 h prior to prediction time.
RESULTS: Using data from 10,941 critically ill patients from 209 ICUs, our model 
achieved an initial area under the curve of 0.96 (95% CI 0.96-0.96) to predict 
the need for vasopressor therapy in 2 h within the first day of ICU admission. 
After matching to control class imbalance, the Bi-LSTM model had area under the 
curve of 0.83 (95% CI 0.82-0.83). Heart rate, respiratory rate, and mean 
arterial pressure contributed most to the model.
CONCLUSIONS: We used Bi-LSTM to develop a model to predict the need for 
vasopressor for critically ill patients for the first 24 h of ICU admission. 
With attention mechanism, respiratory rate, mean arterial pressure, and heart 
rate were identified as key sequential determinants of vasopressor requirements.

BACKGROUND: Accurate patient outcome prediction in the intensive care unit (ICU) 
can potentially lead to more effective and efficient patient care. Deep learning 
models are capable of learning from data to accurately predict patient outcomes, 
but they typically require large amounts of data and computational resources. 
Transfer learning (TL) can help in scenarios where data and computational 
resources are scarce by leveraging pretrained models. While TL has been widely 
used in medical imaging and natural language processing, it has been rare in 
electronic health record (EHR) analysis. Furthermore, domain adaptation (DA) has 
been the most common TL method in general, whereas inductive transfer learning 
(ITL) has been rare. To the best of our knowledge, DA and ITL have never been 
studied in-depth in the context of EHR-based ICU patient outcome prediction.
OBJECTIVE: This study investigated DA, as well as rarely researched ITL, in 
EHR-based ICU patient outcome prediction under simulated, varying levels of data 
scarcity.
METHODS: Two patient cohorts were used in this study: (1) eCritical, a 
multicenter ICU data from 55,689 unique admission records from 48,672 unique 
patients admitted to 15 medical-surgical ICUs in Alberta, Canada, between March 
2013 and December 2019, and (2) Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care III, 
a single-center, publicly available ICU data set from Boston, Massachusetts, 
acquired between 2001 and 2012 containing 61,532 admission records from 46,476 
patients. We compared DA and ITL models with baseline models (without TL) of 
fully connected neural networks, logistic regression, and lasso regression in 
the prediction of 30-day mortality, acute kidney injury, ICU length of stay, and 
hospital length of stay. Random subsets of training data, ranging from 1% to 
75%, as well as the full data set, were used to compare the performances of DA 
and ITL with the baseline models at various levels of data scarcity.
RESULTS: Overall, the ITL models outperformed the baseline models in 55 of 56 
comparisons (all P values <.001). The DA models outperformed the baseline models 
in 45 of 56 comparisons (all P values <.001). ITL resulted in better performance 
than DA in terms of the number of times and the margin with which it 
outperformed the baseline models. In 11 of 16 cases (8 of 8 for ITL and 3 of 8 
for DA), TL models outperformed baseline models when trained using 1% data 
subset.
CONCLUSIONS: TL-based ICU patient outcome prediction models are useful in 
data-scarce scenarios. The results of this study can be used to estimate ICU 
outcome prediction performance at different levels of data scarcity, with and 
without TL. The publicly available pretrained models from this study can serve 
as building blocks in further research for the development and validation of 
models in other ICU cohorts and outcomes.

OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study was to develop and validate a predictive 
model based on a machine learning (ML) approach to identify patients with DKA at 
increased risk of AKI within 1 week of hospitalization in the intensive care 
unit (ICU).
METHODS: Patients diagnosed with DKA from the Medical Information Mart for 
Intensive Care IV (MIMIC-IV) database according to the International 
Classification of Diseases (ICD)-9/10 code were included. The patient's medical 
history is extracted, along with data on their demographics, vital signs, 
clinical characteristics, laboratory results, and therapeutic measures. The 
best-performing model is chosen by contrasting the 8 Ml models. The area under 
the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC), sensitivity, accuracy, and 
specificity were calculated to select the best-performing ML model.
RESULTS: The final study enrolled 1,322 patients with DKA in total, randomly 
split into training (1,124, 85%) and validation sets (198, 15%). 497 (37.5%) of 
them experienced AKI within a week of being admitted to the ICU. The eXtreme 
Gradient Boosting (XGBoost) model performed best of the 8 Ml models, and the AUC 
of the training and validation sets were 0.835 and 0.800, respectively. 
According to the result of feature importance, the top 5 main features 
contributing to the XGBoost model were blood urea nitrogen (BUN), urine output, 
weight, age, and platelet count (PLT).
CONCLUSION: An ML-based individual prediction model for DKA-associated AKI 
(DKA-AKI) was developed and validated. The model performs robustly, identifies 
high-risk patients early, can assist in clinical decision-making, and can 
improve the prognosis of DKA patients to some extent.

The Application of Machine Learning in Predicting Mortality Risk in Patients 
With Severe Femoral Neck Fractures: Prediction Model Development Study.

BACKGROUND: Femoral neck fracture (FNF) accounts for approximately 3.58% of all 
fractures in the entire body, exhibiting an increasing trend each year. 
According to a survey, in 1990, the total number of hip fractures in men and 
women worldwide was approximately 338,000 and 917,000, respectively. In China, 
FNFs account for 48.22% of hip fractures. Currently, many studies have been 
conducted on postdischarge mortality and mortality risk in patients with FNF. 
However, there have been no definitive studies on in-hospital mortality or its 
influencing factors in patients with severe FNF admitted to the intensive care 
unit.
OBJECTIVE: In this paper, 3 machine learning methods were used to construct a 
nosocomial death prediction model for patients admitted to intensive care units 
to assist clinicians in early clinical decision-making.
METHODS: A retrospective analysis was conducted using information of a patient 
with FNF from the Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care III. After 
balancing the data set using the Synthetic Minority Oversampling Technique 
algorithm, patients were randomly separated into a 70% training set and a 30% 
testing set for the development and validation, respectively, of the prediction 
model. Random forest, extreme gradient boosting, and backpropagation neural 
network prediction models were constructed with nosocomial death as the outcome. 
Model performance was assessed using the area under the receiver operating 
characteristic curve, accuracy, precision, sensitivity, and specificity. The 
predictive value of the models was verified in comparison to the traditional 
logistic model.
RESULTS: A total of 366 patients with FNFs were selected, including 48 cases 
(13.1%) of in-hospital death. Data from 636 patients were obtained by balancing 
the data set with the in-hospital death group to survival group as 1:1. The 3 
machine learning models exhibited high predictive accuracy, and the area under 
the receiver operating characteristic curve of the random forest, extreme 
gradient boosting, and backpropagation neural network were 0.98, 0.97, and 0.95, 
respectively, all with higher predictive performance than the traditional 
logistic regression model. Ranking the importance of the feature variables, the 
top 10 feature variables that were meaningful for predicting the risk of 
in-hospital death of patients were the Simplified Acute Physiology Score II, 
lactate, creatinine, gender, vitamin D, calcium, creatine kinase, creatine 
kinase isoenzyme, white blood cell, and age.
CONCLUSIONS: Death risk assessment models constructed using machine learning 
have positive significance for predicting the in-hospital mortality of patients 
with severe disease and provide a valid basis for reducing in-hospital mortality 
and improving patient prognosis.

Electronic health records (EHRs) are used in hospitals to store diagnoses, 
clinician notes, examinations, lab results, and interventions for each patient. 
Grouping patients into distinct subsets, for example, via clustering, may enable 
the discovery of unknown disease patterns or comorbidities, which could 
eventually lead to better treatment through personalized medicine. Patient data 
derived from EHRs is heterogeneous and temporally irregular. Therefore, 
traditional machine learning methods like PCA are ill-suited for analysis of 
EHR-derived patient data. We propose to address these issues with a new 
methodology based on training a gated recurrent unit (GRU) autoencoder directly 
on health record data. Our method learns a low-dimensional feature space by 
training on patient data time series, where the time of each data point is 
expressed explicitly. We use positional encodings for time, allowing our model 
to better handle the temporal irregularity of the data. We apply our method to 
data from the Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care (MIMIC-III). Using our 
data-derived feature space, we can cluster patients into groups representing 
major classes of disease patterns. Additionally, we show that our feature space 
exhibits a rich substructure at multiple scales.

BACKGROUND: Data sharing has been a big challenge in biomedical informatics 
because of privacy concerns. Contextual embedding models have demonstrated a 
very strong representative capability to describe medical concepts (and their 
context), and they have shown promise as an alternative way to support 
deep-learning applications without the need to disclose original data. However, 
contextual embedding models acquired from individual hospitals cannot be 
directly combined because their embedding spaces are different, and naive 
pooling renders combined embeddings useless.
OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to present a novel approach to address 
these issues and to promote sharing representation without sharing data. Without 
sacrificing privacy, we also aimed to build a global model from representations 
learned from local private data and synchronize information from multiple 
sources.
METHODS: We propose a methodology that harmonizes different local contextual 
embeddings into a global model. We used Word2Vec to generate contextual 
embeddings from each source and Procrustes to fuse different vector models into 
one common space by using a list of corresponding pairs as anchor points. We 
performed prediction analysis with harmonized embeddings.
RESULTS: We used sequential medical events extracted from the Medical 
Information Mart for Intensive Care III database to evaluate the proposed 
methodology in predicting the next likely diagnosis of a new patient using 
either structured data or unstructured data. Under different experimental 
scenarios, we confirmed that the global model built from harmonized local models 
achieves a more accurate prediction than local models and global models built 
from naive pooling.
CONCLUSIONS: Such aggregation of local models using our unique harmonization can 
serve as the proxy for a global model, combining information from a wide range 
of institutions and information sources. It allows information unique to a 
certain hospital to become available to other sites, increasing the fluidity of 
information flow in health care.

Unnecessary antibiotic regimens in the intensive care unit (ICU) are associated 
with adverse patient outcomes and antimicrobial resistance. Bacterial infections 
(BI) are both common and deadly in ICUs, and as a result, patients with a 
suspected BI are routinely started on broad-spectrum antibiotics prior to having 
confirmatory microbiologic culture results or when an occult BI is suspected, a 
practice known as empiric antibiotic therapy (EAT). However, EAT guidelines lack 
consensus and existing methods to quantify patient-level BI risk rely largely on 
clinical judgement and inaccurate biomarkers or expensive diagnostic tests. As a 
consequence, patients with low risk of BI often are continued on EAT, exposing 
them to unnecessary side effects. Augmenting current intuition-based practices 
with data-driven predictions of BI risk could help inform clinical decisions to 
shorten the duration of unnecessary EAT and improve patient outcomes. We propose 
a novel framework to identify ICU patients with low risk of BI as candidates for 
earlier EAT discontinuation. For this study, patients suspected of having a 
community-acquired BI were identified in the Medical Information Mart for 
Intensive Care III (MIMIC-III) dataset and categorized based on microbiologic 
culture results and EAT duration. Using structured longitudinal data collected 
up to 24-, 48-, and 72-hours after starting EAT, our best models identified 
patients at low risk of BI with AUROCs up to 0.8 and negative predictive values 
>93%. Overall, these results demonstrate the feasibility of forecasting BI risk 
in a critical care setting using patient features found in the electronic health 
record and call for more extensive research in this promising, yet relatively 
understudied, area.

INTRODUCTION: Cardiac arrest (CA), characterized by its heterogeneity, poses 
challenges in patient management. This study aimed to identify clinical 
subphenotypes in CA patients to aid in patient classification, prognosis 
assessment, and treatment decision-making.
METHODS: For this study, comprehensive data were extracted from the Medical 
Information Mart for Intensive Care IV (MIMIC-IV) 2.0 database. We excluded 
patients under 18 years old, those not initially admitted to the intensive care 
unit (ICU), or treated in the ICU for less than 72 h. A total of 57 clinical 
parameters relevant to CA patients were selected for analysis. These included 
demographic data, vital signs, and laboratory parameters. After an extensive 
literature review and expert consultations, key factors such as temperature (T), 
sodium (Na), creatinine (CR), glucose (GLU), heart rate (HR), PaO2/FiO2 ratio 
(P/F), hemoglobin (HB), mean arterial pressure (MAP), platelets (PLT), and white 
blood cell count (WBC) were identified as the most significant for cluster 
analysis. Consensus cluster analysis was utilized to examine the mean values of 
these routine clinical parameters within the first 24 h post-ICU admission to 
categorize patient classes. Furthermore, in-hospital and 28-day mortality rates 
of patients across different CA subphenotypes were assessed using multivariate 
logistic and Cox regression analysis.
RESULTS: After applying exclusion criteria, 719 CA patients were included in the 
study, with a median age of 67.22 years (IQR: 55.50-79.34), of whom 63.28% were 
male. The analysis delineated two distinct subphenotypes: Subphenotype 1 (SP1) 
and Subphenotype 2 (SP2). Compared to SP1, patients in SP2 exhibited 
significantly higher levels of P/F, HB, MAP, PLT, and Na, but lower levels of T, 
HR, GLU, WBC, and CR. SP2 patients had a notably higher in-hospital mortality 
rate compared to SP1 (53.01% for SP2 vs. 39.36% for SP1, P < 0.001). 28-day 
mortality decreased continuously for both subphenotypes, with a more rapid 
decline in SP2. These differences remained significant after adjusting for 
potential covariates (adjusted OR = 1.82, 95% CI: 1.26-2.64, P = 0.002; 
HR = 1.84, 95% CI: 1.40-2.41, P < 0.001).
CONCLUSIONS: The study successfully identified two distinct clinical 
subphenotypes of CA by analyzing routine clinical data from the first 24 h 
following ICU admission. SP1 was characterized by a lower rate of in-hospital 
and 28-day mortality when compared to SP2. This differentiation could play a 
crucial role in tailoring patient care, assessing prognosis, and guiding more 
targeted treatment strategies for CA patients.

BACKGROUND: The relationship between baseline hemoglobin levels and in-hospital 
mortality in septic patients remains unclear. This study aimed to clarify this 
association in critically ill patients with sepsis.
METHODS: Patients with sepsis were retrospectively identified from the Medical 
Information Mart for Intensive Care-IV (MIMIC-IV 2.2) and eICU Collaborative 
Research Database (eICU-CRD). Multivariate logistic regression analysis and 
restricted cubic spline regression were used to investigate the association 
between hemoglobin and the risk of in-hospital mortality. Additionally, a 
two-part linear regression model was used to determine threshold effects. 
Stratified analyses were also performed.
RESULTS: A total of 21,946 patients from MIMIC-IV and 15,495 patients from 
eICU-CRD were included in the study. In-hospital mortality was 14.95% in 
MIMIC-IV and 17.40% in eICU-CRD. Multivariate logistic regression showed that 
hemoglobin was significantly and nonlinearly associated with the risk of 
in-hospital mortality after adjusting for other covariates. Furthermore, we 
found a nonlinear association between hemoglobin and in-hospital mortality, with 
mortality plateauing at 10.2 g/dL. The risk of mortality decreased with 
increasing hemoglobin levels below 10.2 g/dL but increased when hemoglobin 
levels exceeded 10.2 g/dL. These findings were validated in the eICU-CRD 
dataset.
CONCLUSIONS: A nonlinear correlation between hemoglobin levels and in-hospital 
mortality was observed in patients with sepsis, with a threshold of 10.2 g/DL. 
These findings suggested that hemoglobin levels below or above the threshold may 
be associated with worse outcomes, warranting further investigation in 
prospective studies.

Background: Sepsis-associated acute kidney injury (AKI) is frequent in patients 
admitted to intensive care units (ICU) and may contribute to adverse short-term 
and long-term outcomes. Acute kidney disease (AKD) reflects the adverse events 
developing after AKI. We aimed to develop and validate machine learning models 
to predict the occurrence of AKD in patients with sepsis-associated AKI. 
Methods: Using clinical data from patients with sepsis in the ICU at Beijing 
Friendship Hospital (BFH), we studied whether the following three machine 
learning models could predict the occurrence of AKD using demographic, 
laboratory, and other related variables: Recurrent Neural Network-Long 
Short-Term Memory (RNN-LSTM), decision trees, and logistic regression. In 
addition, we externally validated the results in the Medical Information Mart 
for Intensive Care III (MIMIC III) database. The outcome was the diagnosis of 
AKD when defined as AKI prolonged for 7-90 days according to Acute Disease 
Quality Initiative-16. Results: In this study, 209 patients from BFH were 
included, with 55.5% of them diagnosed as having AKD. Furthermore, 509 patients 
were included from the MIMIC III database, of which 46.4% were diagnosed as 
having AKD. Applying machine learning could successfully achieve very high 
accuracy (RNN-LSTM AUROC = 1; decision trees AUROC = 0.954; logistic regression 
AUROC = 0.728), with RNN-LSTM showing the best results. Further analyses 
revealed that the change of non-renal Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (SOFA) 
score between the 1st day and 3rd day (Δnon-renal SOFA) is instrumental in 
predicting the occurrence of AKD. Conclusion: Our results showed that machine 
learning, particularly RNN-LSTM, can accurately predict AKD occurrence. In 
addition, Δ SOFAnon-renal plays an important role in predicting the occurrence 
of AKD.

BACKGROUND: In the intensive care unit (ICU), delirium is a common, acute, 
confusional state associated with high risk for short- and long-term morbidity 
and mortality. Machine learning (ML) has promise to address research priorities 
and improve delirium outcomes. However, due to clinical and billing conventions, 
delirium is often inconsistently or incompletely labeled in electronic health 
record (EHR) datasets. Here, we identify clinical actions abstracted from 
clinical guidelines in electronic health records (EHR) data that indicate risk 
of delirium among intensive care unit (ICU) patients. We develop a novel 
prediction model to label patients with delirium based on a large data set and 
assess model performance.
METHODS: EHR data on 48,451 admissions from 2001 to 2012, available through 
Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care-III database (MIMIC-III), was used 
to identify features to develop our prediction models. Five binary ML 
classification models (Logistic Regression; Classification and Regression Trees; 
Random Forests; Naïve Bayes; and Support Vector Machines) were fit and ranked by 
Area Under the Curve (AUC) scores. We compared our best model with two models 
previously proposed in the literature for goodness of fit, precision, and 
through biological validation.
RESULTS: Our best performing model with threshold reclassification for 
predicting delirium was based on a multiple logistic regression using the 31 
clinical actions (AUC 0.83). Our model out performed other proposed models by 
biological validation on clinically meaningful, delirium-associated outcomes.
CONCLUSIONS: Hurdles in identifying accurate labels in large-scale datasets 
limit clinical applications of ML in delirium. We developed a novel labeling 
model for delirium in the ICU using a large, public data set. By using 
guideline-directed clinical actions independent from risk factors, treatments, 
and outcomes as model predictors, our classifier could be used as a delirium 
label for future clinically targeted models.

BACKGROUND: Trauma patients admitted to critical care are at high risk of 
mortality because of their injuries. Our aim was to develop a machine 
learning-based model to predict mortality using Fahad-Liaqat-Ahmad Intensive 
Machine (FLAIM) framework. We hypothesized machine learning could be applied to 
critically ill patients and would outperform currently used mortality scores.
METHODS: The current Deep-FLAIM model evaluates the statistically significant 
risk factors and then supply these risk factors to deep neural network to 
predict mortality in trauma patients admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU). 
We analyzed adult patients (≥18 years) admitted to the trauma ICU in the 
publicly available database Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care III 
version 1.4. The first phase selection of risk factor was done using 
Cox-regression univariate and multivariate analyses. In the second phase, we 
applied deep neural network and other traditional machine learning models like 
Linear Discriminant Analysis, Gaussian Naïve Bayes, Decision Tree Model, and 
k-nearest neighbor models.
RESULTS: We identified a total of 3,041 trauma patients admitted to the trauma 
surgery ICU. We observed that several clinical and laboratory-based variables 
were statistically significant for both univariate and multivariate analyses 
while others were not. With most significant being serum anion gap (hazard ratio 
[HR], 2.46; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.94-3.11), sodium (HR, 2.11; 95% CI, 
1.61-2.77), and chloride (HR, 2.11; 95% CI, 1.69-2.64) abnormalities on 
laboratories, while clinical variables included the diagnosis of sepsis (HR, 
2.03; 95% CI, 1.23-3.37), Quick Sequential Organ Failure Assessment score (HR, 
1.52; 95% CI, 1.32-3.76). And Systemic Inflammatory Response Syndrome criteria 
(HR. 1.41; 95% CI, 1.24-1.26). After we used these clinically significant 
variables and applied various machine learning models to the data, we found out 
that our proposed DNN outperformed all the other methods with test set accuracy 
of 92.25%, sensitivity of 79.13%, and specificity of 94.16%; positive predictive 
value, 66.42%; negative predictive value, 96.87%; and area under the curve of 
the receiver-operator curve of 0.91 (1.45-1.29).
CONCLUSION: Our novel Deep-FLAIM model outperformed all other machine learning 
models. The model is easy to implement, user friendly and with high accuracy.

OBJECTIVES: Unplanned readmissions to the intensive care unit (ICU) are highly 
undesirable, increasing variance in care, making resource planning difficult and 
potentially increasing length of stay and mortality in some settings. 
Identifying patients who are likely to suffer unplanned ICU readmission could 
reduce the frequency of this adverse event.
SETTING: A single academic, tertiary care hospital in the UK.
PARTICIPANTS: A set of 3326 ICU episodes collected between October 2014 and 
August 2016. All records were of patients who visited an ICU at some point 
during their stay. We excluded patients who were ≤16 years of age; visited ICUs 
other than the general and neurosciences ICU; were missing crucial electronic 
patient record measurements; or had indeterminate ICU discharge outcomes or very 
early or extremely late discharge times. After exclusion, 2018 outcome-labelled 
episodes remained.
PRIMARY AND SECONDARY OUTCOME MEASURES: Area under the receiver operating 
characteristic curve (AUROC) for prediction of unplanned ICU readmission or 
in-hospital death within 48 hours of first ICU discharge.
RESULTS: In 10-fold cross-validation, an ensemble predictor was trained on data 
from both the target hospital and the Medical Information Mart for Intensive 
Care (MIMIC-III) database and tested on the target hospital's data. This 
predictor discriminated between patients with the unplanned ICU readmission or 
death outcome and those without this outcome, attaining mean AUROC of 0.7095 (SE 
0.0260), superior to the purpose-built Stability and Workload Index for Transfer 
(SWIFT) score (AUROC=0.6082, SE 0.0249; p=0.014, pairwise t-test).
CONCLUSIONS: Despite the inherent difficulties, we demonstrate that a novel 
machine learning algorithm based on transfer learning could achieve good 
discrimination, over and above that of the treating clinicians or the value 
added by the SWIFT score. Accurate prediction of unplanned readmission could be 
used to target resources more efficiently.

Foundation models are transforming artificial intelligence (AI) in healthcare by 
providing modular components adaptable for various downstream tasks, making AI 
development more scalable and cost-effective. Foundation models for structured 
electronic health records (EHR), trained on coded medical records from millions 
of patients, demonstrated benefits including increased performance with fewer 
training labels, and improved robustness to distribution shifts. However, 
questions remain on the feasibility of sharing these models across hospitals and 
their performance in local tasks. This multi-center study examined the 
adaptability of a publicly accessible structured EHR foundation model (FMSM), 
trained on 2.57 M patient records from Stanford Medicine. Experiments used EHR 
data from The Hospital for Sick Children (SickKids) and Medical Information Mart 
for Intensive Care (MIMIC-IV). We assessed both adaptability via continued 
pretraining on local data, and task adaptability compared to baselines of 
locally training models from scratch, including a local foundation model. 
Evaluations on 8 clinical prediction tasks showed that adapting the 
off-the-shelf FMSM matched the performance of gradient boosting machines (GBM) 
locally trained on all data while providing a 13% improvement in settings with 
few task-specific training labels. Continued pretraining on local data showed 
FMSM required fewer than 1% of training examples to match the fully trained 
GBM's performance, and was 60 to 90% more sample-efficient than training local 
foundation models from scratch. Our findings demonstrate that adapting EHR 
foundation models across hospitals provides improved prediction performance at 
less cost, underscoring the utility of base foundation models as modular 
components to streamline the development of healthcare AI.

BACKGROUND: The incidence, mortality, and readmission rates for acute heart 
failure (AHF) are high, and the in-hospital mortality for AHF patients in the 
intensive care unit (ICU) is higher. However, there is currently no method to 
accurately predict the mortality of AHF patients.
METHODS: The Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care Ⅳ (MIMIC-Ⅳ) database 
was used to perform a retrospective study. Patients meeting the inclusion 
criteria were identified from the MIMIC-Ⅳ database and randomly divided into a 
training set (n = 3,580, 70%) and a validation set (n = 1,534, 30%). The 
variates collected include demographic data, vital signs, comorbidities, 
laboratory test results, and treatment information within 24 hours of ICU 
admission. By using the least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) 
regression model in the training set, variates that affect the in-hospital 
mortality of AHF patients were screened. Subsequently, in the training set, five 
common machine learning (ML) algorithms were applied to construct models using 
variates selected by LASSO to predict the in-hospital mortality of AHF patients. 
The predictive ability of the models was evaluated for sensitivity, specificity, 
accuracy, the area under the curve of receiver operating characteristics, and 
clinical net benefit in the validation set. To obtain a model with the best 
predictive ability, the predictive ability of common scoring systems was 
compared with the best ML model.
RESULTS: Among the 5,114 patients, in-hospital mortality was 12.5%. Comparing 
the area under the curve, the XGBoost model had the best predictive ability 
among all ML models, and the XGBoost model was chosen as the final model for its 
higher net benefit. Its predictive ability was superior to common scoring 
systems.
CONCLUSIONS: The XGBoost model can effectively predict the in-hospital mortality 
of AHF patients admitted to the ICU, which may assist clinicians in precise 
management and early intervention for patients with AHF to reduce mortality.

BACKGROUND: Machine learning has advanced medical event prediction, mostly using 
private data. The public MIMIC-3 (Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care 
III) data set, which contains detailed data on over 40,000 intensive care unit 
patients, stands out as it can help develop better models including structured 
and textual data.
OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to build and test a machine learning model using the 
MIMIC-3 data set to determine the effectiveness of information extracted from 
electronic medical record text using a named entity recognition, specifically 
QuickUMLS, for predicting important medical events. Using the prediction of 
extended-spectrum β-lactamase (ESBL)-producing bacterial infections as an 
example, this study shows how open data sources and simple technology can be 
useful for making clinically meaningful predictions.
METHODS: The MIMIC-3 data set, including demographics, vital signs, laboratory 
results, and textual data, such as discharge summaries, was used. This study 
specifically targeted patients diagnosed with Klebsiella pneumoniae or 
Escherichia coli infection. Predictions were based on ESBL-producing bacterial 
standards and the minimum inhibitory concentration criteria. Both the structured 
data and extracted patient histories were used as predictors. In total, 2 
models, an L1-regularized logistic regression model and a LightGBM model, were 
evaluated using the receiver operating characteristic area under the curve 
(ROC-AUC) and the precision-recall curve area under the curve (PR-AUC).
RESULTS: Of 46,520 MIMIC-3 patients, 4046 were identified with bacterial 
cultures, indicating the presence of K pneumoniae or E coli. After excluding 
patients who lacked discharge summary text, 3614 patients remained. The 
L1-penalized model, with variables from only the structured data, displayed a 
ROC-AUC of 0.646 and a PR-AUC of 0.307. The LightGBM model, combining structured 
and textual data, achieved a ROC-AUC of 0.707 and a PR-AUC of 0.369. Key 
contributors to the LightGBM model included patient age, duration since hospital 
admission, and specific medical history such as diabetes. The structured 
data-based model showed improved performance compared to the reference models. 
Performance was further improved when textual medical history was included. 
Compared to other models predicting drug-resistant bacteria, the results of this 
study ranked in the middle. Some misidentifications, potentially due to the 
limitations of QuickUMLS, may have affected the accuracy of the model.
CONCLUSIONS: This study successfully developed a predictive model for 
ESBL-producing bacterial infections using the MIMIC-3 data set, yielding results 
consistent with existing literature. This model stands out for its transparency 
and reliance on open data and open-named entity recognition technology. The 
performance of the model was enhanced using textual information. With 
advancements in natural language processing tools such as BERT and GPT, the 
extraction of medical data from text holds substantial potential for future 
model optimization.

BACKGROUND: The presence of acute kidney injury (AKI) significantly increases 
in-hospital mortality risk for cirrhotic patients. Early prognosis prediction 
for these patients is crucial. We aimed to develop and validate a machine 
learning model for in-hospital mortality prediction for cirrhotic patients with 
AKI.
METHODS: Data from cirrhotic patients with AKI hospitalized at the First 
Affiliated Hospital of Zhejiang University between January 1, 2013, and December 
31, 2020 were used to train and validate an extreme Gradient Boosting model to 
predict in-hospital mortality risk. The Boruta algorithm was used for variable 
selection. The optimal model was selected and named as PHM-CPA (Prediction of 
in-Hospital Mortality for Cirrhotic Patients with AKI). The PHM-CPA model was 
then externally validated in patients from eICU Collaborative Research Database 
(eICU-CRD) and Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care III dataset (MIMIC). 
The predictive performance of PHM-CPA model was compared with that of logistic 
regression (LR) model and 25 previously reported models.
RESULTS: A total of 519 cirrhotic patients with AKI were enrolled in model 
training cohort, of whom 118 (23%) died during hospitalization. Fifteen 
variables from common laboratory tests were selected to develop the PHM-CPA 
model. The PHM-CPA model achieved an AUROC of 0.816 (95% CI, 0.763-0.861) in the 
internal validation cohort and 0.787 (95% CI, 0.745-0.830) in the external 
validation cohort. The PHM-CPA model consistently outperformed the LR model and 
25 previously reported models.
CONCLUSION: We developed and validated the PHM-CPA model, comprising readily 
available clinical variables, which demonstrated superior performance and 
calibration in predicting in-hospital mortality for cirrhotic patients with AKI.

RATIONALE AND OBJECTIVES: The process of generating radiology reports is often 
time-consuming and labor-intensive, prone to incompleteness, heterogeneity, and 
errors. By employing natural language processing (NLP)-based techniques, this 
study explores the potential for enhancing the efficiency of radiology report 
generation through the remarkable capabilities of ChatGPT (Generative 
Pre-training Transformer), a prominent large language model (LLM).
MATERIALS AND METHODS: Using a sample of 1000 records from the Medical 
Information Mart for Intensive Care (MIMIC) Chest X-ray Database, this 
investigation employed Claude.ai to extract initial radiological report 
keywords. ChatGPT then generated radiology reports using a consistent 3-step 
prompt template outline. Various lexical and sentence similarity techniques were 
employed to evaluate the correspondence between the AI assistant-generated 
reports and reference reports authored by medical professionals.
RESULTS: Results showed varying performance among NLP models, with Bart 
(Bidirectional and Auto-Regressive Transformers) and XLM (Cross-lingual Language 
Model) displaying high proficiency (mean similarity scores up to 99.3%), closely 
mirroring physician reports. Conversely, DeBERTa (Decoding-enhanced BERT with 
disentangled attention) and sequence-matching models scored lower, indicating 
less alignment with medical language. In the Impression section, the 
Word-Embedding model excelled with a mean similarity of 84.4%, while others like 
the Jaccard index showed lower performance.
CONCLUSION: Overall, the study highlights significant variations across NLP 
models in their ability to generate radiology reports consistent with medical 
professionals' language. Pairwise comparisons and Kruskal-Wallis tests confirmed 
these differences, emphasizing the need for careful selection and evaluation of 
NLP models in radiology report generation. This research underscores the 
potential of ChatGPT to streamline and improve the radiology reporting process, 
with implications for enhancing efficiency and accuracy in clinical practice.

BACKGROUND: Unnecessary laboratory tests contribute to iatrogenic harm and are a 
major source of waste in the health care system. We previously developed a 
machine learning algorithm to help clinicians identify unnecessary laboratory 
tests, but it has not been externally validated. In this study, we externally 
validate our machine learning algorithm.
METHODS: To externally validate the machine learning algorithm that was 
originally trained on the Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care (MIMIC) 
III database, we tested the algorithm in a separate institution. We identified 
and abstracted data for all patients older than 18 years admitted to the 
intensive care unit at Memorial Hermann Hospital in Houston, Texas (MHH) from 
January 1, 2020 to November 13, 2020. Using the transfer learning style, we 
performed external validation of the machine learning algorithm.
RESULTS: A total of 651 MHH patients were included. The model performed well in 
predicting abnormality (area under the curve [AUC] 0.98 for MIMIC III and 0.89 
for MHH). The model performed similarly in predicting transitions from normal 
laboratory range to abnormal (AUC 0.71 for MIMIC III and 0.70 for MHH). The 
performance of the model in predicting the actual laboratory value was also 
similar in the MIMIC III (accuracy 0.41) and MHH data (0.45).
CONCLUSIONS: We externally validated the machine learning model and showed that 
the model performed similarly, supporting the generalizability to other 
settings. While this model demonstrated good performance for predicting abnormal 
labs and transitions, it does not perform well enough for prediction of 
laboratory values in most clinical applications.

Preliminary Results on Density Poincare Plot Based Atrial Fibrillation Detection 
from Premature Atrial/Ventricular Contractions().

Bashar SK, Han D, Zieneddin F, Ding E, Walkey AJ, McManus DD, Chon KH.

Detection of Atrial fibrillation (AF) from premature atrial contraction (PAC) 
and premature ventricular contraction (PVC) is challenging as frequent 
occurrences of these ectopic beats can mimic the typical irregular patterns of 
AF. In this paper, we present a preliminary study of using density Poincare plot 
based machine learning method to detect AF from PAC/PVCs using electrocardiogram 
(ECG) recordings. First, we propose creation of this new density Poincare plot 
which is derived from the difference of the heart rate. Next, from this density 
Poincare plot, template correlation and discrete wavelet transform are used to 
extract suitable image-based features, which is followed by infinite latent 
feature selection algorithm to rank the features. Finally, classification of AF 
vs PAC/PVC is performed using K-Nearest Neighbor, discriminant analysis and 
support vector machine (SVM) classifiers. Our method is developed and validated 
using a subset of Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care (MIMIC) III 
database containing 8 AF and 8 PAC/PVC subjects. Both 10-fold and 
leave-one-subject-out cross validations are performed to show the robustness of 
our proposed method. During the 10-fold cross-validation, SVM achieved the best 
performance with 99.49% sensitivity, 94.51% specificity and 97.29% accuracy with 
the extracted features while for the leave-one-subject-out, the highest overall 
accuracy is 90.91%. Moreover, when compared with two state-of-the-art methods, 
the proposed algorithm achieves superior AF vs. PAC/PVC discrimination 
performance.Clinical Relevance-This preliminary study shows that with the help 
of density Poincare plot, AF can be separated from PAC/PVC with better accuracy.

BACKGROUND: Acute kidney injury (AKI) is associated with increased mortality in 
critically ill patients. Due to differences in the etiology and 
pathophysiological mechanism, the current AKI criteria put it an embarrassment 
to evaluate clinical therapy and prognosis.
OBJECTIVE: We aimed to identify subphenotypes based on routinely collected 
clinical data to expose the unique pathophysiologic patterns.
METHODS: A retrospective study was conducted based on the Medical Information 
Mart for Intensive Care IV (MIMIC-IV) and the eICU Collaborative Research 
Database (eICU-CRD), and a deep clustering approach was conducted to derive 
subphenotypes. We conducted further analysis to uncover the underlying clinical 
patterns and interpret the subphenotype derivation.
RESULTS: We studied 14,189 and 19,382 patients with AKI within 48 h of ICU 
admission in the two datasets, respectively. Through our approach, we identified 
seven distinct AKI subphenotypes with mortality heterogeneity in each cohort. 
These subphenotypes displayed significant variations in demographics, 
comorbidities, levels of laboratory measurements, and survival patterns. 
Notably, the subphenotypes could not be effectively characterized using the 
Kidney Disease: Improving Global Outcomes (KDIGO) criteria alone. Therefore, we 
uncovered the unique underlying characteristics of each subphenotype through 
model-based interpretation. To assess the usability of the subphenotypes, we 
conducted an evaluation, which yielded a micro-Area Under the Receiver Operating 
Characteristic (AUROC) of 0.81 in the single-center cohort and 0.83 in the 
multi-center cohort within 48-hour of admission.
CONCLUSION: We derived highly characteristic, interpretable, and usable AKI 
subphenotypes that exhibited superior prognostic values.

BACKGROUND: Increasing digitalization in the medical domain gives rise to large 
amounts of health care data, which has the potential to expand clinical 
knowledge and transform patient care if leveraged through artificial 
intelligence (AI). Yet, big data and AI oftentimes cannot unlock their full 
potential at scale, owing to nonstandardized data formats, lack of technical and 
semantic data interoperability, and limited cooperation between stakeholders in 
the health care system. Despite the existence of standardized data formats for 
the medical domain, such as Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources (FHIR), 
their prevalence and usability for AI remain limited.
OBJECTIVE: In this paper, we developed a data harmonization pipeline (DHP) for 
clinical data sets relying on the common FHIR data standard.
METHODS: We validated the performance and usability of our FHIR-DHP with data 
from the Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care IV database.
RESULTS: We present the FHIR-DHP workflow in respect of the transformation of 
"raw" hospital records into a harmonized, AI-friendly data representation. The 
pipeline consists of the following 5 key preprocessing steps: querying of data 
from hospital database, FHIR mapping, syntactic validation, transfer of 
harmonized data into the patient-model database, and export of data in an 
AI-friendly format for further medical applications. A detailed example of 
FHIR-DHP execution was presented for clinical diagnoses records.
CONCLUSIONS: Our approach enables the scalable and needs-driven data modeling of 
large and heterogenous clinical data sets. The FHIR-DHP is a pivotal step toward 
increasing cooperation, interoperability, and quality of patient care in the 
clinical routine and for medical research.

Background: Acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) commonly develops in 
traumatic brain injury (TBI) patients and is a risk factor for poor prognosis. 
We designed this study to evaluate the performance of several machine learning 
algorithms for predicting ARDS in TBI patients. Methods: TBI patients from the 
Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care-III (MIMIC-III) database were 
eligible for this study. ARDS was identified according to the Berlin definition. 
Included TBI patients were divided into the training cohort and the validation 
cohort with a ratio of 7:3. Several machine learning algorithms were utilized to 
develop predictive models with five-fold cross validation for ARDS including 
extreme gradient boosting, light gradient boosting machine, Random Forest, 
adaptive boosting, complement naïve Bayes, and support vector machine. The 
performance of machine learning algorithms were evaluated by the area under the 
receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC), sensitivity, specificity, 
accuracy and F score. Results: 649 TBI patients from the MIMIC-III database were 
included with an ARDS incidence of 49.5%. The random forest performed the best 
in predicting ARDS in the training cohort with an AUC of 1.000. The XGBoost and 
AdaBoost ranked the second and the third with an AUC of 0.989 and 0.815 in the 
training cohort. The random forest still performed the best in predicting ARDS 
in the validation cohort with an AUC of 0.652. AdaBoost and XGBoost ranked the 
second and the third with an AUC of 0.631 and 0.620 in the validation cohort. 
Several mutual top features in the random forest and AdaBoost were discovered 
including age, initial systolic blood pressure and heart rate, Abbreviated 
Injury Score chest, white blood cells, platelets, and international normalized 
ratio. Conclusions: The random forest and AdaBoost based models have stable and 
good performance for predicting ARDS in TBI patients. These models could help 
clinicians to evaluate the risk of ARDS in early stages after TBI and 
consequently adjust treatment decisions.

In this study, we conducted research on a deep learning-based blood pressure 
(BP) estimation model suitable for wearable environments. To measure BP while 
wearing a wearable watch, it needs to be considered that computing power for 
signal processing is limited and the input signals are subject to noise 
interference. Therefore, we employed a convolutional neural network (CNN) as the 
BP estimation model and utilized time-series electrocardiogram (ECG) and 
photoplethysmogram (PPG) signals, which are quantifiable in a wearable context. 
We generated periodic input signals and used differential and thresholding 
methods to decrease noise in the preprocessing step. We then applied a 
max-pooling technique with filter sizes of 2 × 1 and 5 × 1 within a 3-layer 
convolutional neural network to estimate BP. Our method was trained, validated, 
and tested using 2.4 million data samples from 49 patients in the intensive care 
unit. These samples, totaling 3.1 GB were obtained from the publicly accessible 
MIMIC database. As a result of a test with 480,000 data samples, the average 
root mean square error in BP estimation was 3.41, 5.80, and 2.78 mm Hg in the 
prediction of pulse pressure, systolic BP (SBP), and diastolic BP (DBP), 
respectively. The cumulative error percentage less than 5 mm Hg was 68% and 93% 
for SBP and DBP, respectively. In addition, the cumulative error percentage less 
than 15 mm Hg was 98% and 99% for SBP and DBP. Subsequently, we evaluated the 
impact of changes in input signal length (1 cycle vs. 30 s) and the introduction 
of noise on BP estimation results. The experimental results revealed that the 
length of the input signal did not significantly affect the performance of 
CNN-based analysis. When estimating BP using noise-added ECG signals, the mean 
absolute error (MAE) for SBP and DBP was 9.72 and 6.67 mm Hg, respectively. 
Meanwhile, when using noise-added PPG signals, the MAE for SBP and DBP was 26.85 
and 14.00 mm Hg, respectively. Therefore, this study confirmed that using ECG 
signals rather than PPG signals is advantageous for noise reduction in a 
wearable environment. Besides, short sampling frames without calibration can be 
effective as input signals. Furthermore, it demonstrated that using a model 
suitable for information extraction rather than a specialized deep learning 
model for sequential data can yield satisfactory results in BP estimation.

OBJECTIVE: Easy access bio-signals are useful for alleviating the shortcomings 
and difficulties associated with cuff-based and invasive blood pressure (BP) 
measurement techniques. This study proposes a deep learning model, trained using 
knowledge distillation, based on photoplethysmographic (PPG) and 
electrocardiogram (ECG) signals to estimate systolic and diastolic blood 
pressures.
METHODS: The estimation model comprises convolutional layers followed by one 
bidirectional recurrent layer and attention layers. The training approach 
involves knowledge distillation, where a smaller model (student model) is 
trained by leveraging information from a larger model (teacher model).
RESULTS: The proposed multistage model was evaluated on 1205 subjects from 
Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care (MIMIC) III database using the 
Association for the Advancement of Medical Instrumentation (AAMI) and the 
standards of the British Hypertension Society (BHS). The results revealed that 
our model performance achieved grade A in estimating both systolic blood 
pressure (SBP) and diastolic blood pressure (DBP) and met the requirements of 
the AAMI standard. After training with knowledge distillation (KD), the model 
achieved a mean absolute error and standard deviation of 2.94 ± 5.61 mmHg for 
SBP and 2.02 ± 3.60 mmHg for DBP.
CONCLUSION: Our results demonstrate the benefits of the knowledge distillation 
training method in reducing the number of parameters and improving the 
predictive accuracy of the blood pressure regression model.

ADT²R: Adaptive Decision Transformer for Dynamic Treatment Regimes in Sepsis.

Jeon E, Choi JH, Suk HI.

Dynamic treatment regimes (DTRs), which comprise a series of decisions taken to 
select adequate treatments, have attracted considerable attention in the 
clinical domain, especially from sepsis researchers. Existing sepsis DTR 
learning studies are mainly based on offline reinforcement learning (RL) 
approaches working on electronic healthcare records data. However, a trained 
policy may choose a treatment different from a human clinician's prescription. 
Furthermore, most of them do not consider: 1) heterogeneity in sepsis; 2) 
short-term transitions; and 3) the relationship between a patient's health state 
and the prescription. We propose a novel framework, an adaptive decision 
transformer for DTR (ADT2R), which recommends an optimal treatment action for 
each time step depending on the heterogeneity of the sepsis and a patient's 
evolving health states. Specifically, we devise a trajectory-optimization-based 
module to be trained with supervision for treatments and adaptively aggregate 
the multihead self-attentions by deliberating on various inherent time-varying 
patterns among sepsis patients. Furthermore, we estimate the patient's health 
state by adopting an actor-critic (AC) algorithm and inform the treatment 
recommendation by learning about its short-term changes. We validated the 
effectiveness of the proposed framework on the Medical Information Mart for 
Intensive Care III (MIMIC-III) dataset, an extensive intensive care database, by 
demonstrating performance comparable to the state-of-the-art methods.

Embolic stroke (ES) is characterized by high morbidity and mortality. Its 
mortality predictors remain unclear. The present study aimed to use machine 
learning (ML) to identify the key predictors of mortality for ES patients in the 
intensive care unit (ICU). Data were extracted from two large ICU databases: 
Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care (MIMIC)-IV for training and internal 
validation, and eICU Collaborative Research Database (eICU-CRD) for external 
validation. We developed predictive models of ES mortality based on 15 ML 
algorithms. We relied on the synthetic minority oversampling technique (SMOTE) 
to address class imbalance. Our main performance metric was area under the 
receiver operating characteristic (AUROC). We adopted recursive feature 
elimination (RFE) for feature selection. We assessed model performance using 
three disease-severity scoring systems as benchmarks. Of the 1566 and 207 ES 
patients enrolled in the two databases, there were 173 (15.70%), 73 (15.57%), 
and 36 (17.39%) hospital mortality in the training, internal validation, and 
external validation cohort, respectively. The random forest (RF) model had the 
largest AUROC (0.806) in the internal validation phase and was chosen as the 
best model. The AUROC of the RF compact (RF-COM) model containing the top six 
features identified by RFE was 0.795. In the external validation phase, the 
AUROC of the RF model was 0.838, and the RF-COM model was 0.830, outperforming 
other models. Our findings suggest that the RF model was the best model and the 
top six predictors of ES hospital mortality were Glasgow Coma Scale, white blood 
cell, blood urea nitrogen, bicarbonate, age, and mechanical ventilation.

BACKGROUND: Acute kidney injury (AKI) carries a poor prognosis. Its incidence is 
increasing in the intensive care unit (ICU). Our purpose in this study is to 
develop and externally validate a model for predicting AKI in the ICU using 
patient data present prior to ICU admission.
METHODS: We used data of 98 472 adult ICU admissions at Mayo Clinic between 1 
January 2005 and 31 December 2017 and 51 801 encounters from Medical Information 
Mart for Intensive Care III (MIMIC-III) cohort. A gradient-boosting model was 
trained on 80% of the Mayo Clinic cohort using a set of features to predict AKI 
acquired in the ICU.
RESULTS: AKI was identified in 39 307 (39.9%) encounters in the Mayo Clinic 
cohort. Patients who developed AKI in the ICU were older and had higher ICU and 
in-hospital mortality compared to patients without AKI. A 30-feature model 
yielded an area under the receiver operating curve of 0.690 [95% confidence 
interval (CI) 0.682-0.697] in the Mayo Clinic cohort set and 0.656 (95% CI 
0.648-0.664) in the MIMIC-III cohort.
CONCLUSIONS: Using machine learning, AKI among ICU patients can be predicted 
using information available prior to admission. This model is independent of ICU 
information, making it valuable for stratifying patients at admission.

BACKGROUND: Cancer is a life-threatening disease and a leading cause of death 
worldwide, with an estimated 611,000 deaths and over 2 million new cases in the 
United States in 2024. The rising incidence of major cancers, including among 
younger individuals, highlights the need for early screening and monitoring of 
risk factors to manage and decrease cancer risk.
OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to leverage explainable machine learning models to 
identify and analyze the key risk factors associated with breast, colorectal, 
lung, and prostate cancers. By uncovering significant associations between risk 
factors and these major cancer types, we sought to enhance the understanding of 
cancer diagnosis risk profiles. Our goal was to facilitate more precise 
screening, early detection, and personalized prevention strategies, ultimately 
contributing to better patient outcomes and promoting health equity.
METHODS: Deidentified electronic health record data from Medical Information 
Mart for Intensive Care (MIMIC)-III was used to identify patients with 4 types 
of cancer who had longitudinal hospital visits prior to their diagnosis 
presence. Their records were matched and combined with those of patients without 
cancer diagnoses using propensity scores based on demographic factors. Three 
advanced models, penalized logistic regression, random forest, and multilayer 
perceptron (MLP), were conducted to identify the rank of risk factors for each 
cancer type, with feature importance analysis for random forest and MLP models. 
The rank biased overlap was adopted to compare the similarity of ranked risk 
factors across cancer types.
RESULTS: Our framework evaluated the prediction performance of explainable 
machine learning models, with the MLP model demonstrating the best performance. 
It achieved an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve of 0.78 
for breast cancer (n=58), 0.76 for colorectal cancer (n=140), 0.84 for lung 
cancer (n=398), and 0.78 for prostate cancer (n=104), outperforming other 
baseline models (P<.001). In addition to demographic risk factors, the most 
prominent nontraditional risk factors overlapped across models and cancer types, 
including hyperlipidemia (odds ratio [OR] 1.14, 95% CI 1.11-1.17; P<.01), 
diabetes (OR 1.34, 95% CI 1.29-1.39; P<.01), depressive disorders (OR 1.11, 95% 
CI 1.06-1.16; P<.01), heart diseases (OR 1.42, 95% CI 1.32-1.52; P<.01), and 
anemia (OR 1.22, 95% CI 1.14-1.30; P<.01). The similarity analysis indicated the 
unique risk factor pattern for lung cancer from other cancer types.
CONCLUSIONS: The study's findings demonstrated the effectiveness of explainable 
ML models in assessing nontraditional risk factors for major cancers and 
highlighted the importance of considering unique risk profiles for different 
cancer types. Moreover, this research served as a hypothesis-generating 
foundation, providing preliminary results for future investigation into cancer 
diagnosis risk analysis and management. Furthermore, expanding collaboration 
with clinical experts for external validation would be essential to refine model 
outputs, integrate findings into practice, and enhance their impact on patient 
care and cancer prevention efforts.

OBJECTIVE: Social determinants of health (SDOH) are non-medical factors that can 
profoundly impact patient health outcomes. However, SDOH are rarely available in 
structured electronic health record (EHR) data such as diagnosis codes, and more 
commonly found in unstructured narrative clinical notes. Hence, identifying 
social context from unstructured EHR data has become increasingly important. 
Yet, previous work on using natural language processing to automate extraction 
of SDOH from text (a) usually focuses on an ad hoc selection of SDOH, and (b) 
does not use the latest advances in deep learning. Our objective was to advance 
automatic extraction of SDOH from clinical text by (a) systematically creating a 
set of SDOH based on standard biomedical and psychiatric ontologies, and (b) 
training state-of-the-art deep neural networks to extract mentions of these SDOH 
from clinical notes.
DESIGN: A retrospective cohort study.
SETTING AND PARTICIPANTS: Data were extracted from the Medical Information Mart 
for Intensive Care (MIMIC-III) database. The corpus comprised 3,504 social 
related sentences from 2,670 clinical notes.
METHODS: We developed a framework for automated classification of multiple SDOH 
categories. Our dataset comprised narrative clinical notes under the "Social 
Work" category in the MIMIC-III Clinical Database. Using standard terminologies, 
SNOMED-CT and DSM-IV, we systematically curated a set of 13 SDOH categories and 
created annotation guidelines for these. After manually annotating the 3,504 
sentences, we developed and tested three deep neural network (DNN) architectures 
- convolutional neural network (CNN), long short-term memory (LSTM) network, and 
the Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers (BERT) - for 
automated detection of eight SDOH categories. We also compared these DNNs to 
three baselines models: (1) cTAKES, as well as (2) L2-regularized logistic 
regression and (3) random forests on bags-of-words. Model evaluation metrics 
included micro- and macro- F1, and area under the receiver operating 
characteristic curve (AUC).
RESULTS: All three DNN models accurately classified all SDOH categories (minimum 
micro-F1 = 0.632, minimum macro-AUC = 0.854). Compared to the CNN and LSTM, BERT 
performed best in most key metrics (micro-F1 = 0.690, macro-AUC = 0.907). The 
BERT model most effectively identified the "occupational" category (F1 = 0.774, 
AUC = 0.965) and least effectively identified the "non-SDOH" category 
(F = 0.491, AUC = 0.788). BERT outperformed cTAKES in distinguishing social vs 
non-social sentences (BERT F1 = 0.87 vs. cTAKES F1 = 0.06), and outperformed 
logistic regression (micro-F1 = 0.649, macro-AUC = 0.696) and random forest 
(micro-F1 = 0.502, macro-AUC = 0.523) trained on bag-of-words.
CONCLUSIONS: Our study framework with DNN models demonstrated improved 
performance for efficiently identifying a systematic range of SDOH categories 
from clinical notes in the EHR. Improved identification of patient SDOH may 
further improve healthcare outcomes.

Patients with positive blood cultures in the intensive care unit (ICU) are at 
high risk for septic acute kidney injury requiring continuous kidney replacement 
therapy (CKRT), especially when treated with vancomycin. This study developed a 
machine learning model to predict CKRT and examined vancomycin's impact using 
deep learning-based causal inference. We analyzed ICU patients with positive 
blood cultures, utilizing the Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care III 
data set. The primary outcome was defined as the initiation of CKRT during the 
ICU stay. The machine learning models were developed to predict the outcome. The 
deep learning-based causal inference model was utilized to quantitatively 
demonstrate the impact of vancomycin on the probability of CKRT initiation. 
Logistic regression was performed to analyze the relationship between the 
variables and the susceptibility of vancomycin. A total of 1,318 patients were 
included in the analysis, with 41 requiring CKRT. The Random Forest and Light 
Gradient Boosting Machine exhibited the best performance, with Area Under Curve 
of Receiver Operating Characteristic Curve values of 0.905 and 0.886, 
respectively. The deep learning-based causal inference model demonstrated an 
average 7.7% increase in the probability of CKRT occurrence when administrating 
vancomycin in total data set. Additionally, that younger age, lower diastolic 
blood pressure, higher heart rate, higher baseline creatinine, and lower 
bicarbonate levels sensitized the probability of CKRT application in response to 
vancomycin treatment. Deep learning-based causal inference models showed that 
vancomycin administration increases CKRT risk, identifying specific patient 
characteristics associated with higher susceptibility.IMPORTANCEThis study 
assesses the impact of vancomycin on the risk of continuous kidney replacement 
therapy (CKRT) in intensive care unit (ICU) patients with blood culture-positive 
infections. Utilizing deep learning-based causal inference and machine learning 
models, the research quantifies how vancomycin administration increases CKRT 
risk by an average of 7.7%. Key variables influencing susceptibility include 
baseline creatinine, diastolic blood pressure, heart rate, and bicarbonate 
levels. These findings offer insights into managing vancomycin-induced kidney 
risk and may inform patient-specific treatment strategies in ICU settings.

BACKGROUND: Hyperglycemia has been reported to be associated with the outcomes 
of patients in the intensive care unit (ICU). However, the relationship between 
hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) and long-term or short-term mortality in the ICU is still 
unknown. This study used the Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care 
(MIMIC)-IV database to investigate the relationship between HbA1c and long-term 
or short-term mortality among ICU patients without a diabetes diagnosis.
METHODS: A total of 3,154 critically ill patients without a diabetes diagnosis 
who had HbA1c measurements were extracted and analyzed from the MIMIC-IV. The 
primary outcome was 1-year mortality, while the secondary outcomes were 30-day 
mortality and 90-day mortality after ICU discharge. HbA1c levels were classified 
into four levels according to three HbA1c values (5.0%, 5.7%, and 6.5%). The Cox 
regression model was used to investigate the relationship between the highest 
HbA1c measurement and mortality. Finally, this correlation was validated using 
the XGBoost machine learning model and Cox regression after propensity score 
matching (PSM).
RESULTS: The study eventually included 3,154 critically ill patients without 
diabetes who had HbA1c measurements in the database. HbA1c levels of below 5.0% 
or above 6.5% were significantly associated with 1-year mortality after 
adjusting for covariates in Cox regression (HR: 1.37; 95% CI: 1.02-1.84 or HR: 
1.62; 95% CI: 1.20-2.18). In addition, HbA1c 6.5% was linked to 30-day mortality 
(HR: 1.81; 95% CI: 1.21-2.71) and 90-day mortality (HR: 1.62; 95% CI: 
1.14-2.29). The restricted cubic spline demonstrated a U-shaped relationship 
between HbA1c levels and 1-year mortality. The AUCs of the training and testing 
datasets in the XGBoost model were 0.928 and 0.826, respectively, while the SHAP 
plot revealed that HbA1c was somewhat important for the 1-year mortality. Higher 
HbA1c levels in Cox regression were still significantly associated with 1-year 
mortality after PSM for other factors.
CONCLUSIONS: The 1-year mortality, 30-day mortality, and 90-day mortality rates 
for critically ill patients after discharge from ICU are significantly 
associated with HbA1c. HbA1c < 5.0% and ≥6.5% would increase 30-day, 90-day, and 
1-year mortality, while levels between 5.0% and 6.5% of HbA1c did not 
significantly affect these outcomes.

BACKGROUND/AIMS: Acute kidney injury (AKI) in critically ill patients is common, 
and continuous renal replacement therapy (CRRT) is a preferred mode of renal 
replacement therapy (RRT) in hemodynamically unstable patients. Prediction of 
clinical outcomes in patients on CRRT is challenging. We utilized several 
approaches to predict RRT-free survival (RRTFS) in critically ill patients with 
AKI requiring CRRT.
METHODS: We used the Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care (MIMIC-III) 
database to identify patients ≥18 years old with AKI on CRRT, after excluding 
patients who had ESRD on chronic dialysis, and kidney transplantation. We 
defined RRTFS as patients who were discharged alive and did not require RRT ≥7 
days prior to hospital discharge. We utilized all available biomedical data up 
to CRRT initiation. We evaluated 7 approaches, including logistic regression 
(LR), random forest (RF), support vector machine (SVM), adaptive boosting 
(AdaBoost), extreme gradient boosting (XGBoost), multilayer perceptron (MLP), 
and MLP with long short-term memory (MLP + LSTM). We evaluated model performance 
by using area under the receiver operating characteristic (AUROC) curves.
RESULTS: Out of 684 patients with AKI on CRRT, 205 (30%) patients had RRTFS. The 
median age of patients was 63 years and their median Simplified Acute Physiology 
Score (SAPS) II was 67 (interquartile range 52-84). The MLP + LSTM showed the 
highest AUROC (95% CI) of 0.70 (0.67-0.73), followed by MLP 0.59 (0.54-0.64), LR 
0.57 (0.52-0.62), SVM 0.51 (0.46-0.56), AdaBoost 0.51 (0.46-0.55), RF 0.44 
(0.39-0.48), and XGBoost 0.43 (CI 0.38-0.47).
CONCLUSIONS: A MLP + LSTM model outperformed other approaches for predicting 
RRTFS. Performance could be further improved by incorporating other data types.

OBJECTIVES: This study aimed to develop a prediction model for the detection of 
early sepsis-associated acute kidney injury (SA-AKI), which is defined as AKI 
diagnosed within 48 hours of a sepsis diagnosis.
DESIGN: A retrospective study design was employed. It is not linked to a 
clinical trial. Data for patients with sepsis included in the development cohort 
were extracted from the Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care IV 
(MIMIC-IV) database. The least absolute shrinkage and selection operator 
regression method was used to screen the risk factors, and the final screened 
risk factors were constructed into four machine learning models to determine an 
optimal model. External validation was performed using another single-centre 
intensive care unit (ICU) database.
SETTING: Data for the development cohort were obtained from the MIMIC-IV 2.0 
database, which is a large publicly available database that contains information 
on patients admitted to the ICUs of Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center in 
Boston, Massachusetts, USA, from 2008 to 2019. The external validation cohort 
was generated from a single-centre ICU database from China.
PARTICIPANTS: A total of 7179 critically ill patients with sepsis were included 
in the development cohort and 269 patients with sepsis were included in the 
external validation cohort.
RESULTS: A total of 12 risk factors (age, weight, atrial fibrillation, chronic 
coronary syndrome, central venous pressure, urine output, temperature, lactate, 
pH, difference in alveolar-arterial oxygen pressure, prothrombin time and 
mechanical ventilation) were included in the final prediction model. The 
gradient boosting machine model showed the best performance, and the areas under 
the receiver operating characteristic curve of the model in the development 
cohort, internal validation cohort and external validation cohort were 0.794, 
0.725 and 0.707, respectively. Additionally, to aid interpretation and clinical 
application, SHapley Additive exPlanations techniques and a web version 
calculation were applied.
CONCLUSIONS: This web-based clinical prediction model represents a reliable tool 
for predicting early SA-AKI in critically ill patients with sepsis. The model 
was externally validated using another ICU cohort and exhibited good predictive 
ability. Additional validation is needed to support the utility and 
implementation of this model.

BACKGROUND: Sepsis is one of the main causes of mortality in intensive care 
units (ICUs). Early prediction is critical for reducing injury. As approximately 
36% of sepsis occur within 24 h after emergency department (ED) admission in 
Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care (MIMIC-IV), a prediction system for 
the ED triage stage would be helpful. Previous methods such as the quick 
Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (qSOFA) are more suitable for screening than 
for prediction in the ED, and we aimed to find a light-weight, convenient 
prediction method through machine learning.
METHODS: We accessed the MIMIC-IV for sepsis patient data in the EDs. Our 
dataset comprised demographic information, vital signs, and synthetic features. 
Extreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost) was used to predict the risk of developing 
sepsis within 24 h after ED admission. Additionally, SHapley Additive 
exPlanations (SHAP) was employed to provide a comprehensive interpretation of 
the model's results. Ten percent of the patients were randomly selected as the 
testing set, while the remaining patients were used for training with 10-fold 
cross-validation.
RESULTS: For 10-fold cross-validation on 14,957 samples, we reached an accuracy 
of 84.1%±0.3% and an area under the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) 
curve of 0.92±0.02. The model achieved similar performance on the testing set of 
1,662 patients. SHAP values showed that the five most important features were 
acuity, arrival transportation, age, shock index, and respiratory rate.
CONCLUSION: Machine learning models such as XGBoost may be used for sepsis 
prediction using only a small amount of data conveniently collected in the ED 
triage stage. This may help reduce workload in the ED and warn medical workers 
against the risk of sepsis in advance.

The incidence of sepsis-induced coagulopathy (SIC) is high, leading to increased 
mortality rates and prolonged hospitalization and intensive care unit (ICU) 
stays. Early identification of SIC patients at risk of in-hospital mortality can 
improve patient prognosis. The objective of this study is to develop and 
validate machine learning (ML) models to dynamically predict in-hospital 
mortality risk in SIC patients. A ML model is established based on the Medical 
Information Mart for Intensive Care IV (MIMIC-IV) database to predict 
in-hospital mortality in SIC patients. Utilizing univariate feature selection 
for feature screening. The optimal model was determined by calculating the area 
under the curve (AUC) with a 95% confidence interval (CI). The optimal model was 
interpreted using Shapley Additive Explanation (SHAP) values. Among the 3112 SIC 
patients included in MIMIC-IV, a total of 757 (25%) patients experienced 
mortality during their ICU stay. Univariate feature selection helps us to pick 
out the 20 most critical variables from the original feature. Among the 10 
developed machine learning models, the stacking ensemble model exhibited the 
highest AUC (0.795, 95% CI: 0.763-0.827). Anion gap and age emerged as the most 
significant features for predicting the mortality risk in SIC. In this study, an 
ML model was constructed that exhibited excellent performance in predicting 
in-hospital mortality risk in SIC patients. Specifically, the stacking ensemble 
model demonstrated superior predictive ability.

BACKGROUND: Sex-stratified medicine is an important aspect of precision 
medicine. We aimed to compare the incidence and risk factors of acute kidney 
injury (AKI) for critically ill men and women with sepsis. Furthermore, the 
short-term mortality was compared between men and women with sepsis associated 
acute kidney injury (SA-AKI).
METHOD: This was a retrospective study based on the Medical Information Mart for 
Intensive Care IV database. We used the multivariable logistic regression 
analysis to evaluate the independent effect of sex on the incidence of SA-AKI. 
We further applied three machine learning methods (decision tree, random forest 
and extreme gradient boosting) to screen for the risk factors associated with 
SA-AKI in the total, men and women groups. We finally compared the intensive 
care unit (ICU) and hospital mortality between men and women with SA-AKI using 
propensity score matching.
RESULTS: A total of 6463 patients were included in our study, including 3673 men 
and 2790 women. The incidence of SA-AKI was 83.8% for men and 82.1% for women. 
After adjustment for confounders, no significant association was observed 
between sex and the incidence of SA-AKI (odds ratio (OR), 1.137; 95% confidence 
interval (CI), 0.949-1.361; p=0.163). The machine learning results revealed that 
body mass index, Oxford Acute Severity of Illness Score, diuretic, Acute 
Physiology Score III and age were the most important risk factors of SA-AKI, 
irrespective of sex. After propensity score matching, men had similar ICU and 
hospital mortality to women.
CONCLUSIONS: The incidence and associated risk factors of SA-AKI are similar 
between men and women, and men and women with SA-AKI experience comparable rates 
of ICU and hospital mortality. Therefore, sex-related effects may play a minor 
role in developing SA-AKI. Our study helps to contribute to the knowledge gap 
between sex and SA-AKI.

Machine learning (ML) is increasingly applied to predict adverse postoperative 
outcomes in cardiac surgery. Commonly used ML models fail to translate to 
clinical practice due to absent model explainability, limited uncertainty 
quantification, and no flexibility to missing data. We aimed to develop and 
benchmark a novel ML approach, the uncertainty-aware attention network (UAN), to 
overcome these common limitations. Two Bayesian uncertainty quantification 
methods were tested, generalized variational inference (GVI) or a posterior 
network (PN). The UAN models were compared with an ensemble of XGBoost models 
and a Bayesian logistic regression model (LR) with imputation. The derivation 
datasets consisted of 153,932 surgery events from the Australian and New Zealand 
Society of Cardiac and Thoracic Surgeons (ANZSCTS) Cardiac Surgery Database. An 
external validation consisted of 7343 surgery events which were extracted from 
the Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care (MIMIC) III critical care 
dataset. The highest performing model on the external validation dataset was a 
UAN-GVI with an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) of 
0.78 (0.01). Model performance improved on high confidence samples with an AUC 
of 0.81 (0.01). Confidence calibration for aleatoric uncertainty was excellent 
for all models. Calibration for epistemic uncertainty was more variable, with an 
ensemble of XGBoost models performing the best with an AUC of 0.84 (0.08). 
Epistemic uncertainty was improved using the PN approach, compared to GVI. UAN 
is able to use an interpretable and flexible deep learning approach to provide 
estimates of model uncertainty alongside state-of-the-art predictions. The model 
has been made freely available as an easy-to-use web application demonstrating 
that by designing uncertainty-aware models with innately explainable predictions 
deep learning may become more suitable for routine clinical use.

BACKGROUND: Even brief hypotension is associated with increased morbidity and 
mortality. We developed a machine learning model to predict the initial 
hypotension event among intensive care unit (ICU) patients and designed an alert 
system for bedside implementation.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: From the Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care III 
(MIMIC-3) dataset, minute-by-minute vital signs were extracted. A hypotension 
event was defined as at least five measurements within a 10-min period of 
systolic blood pressure ≤ 90 mmHg and mean arterial pressure ≤ 60 mmHg. Using 
time series data from 30-min overlapping time windows, a random forest (RF) 
classifier was used to predict risk of hypotension every minute. 
Chronologically, the first half of extracted data was used to train the model, 
and the second half was used to validate the trained model. The model's 
performance was measured with area under the receiver operating characteristic 
curve (AUROC) and area under the precision recall curve (AUPRC). Hypotension 
alerts were generated using risk score time series, a stacked RF model. A 
lockout time were applied for real-life implementation.
RESULTS: We identified 1307 subjects (1580 ICU stays) as the hypotension group 
and 1619 subjects (2279 ICU stays) as the non-hypotension group. The RF model 
showed AUROC of 0.93 and 0.88 at 15 and 60 min, respectively, before 
hypotension, and AUPRC of 0.77 at 60 min before. Risk score trajectories 
revealed 80% and > 60% of hypotension predicted at 15 and 60 min before the 
hypotension, respectively. The stacked model with 15-min lockout produced on 
average 0.79 alerts/subject/hour (sensitivity 92.4%).
CONCLUSION: Clinically significant hypotension events in the ICU can be 
predicted at least 1 h before the initial hypotension episode. With a highly 
sensitive and reliable practical alert system, a vast majority of future 
hypotension could be captured, suggesting potential real-life utility.

BACKGROUND: Accurate classification of medical records is crucial for clinical 
documentation, particularly when using the 10th revision of the International 
Classification of Diseases (ICD-10) coding system. The use of machine learning 
algorithms and Systematized Nomenclature of Medicine (SNOMED) mapping has shown 
promise in performing these classifications. However, challenges remain, 
particularly in reducing false negatives, where certain diagnoses are not 
correctly identified by either approach.
OBJECTIVE: This study explores the potential of leveraging advanced large 
language models to improve the accuracy of ICD-10 classifications in challenging 
cases of medical records where machine learning and SNOMED mapping fail.
METHODS: We evaluated the performance of ChatGPT 3.5 and ChatGPT 4 in 
classifying ICD-10 codes from discharge summaries within selected records of the 
Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care (MIMIC) IV dataset. These records 
comprised 802 discharge summaries identified as false negatives by both machine 
learning and SNOMED mapping methods, showing their challenging case. Each 
summary was assessed by ChatGPT 3.5 and 4 using a classification prompt, and the 
results were compared to human coder evaluations. Five human coders, with a 
combined experience of over 30 years, independently classified a stratified 
sample of 100 summaries to validate ChatGPT's performance.
RESULTS: ChatGPT 4 demonstrated significantly improved consistency over ChatGPT 
3.5, with matching results between runs ranging from 86% to 89%, compared to 57% 
to 67% for ChatGPT 3.5. The classification accuracy of ChatGPT 4 was variable 
across different ICD-10 codes. Overall, human coders performed better than 
ChatGPT. However, ChatGPT matched the median performance of human coders, 
achieving an accuracy rate of 22%.
CONCLUSION: This study underscores the potential of integrating advanced 
language models with clinical coding processes to improve documentation 
accuracy. ChatGPT 4 demonstrated improved consistency and comparable performance 
to median human coders, achieving 22% accuracy in challenging cases. Combining 
ChatGPT with methods like SNOMED mapping could further enhance clinical coding 
accuracy, particularly for complex scenarios.

A Large Language Model Screening Tool to Target Patients for Best Practice 
Alerts: Development and Validation.

BACKGROUND: Best Practice Alerts (BPAs) are alert messages to physicians in the 
electronic health record that are used to encourage appropriate use of health 
care resources. While these alerts are helpful in both improving care and 
reducing costs, BPAs are often broadly applied nonselectively across entire 
patient populations. The development of large language models (LLMs) provides an 
opportunity to selectively identify patients for BPAs.
OBJECTIVE: In this paper, we present an example case where an LLM screening tool 
is used to select patients appropriate for a BPA encouraging the prescription of 
deep vein thrombosis (DVT) anticoagulation prophylaxis. The artificial 
intelligence (AI) screening tool was developed to identify patients experiencing 
acute bleeding and exclude them from receiving a DVT prophylaxis BPA.
METHODS: Our AI screening tool used a BioMed-RoBERTa (Robustly Optimized 
Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers Pretraining Approach; 
AllenAI) model to perform classification of physician notes, identifying 
patients without active bleeding and thus appropriate for a thromboembolism 
prophylaxis BPA. The BioMed-RoBERTa model was fine-tuned using 500 history and 
physical notes of patients from the MIMIC-III (Medical Information Mart for 
Intensive Care) database who were not prescribed anticoagulation. A development 
set of 300 MIMIC patient notes was used to determine the model's 
hyperparameters, and a separate test set of 300 patient notes was used to 
evaluate the screening tool.
RESULTS: Our MIMIC-III test set population of 300 patients included 72 patients 
with bleeding (ie, were not appropriate for a DVT prophylaxis BPA) and 228 
without bleeding who were appropriate for a DVT prophylaxis BPA. The AI 
screening tool achieved impressive accuracy with a precision-recall area under 
the curve of 0.82 (95% CI 0.75-0.89) and a receiver operator curve area under 
the curve of 0.89 (95% CI 0.84-0.94). The screening tool reduced the number of 
patients who would trigger an alert by 20% (240 instead of 300 alerts) and 
increased alert applicability by 14.8% (218 [90.8%] positive alerts from 240 
total alerts instead of 228 [76%] positive alerts from 300 total alerts), 
compared to nonselectively sending alerts for all patients.
CONCLUSIONS: These results show a proof of concept on how language models can be 
used as a screening tool for BPAs. We provide an example AI screening tool that 
uses a HIPAA (Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act)-compliant 
BioMed-RoBERTa model deployed with minimal computing power. Larger models (eg, 
Generative Pre-trained Transformers-3, Generative Pre-trained Transformers-4, 
and Pathways Language Model) will exhibit superior performance but require data 
use agreements to be HIPAA compliant. We anticipate LLMs to revolutionize 
quality improvement in hospital medicine.

OBJECTIVE: This study aims to develop high-performing Machine Learning and Deep 
Learning models in predicting hospital length of stay (LOS) while enhancing 
interpretability. We compare performance and interpretability of models trained 
only on structured tabular data with models trained only on unstructured 
clinical text data, and on mixed data.
METHODS: The structured data was used to train fourteen classical Machine 
Learning models including advanced ensemble trees, neural networks and k-nearest 
neighbors. The unstructured data was used to fine-tune a pre-trained Bio 
Clinical BERT Transformer Deep Learning model. The structured and unstructured 
data were then merged into a tabular dataset after vectorization of the clinical 
text and a dimensional reduction through Latent Dirichlet Allocation. The study 
used the free and publicly available Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care 
(MIMIC) III database, on the open AutoML Library AutoGluon. Performance is 
evaluated with respect to two types of random classifiers, used as baselines.
RESULTS: The best model from structured data demonstrates high performance (ROC 
AUC = 0.944, PRC AUC = 0.655) with limited interpretability, where the most 
important predictors of prolonged LOS are the level of blood urea nitrogen and 
of platelets. The Transformer model displays a good but lower performance (ROC 
AUC = 0.842, PRC AUC = 0.375) with a richer array of interpretability by 
providing more specific in-hospital factors including procedures, conditions, 
and medical history. The best model trained on mixed data satisfies both a high 
level of performance (ROC AUC = 0.963, PRC AUC = 0.746) and a much larger scope 
in interpretability including pathologies of the intestine, the colon, and the 
blood; infectious diseases, respiratory problems, procedures involving sedation 
and intubation, and vascular surgery.
CONCLUSIONS: Our results outperform most of the state-of-the-art models in LOS 
prediction both in terms of performance and of interpretability. Data fusion 
between structured and unstructured text data may significantly improve 
performance and interpretability.

OBJECTIVES: To evaluate the contribution of a preextubation chest X-ray (CXR) to 
identify the risk of extubation failure in mechanically ventilated patients.
DESIGN: Retrospective cohort study.
SETTINGS: ICUs in a tertiary center (the Medical Information Mart for Intensive 
Care IV database).
PATIENTS: Patients greater than or equal to 18 years old who were mechanically 
ventilated and extubated after a spontaneous breathing trial.
INTERVENTIONS: None.
MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Among 1,066 mechanically ventilated patients, 132 
patients (12%) experienced extubation failure, defined as reintubation or death 
within 48 hours of extubation. To predict extubation failure, we developed the 
following models based on deep learning (EfficientNet) and machine learning 
(LightGBM) with the training data: 1) model using only the rapid-shallow 
breathing index (RSBI), 2) model using RSBI and CXR, 3) model using all 
candidate clinical predictors (i.e., patient demographics, vital signs, 
laboratory values, and ventilator settings) other than CXR, and 4) model using 
all candidate clinical predictors with CXR. We compared the predictive abilities 
between models with the test data to investigate the predictive contribution of 
CXR. The predictive ability of the model using CXR as well as RSBI was not 
significantly higher than that of the model using only RSBI (c-statistics, 0.56 
vs 0.56; p = 0.95). The predictive ability of the model using clinical 
predictors with CXR was not significantly higher than that of the model using 
all clinical predictors other than CXR (c-statistics, 0.71 vs 0.70; p = 0.12). 
Based on SHapley Additive exPlanations values to interpret the model using all 
clinical predictors with CXR, CXR was less likely to contribute to the 
predictive ability than other predictors (e.g., duration of mechanical 
ventilation, inability to follow commands, and heart rate).
CONCLUSIONS: Adding CXR to a set of other clinical predictors in our prediction 
model did not significantly improve the predictive ability of extubation failure 
in mechanically ventilated patients.

OBJECTIVES: We aimed to construct a mortality prediction model using the random 
forest (RF) algorithm for acute kidney injury (AKI) patients in the intensive 
care unit (ICU), and compared its performance with that of two other machine 
learning models and the customized simplified acute physiology score (SAPS) II 
model.
METHODS: We used medical information mart for intensive care (MIMIC) III 
database for model development and performance comparison. The RF model uses the 
same predictor variable set as that of the SAPS II model. We also developed 
three other models and compared the RF model with the other three models in 
prediction performance. Three other models include support vector machine (SVM) 
model, artificial neural network (ANN) model and customized SAPS II model. In 
model comparison, the prediction performance of each model was assessed by the 
Brier score, the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUROC), 
accuracy and F1 score.
RESULTS: The final cohort consisted of 19044 patients with AKI in the ICU. The 
observed in-hospital mortality of AKI patients is 13.6% in the final cohort. The 
results of model performance comparison show that the Brier score of the RF 
model is 0.085 (95%CI: 0.084-0.086) and AUROC of the RF model is 0.866 (95%CI: 
0.862-0.870). The accuracy of the RF model is 0.728 (95%CI: 0.715-0.741). The F1 
score of the RF model is 0.459 (95%CI: 0.449-0.470). The calibration plots show 
that the RF model slightly overestimates mortality in patients with low risk of 
death and underestimates mortality in patients with high risk of death.
CONCLUSION: There is great potential for the RF model in mortality prediction 
for AKI patients in ICU. The RF model may be helpful to aid ICU clinicians to 
make timely clinical intervention decisions for AKI patients, which is critical 
to help reduce the in-hospital mortality of AKI patients. A prospective study is 
necessary to evaluate the clinical utility of the RF model.

Novel Density Poincaré Plot Based Machine Learning Method to Detect Atrial 
Fibrillation From Premature Atrial/Ventricular Contractions.

Bashar SK, Han D, Zieneddin F, Ding E, Fitzgibbons TP, Walkey AJ, McManus DD, 
Javidi B, Chon KH.

OBJECTIVE: Detection of Atrial fibrillation (AF) from premature atrial 
contraction (PAC) and premature ventricular contraction (PVC) is difficult as 
frequent occurrences of these ectopic beats can mimic the typical irregular 
patterns of AF. In this paper, we present a novel density Poincaré plot-based 
machine learning method to detect AF from PAC/PVCs using electrocardiogram (ECG) 
recordings.
METHODS: First, we propose the generation of this new density Poincaré plot 
which is derived from the difference of the heart rate (DHR) and provides the 
overlapping phase-space trajectory information of the DHR. Next, from this 
density Poincaré plot, several image processing domain-based approaches 
including statistical central moments, template correlation, Zernike moment, 
discrete wavelet transform and Hough transform features are used to extract 
suitable features. Subsequently, the infinite latent feature selection algorithm 
is implemented to rank the features. Finally, classification of AF vs. PAC/PVC 
is performed using K-Nearest Neighbor, Support vector machine (SVM) and Random 
Forest (RF) classifiers. Our method is developed and validated using a subset of 
Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care (MIMIC) III database containing 10 
AF and 10 PAC/PVC subjects. Results- During the segment-wise 10-fold 
cross-validation, SVM achieved the best performance with 98.99% sensitivity, 
95.18% specificity and 97.45% accuracy with the extracted features. In 
subject-wise scenario, RF achieved the highest accuracy of 91.93%. Moreover, we 
further validated the proposed method using two other databases: wearable 
armband ECG data and the Physionet AFPDB. 100% PAC detection accuracy was 
obtained for both databases without any further training.
CONCLUSION: Our proposed density Poincaré plot-based method showed superior 
performance when compared with four existing algorithms; thus showing the 
efficacy of the extracted image domain-based features.
SIGNIFICANCE: From intensive care unit's ECG to wearable armband ECGs, the 
proposed method is shown to discriminate PAC/PVCs from AF with high accuracy.

BACKGROUND: Acute kidney injury (AKI) is a common and important complication in 
patients with gastrointestinal bleeding who are admitted to the intensive care 
unit. The present study proposes an artificial intelligence solution for acute 
kidney injury prediction in patients with gastrointestinal bleeding admitted to 
the intensive care unit.
METHODS: Data were collected from the eICU Collaborative Research Database 
(eICU-CRD) and Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care-IV (MIMIC-IV) 
database. The prediction model was developed using the extreme gradient boosting 
(XGBoost) model. The area under the receiver operating characteristic curve, 
accuracy, precision, area under the precision-recall curve (AUC-PR), and F1 
score were used to evaluate the predictive performance of each model.
RESULTS: Logistic regression, XGBoost, and XGBoost with severity scores were 
used to predict acute kidney injury risk using all features. The XGBoost-based 
acute kidney injury predictive models including XGBoost and XGBoost+severity 
scores model showed greater accuracy, recall, precision AUC, AUC-PR, and F1 
score compared to logistic regression.
CONCLUSION: The XGBoost model obtained better risk prediction for acute kidney 
injury in patients with gastrointestinal bleeding admitted to the intensive care 
unit than the traditional logistic regression model, suggesting that machine 
learning (ML) techniques have the potential to improve the development and 
validation of predictive models in patients with gastrointestinal bleeding 
admitted to the intensive care unit.

Sepsis, a syndrome with disturbed host response to severe infection, is a 
critical health problem worldwide. It is urged to develop and update novel 
therapeutic strategies for improving the outcome of sepsis. In this study, we 
demonstrated that different bacteria clustering in sepsis patients may generate 
differences of prognosis results. We extracted all the sepsis patients from 
Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care IV 2.0 (MIMIC-IV 2.0) critical care 
data set according to certain standards and clinical score, a total of 2,339 
patients were included in our study. Then we used multiple data analytics and 
machine learning methods to make all data deeply analyzed and elucidated. The 
results showed that the types of bacteria infected by patients with different 
ages, sex and race are different, the types of bacteria infected by patients 
with different SIRS values and GCS scores of the first day are different, and 
the severity of patients with different clusters is different, and most 
importantly, the survival rate of patients with different clusters also has this 
significant difference. We concluded prognostic assessment predicated by 
bacteria clustering might be a relatively potentially novel strategies and 
perspectives on prevention and management for sepsis in the future.

BACKGROUND: The Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (SOFA) score monitors organ 
failure and defines sepsis but may not fully capture factors influencing sepsis 
mortality. Socioeconomic and demographic impacts on sepsis outcomes have been 
highlighted recently.
OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the prognostic value of SOFA scores against demographic 
and social health determinants for predicting sepsis mortality in critically ill 
patients, and to assess if a combined model increases predictive accuracy.
METHODS: The study utilized retrospective data from the MIMIC-IV database and 
prospective external validation from the Penn State Health cohort. A Random 
Forest model incorporating SOFA scores, demographic/social data, and the 
Charlson Comorbidity Index was trained and validated.
FINDINGS: In the MIMIC-IV dataset of 32,970 sepsis patients, 6,824 (20.7%) died 
within 30 days. A model including demographic, socioeconomic, and comorbidity 
data with SOFA scores improved predictive accuracy beyond SOFA scores alone. Day 
2 SOFA, age, weight, and comorbidities were significant predictors. External 
validation showed consistent performance, highlighting the importance of delta 
SOFA between days 1 and 3.
CONCLUSION: Adding patient-specific demographic and socioeconomic information to 
clinical metrics significantly improves sepsis mortality prediction. This 
suggests a more comprehensive, multidimensional prognostic approach is needed 
for accurate sepsis outcome predictions.

Early Prediction of Sepsis in EMR Records Using Traditional ML Techniques and 
Deep Learning LSTM Networks.

Saqib M, Sha Y, Wang MD.

Sepsis is a life-threatening condition caused by infection and subsequent 
overreaction by the immune system. Physicians effectively treat sepsis with 
early administration of antibiotics. However, excessive use of antibiotics on 
false positive cases cultivates antibiotic resistant bacterial strains and can 
waste resources while false negative cases result in unacceptable mortality 
rates. Accurate early prediction ensures correct, early antibiotic treatment; 
unfortunately, prediction remains daunting due to error-ridden electronic 
medical records (EMRs) and the inherent complexity of sepsis. We aimed to 
predict sepsis using only the first 24 and 36 hours of lab results and vital 
signs for a patient. We used the Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care III 
(MIMIC3) dataset to test machine learning (ML) techniques including traditional 
methods (i.e., random forest (RF) and logistic regression (LR)) as well as deep 
learning techniques (i.e., long short-term memory (LSTM) neural networks). We 
successfully created a data pipeline to process and clean data, identified 
important predictive features using RF and LR techniques, and trained LSTM 
networks. We found that our best performing traditional classifier, RF, had an 
Area Under the Curve (AUC-ROC) score of 0.696, and our LSTM networks did not 
outperform RF.

OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to construct interpretable machine learning 
models to predict the risk of developing delirium in patients with sepsis and to 
explore the impact of delirium on the 28-day survival rate of patients.
METHODS: We enrolled 10,321 patients with sepsis older than eighteen years from 
the MIMIC-IV (Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care) database. Sepsis is 
defined as the presence or suspected presence of infection, along with a SOFA 
(Sequential Organ Failure Assessment) score of ≥ 2. Four machine learning 
models, namely XGBoost (extreme gradient Boost), SVM (support vector machine), 
Logistic (logistic regression) and RF (random forest), were established for 
prediction, and the prediction model was constructed.
RESULTS: A total of 10,321 sepsis patients were included, among whom 4,691 
(45.45%) developed delirium. The 28-day mortality rate was markedly elevated in 
the delirium group (log-rank P < 0.001). The XGBoost model has the best 
performance. Finally, 5 variables were selected to draw a nomogram: 
hypertension, SOFA score, chlorine, Hb (hemoglobin), creatinine. The receiver 
operating characteristic (ROC) curve of the predictive delirium model showed 
better predictive efficiency, with an AUC of 0.767 (95%CI (confidence interval): 
0.726-0.798).
CONCLUSION: The nomogram built on the XGBoost model provides clinicians with an 
easy tool to quickly assess the risk of developing delirium in patients with 
sepsis. It provides a new idea and direction for the best model to predict 
delirium in patients with sepsis, so as to promote the development of delirium 
related research.

BACKGROUND: Acute kidney injury (AKI) is a common complication in hospitalized 
older patients, associated with increased morbidity, mortality, and health care 
costs. Major adverse kidney events within 30 days (MAKE30), a composite of 
death, new renal replacement therapy, or persistent renal dysfunction, has been 
recommended as a patient-centered endpoint for clinical trials involving AKI.
OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to develop and validate a machine learning-based 
model to predict MAKE30 in hospitalized older patients with AKI.
METHODS: A total of 4266 older patients (aged ≥ 65 years) with AKI admitted to 
the Second Xiangya Hospital of Central South University from January 1, 2015, to 
December 31, 2020, were included and randomly divided into a training set and an 
internal test set in a ratio of 7:3. An additional cohort of 11,864 eligible 
patients from the Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care Ⅳ database served 
as an external test set. The Boruta algorithm was used to select the most 
important predictor variables from 53 candidate variables. The eXtreme Gradient 
Boosting algorithm was applied to establish a prediction model for MAKE30. Model 
discrimination was evaluated by the area under the receiver operating 
characteristic curve (AUROC). The SHapley Additive exPlanations method was used 
to interpret model predictions.
RESULTS: The overall incidence of MAKE30 in the 2 study cohorts was 28.3% (95% 
CI 26.9%-29.7%) and 26.7% (95% CI 25.9%-27.5%), respectively. The prediction 
model for MAKE30 exhibited adequate predictive performance, with an AUROC of 
0.868 (95% CI 0.852-0.881) in the training set and 0.823 (95% CI 0.798-0.846) in 
the internal test set. Its simplified version achieved an AUROC of 0.744 (95% CI 
0.735-0.754) in the external test set. The SHapley Additive exPlanations method 
showed that the use of vasopressors, mechanical ventilation, blood urea nitrogen 
level, red blood cell distribution width-coefficient of variation, and serum 
albumin level were closely associated with MAKE30.
CONCLUSIONS: An interpretable eXtreme Gradient Boosting model was developed and 
validated to predict MAKE30, which provides opportunities for risk 
stratification, clinical decision-making, and the conduct of clinical trials 
involving AKI.

Acute kidney injury (AKI) in critically ill patients is associated with 
significant morbidity and mortality. Development of novel methods to identify 
patients with AKI earlier will allow for testing of novel strategies to prevent 
or reduce the complications of AKI. We developed data-driven prediction models 
to estimate the risk of new AKI onset. We generated models from clinical notes 
within the first 24 hours following intensive care unit (ICU) admission 
extracted from Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care III (MIMIC-III). From 
the clinical notes, we generated clinically meaningful word and concept 
representations and embeddings, respectively. Five supervised learning 
classifiers and knowledge-guided deep learning architecture were used to 
construct prediction models. The best configuration yielded a competitive AUC of 
0.779. Our work suggests that natural language processing of clinical notes can 
be applied to assist clinicians in identifying the risk of incident AKI onset in 
critically ill patients upon admission to the ICU.

OBJECTIVE: Electronic health records (EHRs) are rich sources of patient-level 
data, offering valuable resources for medical data analysis. However, privacy 
concerns often restrict access to EHRs, hindering downstream analysis. Current 
EHR deidentification methods are flawed and can lead to potential privacy 
leakage. Additionally, existing publicly available EHR databases are limited, 
preventing the advancement of medical research using EHR. This study aims to 
overcome these challenges by generating realistic and privacy-preserving 
synthetic EHRs time series efficiently.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: We introduce a new method for generating diverse and 
realistic synthetic EHR time series data using denoizing diffusion probabilistic 
models. We conducted experiments on 6 databases: Medical Information Mart for 
Intensive Care III and IV, the eICU Collaborative Research Database (eICU), and 
non-EHR datasets on Stocks and Energy. We compared our proposed method with 8 
existing methods.
RESULTS: Our results demonstrate that our approach significantly outperforms all 
existing methods in terms of data fidelity while requiring less training effort. 
Additionally, data generated by our method yield a lower discriminative accuracy 
compared to other baseline methods, indicating the proposed method can generate 
data with less privacy risk.
DISCUSSION: The proposed model utilizes a mixed diffusion process to generate 
realistic synthetic EHR samples that protect patient privacy. This method could 
be useful in tackling data availability issues in the field of healthcare by 
reducing barrier to EHR access and supporting research in machine learning for 
health.
CONCLUSION: The proposed diffusion model-based method can reliably and 
efficiently generate synthetic EHR time series, which facilitates the downstream 
medical data analysis. Our numerical results show the superiority of the 
proposed method over all other existing methods.

IMPORTANCE: To improve patient safety, health care systems need reliable methods 
to detect adverse events in large patient populations. Events are often 
described in clinical notes, rather than structured data, which make them 
difficult to identify on a large scale.
OBJECTIVE: To develop and compare 2 natural language processing methods, a 
rules-based approach and a machine learning (ML) approach, for identifying 
bleeding events in clinical notes.
DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: This diagnostic study used deidentified notes 
from the Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care, which spans 2001 to 2012. 
A training set of 990 notes and a test set of 660 notes were randomly selected. 
Physicians classified each note as present or absent for a clinically relevant 
bleeding event during the hospitalization. A bleeding dictionary was developed 
for the rules-based approach; bleeding mentions were then aggregated to arrive 
at a classification for each note. Three ML models (support vector machine, 
extra trees, and convolutional neural network) were developed and trained using 
the 990-note training set. Another instance of each ML model was also trained on 
a sample of 450 notes, with equal numbers of bleeding-present and 
bleeding-absent notes. The notes were represented using term frequency-inverse 
document frequency vectors and global vectors for word representation.
MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: The main outcomes were accuracy, sensitivity, 
specificity, positive predictive value, and negative predictive value for each 
model. Following training, the models were tested on the test set and 
sensitivities were compared using a McNemar test.
RESULTS: The 990-note training set represented 769 patients (296 [38.5%] female; 
mean [SD] age, 67.42 [14.7] years). The 660-note test set represented 527 
patients (211 [40.0%] female; mean [SD] age, 67.86 [14.7] years). Bleeding was 
present in 146 notes (22.1%). The extra trees down-sampled model and rules-based 
approaches were similarly sensitive (93.8% vs 91.1%; difference, 2.7%; 95% CI, 
-3.8% to 7.9%; P = .44). The positive predictive value for the extra trees 
model, however, was 48.6%. The rules-based model had the best performance 
overall, with 84.6% specificity, 62.7% positive predictive value, and 97.1% 
negative predictive value.
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: Bleeding is a common complication in health care, and 
these results demonstrate an automated and scalable detection method. The 
rules-based natural language processing approach, compared with ML, had the best 
performance in identifying bleeding, with high sensitivity and negative 
predictive value.

BACKGROUND: Studies have shown that more than half of patients with heart 
failure (HF) with acute kidney injury (AKI) have newonset AKI, and renal 
function evaluation markers such as estimated glomerular filtration rate are 
usually not repeatedly tested during the hospitalization. As an independent risk 
factor, delayed AKI recognition has been shown to be associated with the adverse 
events of patients with HF, such as chronic kidney disease and death.
OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study is to develop and assess of an unsupervised 
machine learning model that identifies patients with HF and normal renal 
function but who are susceptible to de novo AKI.
METHODS: We analyzed an electronic health record data set that included 5075 
patients admitted for HF with normal renal function, from which 2 phenogroups 
were categorized using an unsupervised machine learning algorithm called K-means 
clustering. We then determined whether the inferred phenogroup index had the 
potential to be an essential risk indicator by conducting survival analysis, AKI 
prediction, and the hazard ratio test.
RESULTS: The AKI incidence rate in the generated phenogroup 2 was significantly 
higher than that in phenogroup 1 (group 1: 106/2823, 3.75%; group 2: 259/2252, 
11.50%; P<.001). The survival rate of phenogroup 2 was consistently lower than 
that of phenogroup 1 (P<.005). According to logistic regression, the univariate 
model using the phenogroup index achieved promising performance in AKI 
prediction (sensitivity 0.710). The generated phenogroup index was also 
significant in serving as a risk indicator for AKI (hazard ratio 3.20, 95% CI 
2.55-4.01). Consistent results were yielded by applying the proposed model on an 
external validation data set extracted from Medical Information Mart for 
Intensive Care (MIMIC) III pertaining to 1006 patients with HF and normal renal 
function.
CONCLUSIONS: According to a machine learning analysis on electronic health 
record data, patients with HF who had normal renal function were clustered into 
separate phenogroups associated with different risk levels of de novo AKI. Our 
investigation suggests that using machine learning can facilitate patient 
phengrouping and stratification in clinical settings where the identification of 
high-risk patients has been challenging.

Exponential growth of biomedical literature and clinical data demands more 
robust yet precise computational methodologies to extract useful insights from 
biomedical literature and to perform accurate assignment of disease-specific 
codes. Such approaches can largely enhance the effectiveness of diverse 
biomedicine and bioinformatics applications. State-of-the-art computational 
biomedical text classification methodologies either solely leverage 
discrimintaive features extracted through convolution operations performed by 
deep convolutional neural network or contextual information extracted by 
recurrent neural network. However, none of the methodology takes advantage of 
both convolutional and recurrent neural networks. Further, existing 
methodologies lack to produce decent performance for the classification of 
different genre biomedical text such as biomedical literature or clinical notes. 
We, for the very first time, present a generic deep learning based hybrid 
multi-label classification methodology namely GHS-NET which can be utilized to 
accurately classify biomedical text of diverse genre. GHS-NET makes use of 
convolutional neural network to extract most discriminative features and 
bi-directional Long Short-Term Memory to acquire contextual information. GHS-NET 
effectiveness is evaluated for extreme multi-label biomedical literature 
classification and assignment of ICD-9 codes to clinical notes. For the task of 
extreme multi-label biomedical literature classification, performance comparison 
of GHS-Net and state-of-the-art deep learning based methodology reveals that 
GHS-Net marks the increment of 1%, 6%, and 1% for hallmarks of cancer dataset, 
10%, 16%, and 11% for chemical exposure dataset in terms of precision, recall, 
and F1-score. For the task of clinical notes classification, GHS-Net outperforms 
previous best deep learning based methodology over Medical Information Mart for 
Intensive Care dataset (MIMIC-III) by the significant margin of 6%, 8% in terms 
of recall and F1-score. GHS-NET is available as a web service at1 and 
potentially can be used to accurately classify multi-variate disease and 
chemical exposure specific text.

BACKGROUND: Medical image analysis, particularly in the context of visual 
question answering (VQA) and image captioning, is crucial for accurate diagnosis 
and educational purposes.
OBJECTIVE: Our study aims to introduce BioMedBLIP models, fine-tuned for VQA 
tasks using specialized medical data sets such as Radiology Objects in Context 
and Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care-Chest X-ray, and evaluate their 
performance in comparison to the state of the art (SOTA) original Bootstrapping 
Language-Image Pretraining (BLIP) model.
METHODS: We present 9 versions of BioMedBLIP across 3 downstream tasks in 
various data sets. The models are trained on a varying number of epochs. The 
findings indicate the strong overall performance of our models. We proposed 
BioMedBLIP for the VQA generation model, VQA classification model, and 
BioMedBLIP image caption model. We conducted pretraining in BLIP using medical 
data sets, producing an adapted BLIP model tailored for medical applications.
RESULTS: In VQA generation tasks, BioMedBLIP models outperformed the SOTA on the 
Semantically-Labeled Knowledge-Enhanced (SLAKE) data set, VQA in Radiology 
(VQA-RAD), and Image Cross-Language Evaluation Forum data sets. In VQA 
classification, our models consistently surpassed the SOTA on the SLAKE data 
set. Our models also showed competitive performance on the VQA-RAD and PathVQA 
data sets. Similarly, in image captioning tasks, our model beat the SOTA, 
suggesting the importance of pretraining with medical data sets. Overall, in 20 
different data sets and task combinations, our BioMedBLIP excelled in 15 (75%) 
out of 20 tasks. BioMedBLIP represents a new SOTA in 15 (75%) out of 20 tasks, 
and our responses were rated higher in all 20 tasks (P<.005) in comparison to 
SOTA models.
CONCLUSIONS: Our BioMedBLIP models show promising performance and suggest that 
incorporating medical knowledge through pretraining with domain-specific medical 
data sets helps models achieve higher performance. Our models thus demonstrate 
their potential to advance medical image analysis, impacting diagnosis, medical 
education, and research. However, data quality, task-specific variability, 
computational resources, and ethical considerations should be carefully 
addressed. In conclusion, our models represent a contribution toward the synergy 
of artificial intelligence and medicine. We have made BioMedBLIP freely 
available, which will help in further advancing research in multimodal medical 
tasks.

BACKGROUND: Increased chloride in the context of intravenous fluid chloride load 
and serum chloride levels (hyperchloremia) have previously been associated with 
increased morbidity and mortality in select subpopulations of intensive care 
unit (ICU) patients (e.g patients with sepsis). Here, we study the general ICU 
population of the Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care III (MIMIC-III) 
database to corroborate these associations, and propose a supervised learning 
model for the prediction of hyperchloremia in ICU patients.
METHODS: We assessed hyperchloremia and chloride load and their associations 
with several outcomes (ICU mortality, new acute kidney injury [AKI] by day 7, 
and multiple organ dysfunction syndrome [MODS] on day 7) using regression 
analysis. Four predictive supervised learning classifiers were trained to 
predict hyperchloremia using features representative of clinical records from 
the first 24h of adult ICU stays.
RESULTS: Hyperchloremia was shown to have an independent association with 
increased odds of ICU mortality, new AKI by day 7, and MODS on day 7. High 
chloride load was also associated with increased odds of ICU mortality. Our best 
performing supervised learning model predicted second-day hyperchloremia with an 
AUC of 0.76 and a number needed to alert (NNA) of 7-a clinically-actionable 
rate.
CONCLUSIONS: Our results support the use of predictive models to aid clinicians 
in monitoring for and preventing hyperchloremia in high-risk patients and offers 
an opportunity to improve patient outcomes.

OBJECTIVES: Establishing confidence in the safety of Artificial Intelligence 
(AI)-based clinical decision support systems is important prior to clinical 
deployment and regulatory approval for systems with increasing autonomy. Here, 
we undertook safety assurance of the AI Clinician, a previously published 
reinforcement learning-based treatment recommendation system for sepsis.
METHODS: As part of the safety assurance, we defined four clinical hazards in 
sepsis resuscitation based on clinical expert opinion and the existing 
literature. We then identified a set of unsafe scenarios, intended to limit the 
action space of the AI agent with the goal of reducing the likelihood of 
hazardous decisions.
RESULTS: Using a subset of the Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care 
(MIMIC-III) database, we demonstrated that our previously published 'AI 
clinician' recommended fewer hazardous decisions than human clinicians in three 
out of our four predefined clinical scenarios, while the difference was not 
statistically significant in the fourth scenario. Then, we modified the reward 
function to satisfy our safety constraints and trained a new AI Clinician agent. 
The retrained model shows enhanced safety, without negatively impacting model 
performance.
DISCUSSION: While some contextual patient information absent from the data may 
have pushed human clinicians to take hazardous actions, the data were curated to 
limit the impact of this confounder.
CONCLUSION: These advances provide a use case for the systematic safety 
assurance of AI-based clinical systems towards the generation of explicit safety 
evidence, which could be replicated for other AI applications or other clinical 
contexts, and inform medical device regulatory bodies.

Background: Hypertension is a rather common comorbidity among critically ill 
patients and hospital mortality might be higher among critically ill patients 
with hypertension (SBP ≥ 140 mmHg and/or DBP ≥ 90 mmHg). This study aimed to 
explore the association between ACEI/ARB medication during ICU stay and 
all-cause in-hospital mortality in these patients. Methods: A retrospective 
cohort study was conducted based on data from Medical Information Mart for 
Intensive Care IV (MIMIC-IV) database, which consisted of more than 40,000 
patients in ICU between 2008 and 2019 at Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center. 
Adults diagnosed with hypertension on admission and those had high blood 
pressure (SBP ≥ 140 mmHg and/or DBP ≥ 90 mmHg) during ICU stay were included. 
The primary outcome was all-cause in-hospital mortality. Patients were divided 
into ACEI/ARB treated and non-treated group during ICU stay. Propensity score 
matching (PSM) was used to adjust potential confounders. Nine machine learning 
models were developed and validated based on 37 clinical and laboratory features 
of all patients. The model with the best performance was selected based on area 
under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) followed by 5-fold 
cross-validation. After hyperparameter optimization using Grid and random 
hyperparameter search, a final LightGBM model was developed, and Shapley 
Additive exPlanations (SHAP) values were calculated to evaluate feature 
importance of each feature. The features closely associated with hospital 
mortality were presented as significant features. Results: A total of 15,352 
patients were enrolled in this study, among whom 5,193 (33.8%) patients were 
treated with ACEI/ARB. A significantly lower all-cause in-hospital mortality was 
observed among patients treated with ACEI/ARB (3.9 vs. 12.7%) as well as a lower 
28-day mortality (3.6 vs. 12.2%). The outcome remained consistent after 
propensity score matching. Among nine machine learning models, the LightGBM 
model had the highest AUC = 0.9935. The SHAP plot was employed to make the model 
interpretable based on LightGBM model after hyperparameter optimization, showing 
that ACEI/ARB use was among the top five significant features, which were 
associated with hospital mortality. Conclusions: The use of ACEI/ARB in 
critically ill patients with hypertension during ICU stay is related to lower 
all-cause in-hospital mortality, which was independently associated with 
increased survival in a large and heterogeneous cohort of critically ill 
hypertensive patients with or without kidney dysfunction.

Weaning patients from mechanical ventilation (MV) is a critical and resource 
intensive process in the Intensive Care Unit (ICU) that impacts patient outcomes 
and healthcare expenses. Weaning methods vary widely among providers. Prolonged 
MV is associated with adverse events and higher healthcare expenses. Predicting 
weaning readiness is a non-trivial process in which the positive end-expiratory 
pressure (PEEP), a crucial component of MV, has potential to be indicative but 
has not yet been used as the target. We aimed to predict successful weaning from 
mechanical ventilation by targeting changes in the PEEP-level using a supervised 
machine learning model. This retrospective study included 12,153 mechanically 
ventilated patients from Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care (MIMIC-IV) 
and eICU collaborative research database (eICU-CRD). Two machine learning models 
(Extreme Gradient Boosting and Logistic Regression) were developed using a 
continuous PEEP reduction as target. The data is splitted into 80% as training 
set and 20% as test set. The model's predictive performance was reported using 
95% confidence interval (CI), based on evaluation metrics such as area under the 
receiver operating characteristic (AUROC), area under the precision-recall curve 
(AUPRC), F1-Score, Recall, positive predictive value (PPV), and negative 
predictive value (NPV). The model's descriptive performance was reported as the 
variable ranking using SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations) algorithm. The best 
model achieved an AUROC of 0.84 (95% CI 0.83-0.85) and an AUPRC of 0.69 (95% CI 
0.67-0.70) in predicting successful weaning based on the PEEP reduction. The 
model demonstrated a Recall of 0.85 (95% CI 0.84-0.86), F1-score of 0.86 (95% CI 
0.85-0.87), PPV of 0.87 (95% CI 0.86-0.88), and NPV of 0.64 (95% CI 0.63-0.66). 
Most of the variables that SHAP algorithm ranked to be important correspond with 
clinical intuition, such as duration of MV, oxygen saturation (SaO2), PEEP, and 
Glasgow Coma Score (GCS) components. This study demonstrates the potential 
application of machine learning in predicting successful weaning from MV based 
on continuous PEEP reduction. The model's high PPV and moderate NPV suggest that 
it could be a useful tool to assist clinicians in making decisions regarding 
ventilator management.

The increasing accumulation of healthcare data provides researchers with ample 
opportunities to build machine learning approaches for clinical decision support 
and to improve the quality of health care. Several studies have developed 
conventional machine learning approaches that rely heavily on manual feature 
engineering and result in task-specific models for health care. In contrast, 
healthcare researchers have begun to use deep learning, which has emerged as a 
revolutionary machine learning technique that obviates manual feature 
engineering but still achieves impressive results in research fields such as 
image classification. However, few of them have addressed the lack of the 
interpretability of deep learning models although interpretability is essential 
for the successful adoption of machine learning approaches by healthcare 
communities. In addition, the unique characteristics of healthcare data such as 
high dimensionality and temporal dependencies pose challenges for building 
models on healthcare data. To address these challenges, we develop a gated 
recurrent unit-based recurrent neural network with hierarchical attention for 
mortality prediction, and then, using the diagnostic codes from the Medical 
Information Mart for Intensive Care, we evaluate the model. We find that the 
prediction accuracy of the model outperforms baseline models and demonstrate the 
interpretability of the model in visualizations.

BACKGROUND: The data missing from patient profiles in intensive care units 
(ICUs) are substantial and unavoidable. However, this incompleteness is not 
always random or because of imperfections in the data collection process.
OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to investigate the potential hidden information in 
data missing from electronic health records (EHRs) in an ICU and examine whether 
the presence or missingness of a variable itself can convey information about 
the patient health status.
METHODS: Daily retrieval of laboratory test (LT) measurements from the Medical 
Information Mart for Intensive Care III database was set as our reference for 
defining complete patient profiles. Missingness indicators were introduced as a 
way of representing presence or absence of the LTs in a patient profile. 
Thereafter, various feature selection methods (filter and embedded feature 
selection methods) were used to examine the predictive power of missingness 
indicators. Finally, a set of well-known prediction models (logistic regression 
[LR], decision tree, and random forest) were used to evaluate whether the 
absence status itself of a variable recording can provide predictive power. We 
also examined the utility of missingness indicators in improving predictive 
performance when used with observed laboratory measurements as model input. The 
outcome of interest was in-hospital mortality and mortality at 30 days after ICU 
discharge.
RESULTS: Regardless of mortality type or ICU day, more than 40% of the 
predictors selected by feature selection methods were missingness indicators. 
Notably, employing missingness indicators as the only predictors achieved 
reasonable mortality prediction on all days and for all mortality types (for 
instance, in 30-day mortality prediction with LR, we achieved area under the 
curve of the receiver operating characteristic [AUROC] of 0.6836±0.012). 
Including indicators with observed measurements in the prediction models also 
improved the AUROC; the maximum improvement was 0.0426. Indicators also improved 
the AUROC for Simplified Acute Physiology Score II model-a well-known ICU 
severity of illness score-confirming the additive information of the indicators 
(AUROC of 0.8045±0.0109 for 30-day mortality prediction for LR).
CONCLUSIONS: Our study demonstrated that the presence or absence of LT 
measurements is informative and can be considered a potential predictor of 
in-hospital and 30-day mortality. The comparative analysis of prediction models 
also showed statistically significant prediction improvement when indicators 
were included. Moreover, missing data might reflect the opinions of examining 
clinicians. Therefore, the absence of measurements can be informative in ICUs 
and has predictive power beyond the measured data themselves. This initial case 
study shows promise for more in-depth analysis of missing data and its 
informativeness in ICUs. Future studies are needed to generalize these results.

BACKGROUND: Sepsis-associated thrombocytopenia (SAT) is common in critical 
patients and results in the elevation of mortality. Red cell distribution width 
(RDW) can reflect body response to inflammation and oxidative stress. We try to 
investigate the relationship between the RDW and the prognosis of patients with 
SAT through machine learning.
METHODS: 809 patients were retrospectively analyzed from the Medical Information 
Mart for Intensive Care III (MIMIC-III) database. The eXtreme Gradient Boosting 
(XGBoost) and SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) were used to analyze the 
impact of each feature. Logistic regression analysis, propensity score matching 
(PSM), receiver-operating characteristics (ROC) curve analysis, and the 
Kaplan-Meier method were used for data processing.
RESULTS: The patients with thrombocytopenia had higher 28-day mortality (48.2%). 
Machine learning indicated that RDW was the second most important in predicting 
28-day mortality. The RDW was significantly increased in non-survivors by 
logistic regression and PSM. ROC curve shows that RDW has moderate predictive 
power for 28-day mortality. The patients with RDW>16.05 exhibited higher 
mortality through Kaplan-Meier analysis.
CONCLUSIONS: Interpretable machine learning can be applied in clinical research. 
Elevated RDW is not only common in patients with SAT but is also associated with 
a poor prognosis.

BACKGROUND: Rich data in cardiovascular diagnostic testing are often sequestered 
in unstructured reports, with the necessity of manual abstraction limiting their 
use in real-time applications in patient care and research.
METHODS: We developed a two-step process that sequentially deploys generative 
and interpretative large language models (LLMs; Llama2 70b and Llama2 13b). 
Using a Llama2 70b model, we generated varying formats of transthoracic 
echocardiogram (TTE) reports from 3,000 real-world echo reports with paired 
structured elements, leveraging temporal changes in reporting formats to define 
the variations. Subsequently, we fine-tuned Llama2 13b using sequentially larger 
batches of generated echo reports as inputs, to extract data from free-text 
narratives across 18 clinically relevant echocardiographic fields. This was set 
up as a prompt-based supervised training task. We evaluated the fine-tuned 
Llama2 13b model, HeartDx-LM, on several distinct echocardiographic datasets: 
(i) reports across the different time periods and formats at Yale New Haven 
Health System (YNHHS), (ii) the Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care 
(MIMIC) III dataset, and (iii) the MIMIC IV dataset. We used the accuracy of 
extracted fields and Cohen's Kappa as the metrics and have publicly released the 
HeartDX-LM model.
RESULTS: The HeartDX-LM model was trained on randomly selected 2,000 synthetic 
echo reports with varying formats and paired structured labels, with a wide 
range of clinical findings. We identified a lower threshold of 500 annotated 
reports required for fine-tuning Llama2 13b to achieve stable and consistent 
performance. At YNHHS, the HeartDx-LM model accurately extracted 69,144 out of 
70,032 values (98.7%) across 18 clinical fields from unstructured reports in the 
test set from contemporary records where paired structured data were also 
available. In older echo reports where only unstructured reports were available, 
the model achieved 87.1% accuracy against expert annotations for the same 18 
fields for a random sample of 100 reports. Similarly, in expert-annotated 
external validation sets from MIMIC-IV and MIMIC-III, HeartDx-LM correctly 
extracted 201 out of 220 available values (91.3%) and 615 out of 707 available 
values (87.9%), respectively, from 100 randomly chosen and expert annotated echo 
reports from each set.
CONCLUSION: We developed a novel method using paired large and moderate-sized 
LLMs to automate the extraction of unstructured echocardiographic reports into 
tabular datasets. Our approach represents a scalable strategy that transforms 
unstructured reports into computable elements that can be leveraged to improve 
cardiovascular care quality and enable research.

PURPOSE: Appropriate opioid management is crucial to reduce opioid overdose risk 
for ICU surgical patients, which can lead to severe complications. Accurately 
predicting postoperative opioid needs and understanding the associated factors 
can effectively guide appropriate opioid use, significantly enhancing patient 
safety and recovery outcomes. Although machine learning models can accurately 
predict postoperative opioid needs, lacking interpretability hinders their 
adoption in clinical practice.
METHODS: We developed an interpretable deep learning framework to evaluate 
individual feature's impact on postoperative opioid use and identify important 
factors. A Permutation Feature Importance Test (PermFIT) was employed to assess 
the impact with a rigorous statistical inference for machine learning models 
including Support Vector Machines, eXtreme Gradient Boosting, Random Forest, and 
Deep Neural Networks (DNN). The Mean Squared Error (MSE) and Pearson Correlation 
Coefficient (PCC) were used to evaluate the performance of these models.
RESULTS: We conducted analysis utilizing the electronic health records of 4,912 
surgical patients from the Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care database. 
In a 10-fold cross-validation, the DNN outperformed other machine learning 
models, achieving the lowest MSE (7889.2 mcg) and highest PCC (0.283). Among 25 
features, 13-including age, surgery type, and others-were identified as 
significant predictors of postoperative opioid use (p < 0.05).
CONCLUSION: The DNN proved to be an effective model for predicting postoperative 
opioid consumption and identifying significant features through the PermFIT 
framework. This approach offers a valuable tool for precise opioid prescription 
tailored to the individual needs of ICU surgical patients, improving patient 
outcomes and enhancing safety.

Background: Sepsis-induced coagulopathy (SIC) is a common cause for inducing 
poor prognosis of critically ill patients in intensive care unit (ICU). However, 
currently there are no tools specifically designed for assessing short-term 
mortality in SIC patients. This study aimed to develop a practical nomogram to 
predict the risk of 28-day mortality in SIC patients. Methods: In this 
retrospective cohort study, we extracted patients from the Medical Information 
Mart for Intensive Care III (MIMIC-III) database. Sepsis was defined based on 
Sepsis 3.0 criteria and SIC based on Toshiaki Iba's criteria. Kaplan-Meier 
curves were plotted to compare the short survival time between SIC and non-SIC 
patients. Afterward, only SIC cohort was randomly divided into training or 
validation set. We employed univariate logistic regression and stepwise 
multivariate analysis to select predictive features. The proposed nomogram was 
developed based on multivariate logistic regression model, and the 
discrimination and calibration were verified by internal validation. We then 
compared model discrimination with other traditional severity scores and machine 
learning models. Results: 9432 sepsis patients in MIMIC III were enrolled, in 
which 3280 (34.8%) patients were diagnosed as SIC during the first ICU 
admission. SIC was independently associated with the 7- and 28-day mortality of 
ICU patients. K-M curve indicated a significant difference in 7-day (Log-Rank: P 
< 0.001 and P = 0.017) and 28-day survival (Log-Rank: P < 0.001 and P < 0.001) 
between SIC and non-SIC groups whether the propensity score match (PSM) was 
balanced or not. For nomogram development, a total of thirteen variables of 
3,280 SIC patients were enrolled. When predicted the risk of 28-day mortality, 
the nomogram performed a good discrimination in training and validation sets 
(AUROC: 0.78 and 0.81). The AUROC values were 0.80, 0.81, 0.71, 0.70, 0.74, and 
0.60 for random forest, support vector machine, sequential organ failure 
assessment (SOFA) score, logistic organ dysfunction score (LODS), simplified 
acute physiology II score (SAPS II) and SIC score, respectively, in validation 
set. And the nomogram calibration slope was 0.91, the Brier value was 0.15. As 
presented by the decision curve analyses, the nomogram always obtained more net 
benefit when compared with other severity scores. Conclusions: SIC is 
independently related to the short-term mortality of ICU patients. The nomogram 
achieved an optimal prediction of 28-day mortality in SIC patient, which can 
lead to a better prognostics assessment. However, the discriminative ability of 
the nomogram requires validation in external cohorts to further improve 
generalizability.

Chronic Kidney Disease (CKD) is a significant problem in today's healthcare 
since it is challenging to detect until it has improved significantly, which 
increases medical expenses. If CKD was detected early, the patient might qualify 
for more effective treatment and prevent the disease from spreading further. 
Presently, existing methods that effectively detect CKD cannot detect symptoms 
early on. This problem motivates researchers to work on a predictive model that 
successfully detects disease symptoms in the early stages. This study introduces 
a novel Adaptive Particle Swarm Optimization (APSO)-optimized Echo State Network 
(ESN) model designed to overcome key limitations of existing methods. ESNs, 
while effective in processing temporal sequences, are highly sensitive to 
hyperparameter settings such as spectral radius, input scaling, and sparsity, 
which directly impact stability, memory retention, and predictive Classification 
Accuracy (CA). To address this, APSO optimizes these hyperparameters 
dynamically, ensuring a balanced trade-off between stability and computational 
efficiency. Moreover, Random Matrix Theory (RMT) is integrated into APSO to 
regulate the spectral radius, enhancing the ESN's capability to handle long-term 
dependencies while maintaining stability in training. This investigation 
exploited the Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care-III (MIMIC-III) 
dataset to train the model they developed. The proposed method employs this data 
collection to analyze the highly complex temporal sequences signifying CKD is 
present. The hyperparameters of the ESN, such as the range of the spectral 
region and the input data sizing, can be optimized in real-time with APSO by 
applying Random Matrix Theory (RMT). Compared with different recognized models, 
such as conventional ESN and standard M, the recommended APSO + ESN proved to 
have higher CA in medical investigations. The APSO + ESN improved the subsequent 
highest-performing model by 2% in recall and 3% in precision and attained a CA 
of 99.6%.

Sepsis related acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) is a common and 
serious disease in clinic. Accurate prediction of in-hospital mortality of 
patients is crucial to optimize treatment and improve prognosis under the new 
global definition of ARDS. Our study aimed to use machine learning models to 
develop models that can effectively predict the in-hospital mortality of 
patients with sepsis related ARDS, calculate the mortality, and to identify 
related risk factors under the new global definition of ARDS. Based on MIMIC 
database, our study included 3470 first-time admission records of patients with 
sepsis related ARDS. After excluding 4 patients under the age of 18, 75 patients 
with less than 24 h stay in ICU, and 5 cases with missing indicators > 30%, 
finally 3386 cases were retained. The variance inflation factor (VIF) analysis 
was used to test the collinearity of the explanatory variables. The data were 
divided into the training set and the test set according to the ratio of 7:3. 
Six models, extreme gradient boosting (XGBoost), light gradient boosting 
(LightGBM), random forest (RF), classification and regression tree (CART), naive 
bayes (NB) and logistic regression (LR), were designed for training and testing. 
In the training set, XGBoost (AUROC = 0.951, 95% CI 0.942-0.961), LR 
(AUROC = 0.835, 95% CI 0.817-0.854), RF (AUROC = 1.0, 95% CI 1.0-1.0), LightGBM 
(AUROC = 1.0, 95% CI 1.0-1.0), CART (AUROC = 0.831, 95% CI 0.811-0.852), NB 
(AUROC = 0.793, 95% CI 0.772-0.814). In the test set, XGBoost (AUROC = 0.833, 
95% CI 0.804-0.861), LR (AUROC = 0.82695% CI 0.796-0.856), RF (AUROC = 0.846, 
95% CI 0.818-0.874), LightGBM (AUROC = 0.827, 95% CI 0.798-0.856), CART 
(AUROC = 0.753, 95% CI 0.718-0.787), NB (AUROC = 0.799, 95% CI 0.768-0.831). The 
RF model has the best performance on the test set. Further analyze the feature 
importance ranking and partial dependence plots of random forest model. Acute 
physiology and chronic health evaluation III (APACHE III), bicarbonate, anion 
gap and non-invasive blood pressure systolic were identified as the four most 
important risk characteristics. In this study, a variety of machine learning 
models have been successfully constructed to predict the in-hospital mortality 
of patients with sepsis related ARDS, among which the RF model performs well. 
Key risk factors identified include APACHE III, bicarbonate, anion gap and 
non-invasive blood pressure systolic. The identification of these factors helps 
clinicians to assess patients' conditions more accurately and develop 
personalized treatment plans, thereby improving the survival rate and prognosis 
quality of patients under the new global definition of ARDS.

BACKGROUND: Acute hypotensive episodes (AHE), defined as a drop in the mean 
arterial pressure (MAP) <65 mm Hg lasting at least 5 consecutive minutes, are 
among the most critical events in the intensive care unit (ICU). They are known 
to be associated with adverse outcome in critically ill patients. AHE prediction 
is of prime interest because it could allow for treatment adjustment to predict 
or shorten AHE.
METHODS: The Super Learner (SL) algorithm is an ensemble machine-learning 
algorithm that we specifically trained to predict an AHE 10 minutes in advance. 
Potential predictors included age, sex, type of care unit, severity scores, and 
time-evolving characteristics such as mechanical ventilation, vasopressors, or 
sedation medication as well as features extracted from physiological signals: 
heart rate, pulse oximetry, and arterial blood pressure. The algorithm was 
trained on the Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care dataset (MIMIC II) 
database. Internal validation was based on the area under the receiver operating 
characteristic curve (AUROC) and the Brier score (BS). External validation was 
performed using an external dataset from Lariboisière hospital, Paris, France.
RESULTS: Among 1151 patients included, 826 (72%) patients had at least 1 AHE 
during their ICU stay. Using 1 single random period per patient, the SL 
algorithm with Haar wavelets transform preprocessing was associated with an 
AUROC of 0.929 (95% confidence interval [CI], 0.899-0.958) and a BS of 0.08. 
Using all available periods for each patient, SL with Haar wavelets transform 
preprocessing was associated with an AUROC of 0.890 (95% CI, 0.886-0.895) and a 
BS of 0.11. In the external validation cohort, the AUROC reached 0.884 (95% CI, 
0.775-0.993) with 1 random period per patient and 0.889 (0.768-1) with all 
available periods and BSs <0.1.
CONCLUSIONS: The SL algorithm exhibits good performance for the prediction of an 
AHE 10 minutes ahead of time. It allows an efficient, robust, and rapid 
evaluation of the risk of hypotension that opens the way to routine use.

Chest imaging plays a pivotal role in screening and monitoring patients, and 
various predictive artificial intelligence (AI) models have been developed in 
support of this. However, little is known about the effect of decreasing the 
radiation dose and, thus, image quality on AI performance. This study aims to 
design a low-dose simulation and evaluate the effect of this simulation on the 
performance of CNNs in plain chest radiography. Seven pathology labels and 
corresponding images from Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care datasets 
were used to train AI models at two spatial resolutions. These 14 models were 
tested using the original images, 50% and 75% low-dose simulations. We compared 
the area under the receiver operator characteristic (AUROC) of the original 
images and both simulations using DeLong testing. The average absolute change in 
AUROC related to simulated dose reduction for both resolutions was <0.005, and 
none exceeded a change of 0.014. Of the 28 test sets, 6 were significantly 
different. An assessment of predictions, performed through the splitting of the 
data by gender and patient positioning, showed a similar trend. The effect of 
simulated dose reductions on CNN performance, although significant in 6 of 28 
cases, has minimal clinical impact. The effect of patient positioning exceeds 
that of dose reduction.

BACKGROUND: Multiple organ dysfunction syndrome (MODS) is a critical 
complication in trauma-induced sepsis patients and is associated with a high 
mortality rate. This study aimed to develop and validate predictive models for 
MODS in this patient population using a nomogram and machine learning 
approaches.
METHODS: This retrospective cohort study utilized data from the Medical 
Information Mart for Intensive Care-IV 2.2 database, focusing on trauma patients 
diagnosed with sepsis within the first day of intensive care unit (ICU) 
admission. Predictive variables were extracted from the initial 24 h of ICU 
data. The dataset (2008-2019) was divided into a training set (2008-2016) and a 
temporal validation set (2017-2019). Feature selection was conducted using the 
Boruta algorithm. Predictive models were developed and validated using a 
nomogram and various machine learning techniques. Model performance was 
evaluated based on discrimination, calibration, and decision curve analysis.
RESULTS: Among 1295 trauma patients with sepsis, 349 (26.95%) developed MODS. 
The 28-day mortality rates were 11.21% for non-MODS patients and 23.82% for MODS 
patients. Key predictors of MODS included the simplified acute physiology score 
II score, use of mechanical ventilation, and vasopressor administration. In 
temporal validation, all models significantly outperformed traditional scoring 
systems (all P <0.05). The nomogram achieved an area under the curve (AUC) of 
0.757 (95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.700 to 0.814), while the random forest 
model demonstrated the highest performance with an AUC of 0.769 (95% CI: 0.712 
to 0.826). Calibration plots showed excellent agreement between predicted and 
observed probabilities, and decision curve analysis indicated a consistently 
higher net benefit for the newly developed models.
CONCLUSION: The nomogram and machine learning models provide enhanced predictive 
accuracy for MODS in trauma-induced sepsis patients compared to traditional 
scoring systems. These tools, accessible via web-based applications, have the 
potential to improve early risk stratification and guide clinical 
decision-making, ultimately enhancing outcomes for trauma patients. Further 
external validation is recommended to confirm their generalizability.

Adhering to bundle-based care recommendations within stringent time constraints 
presents a profound challenge. Elements within these bundles hold varying 
degrees of significance. We aimed to evaluate the Surviving Sepsis Campaign 
(SSC) hour-one bundle compliance patterns and their association with patient 
outcomes. Utilizing the Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care-IV 1.0 
dataset, this retrospective cohort study evaluated patients with sepsis who 
developed shock and were admitted to the intensive care unit between 2008 and 
2019. The execution of five hour-one bundle interventions were assessed. 
Patients with similar treatment profiles were categorized into clusters using 
unsupervised machine learning. Primary outcomes included in-hospital and 1-year 
mortality. Four clusters were identified: C#0 (n = 4716) had the poorest bundle 
compliance. C#1 (n = 1117) had perfect antibiotic adherence with modest fluid 
and serum lactate measurement adherence. C#2 (n = 850) exhibited full adherence 
to lactate measurement and low adherence to fluid administration, blood culture, 
and vasopressors, while C#3 (n = 381) achieved complete adherence to fluid 
administration and the highest adherence to vasopressor requirements in the 
entire cohort. Adjusting for covariates, C#1 and C#3 were associated with 
reduced odds of in-hospital mortality compared to C#0 (adjusted odds ratio 
[aOR] = 0·83; 95% confidence interval [CI] 0·7-0·97 and aOR = 0·7; 95% CI 
0·53-0·91, respectively). C#1 exhibited significantly better 1-year survival 
(adjusted hazard ratio [aHR] = 0·9; 95%CI 0·81-0·99). We were able to identify 
distinct clusters of SSC hour-one bundle adherence patterns using unsupervised 
machine learning techniques, which were associated with patient outcomes.

AIMS: ICD codes are used for classification of hospitalizations. The codes are 
used for administrative, financial, and research purposes. It is known, however, 
that errors occur. Natural language processing (NLP) offers promising solutions 
for optimizing the process. To investigate methods for automatic classification 
of disease in unstructured medical records using NLP and to compare these to 
conventional ICD coding.
METHODS AND RESULTS: Two datasets were used: the open-source Medical Information 
Mart for Intensive Care (MIMIC)-III dataset (n = 55.177) and a dataset from a 
hospital in Belgium (n = 12.706). Automated searches using NLP algorithms were 
performed for the diagnoses 'atrial fibrillation (AF)' and 'heart failure (HF)'. 
Four methods were used: rule-based search, logistic regression, term 
frequency-inverse document frequency (TF-IDF), Extreme Gradient Boosting 
(XGBoost), and Bio-Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers 
(BioBERT). All algorithms were developed on the MIMIC-III dataset. The best 
performing algorithm was then deployed on the Belgian dataset. After 
preprocessing a total of 1438 reports was retained in the Belgian dataset. 
XGBoost on TF-IDF matrix resulted in an accuracy of 0.94 and 0.92 for AF and HF, 
respectively. There were 211 mismatches between algorithm and ICD codes. One 
hundred and three were due to a difference in data availability or differing 
definitions. In the remaining 108 mismatches, 70% were due to incorrect 
labelling by the algorithm and 30% were due to erroneous ICD coding (2% of total 
hospitalizations).
CONCLUSION: A newly developed NLP algorithm attained a high accuracy for 
classifying disease in medical records. XGBoost outperformed the deep learning 
technique BioBERT. NLP algorithms could be used to identify ICD-coding errors 
and optimize and support the ICD-coding process.

BACKGROUND: Artificial intelligence (AI) has been widely adopted for the 
prediction of latent shock occurrence in critically ill patients in intensive 
care units (ICUs). However, the usefulness of an ICU-based model to predict 
latent shock risk in an emergency department (ED) setting remains unclear. This 
study aimed to develop an AI model to predict latent shock risk in patients 
admitted to EDs.
METHODS: Multiple regression analysis was used to compare the difference between 
Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care (MIMIC)-IV-ICU and MIMIC-IV-ED 
datasets. An adult noninvasive model was constructed based on the MIMIC-IV-ICU 
v3.0 database and was externally validated in populations admitted to an ED. Its 
efficiency was compared with efficiency of testing with noninvasive systolic 
blood pressure (nSBP) and shock index.
RESULTS: A total of 50,636 patients from the MIMIC-IV-ICU database was used to 
develop the model, and a total of 2,142 patients from the Philips IntelliSpace 
Critical Care and Anesthesia (ICCA)-ED and 425,087 patients from the MIMIC-IV-ED 
were used for external validation. The modeling and validation data revealed 
similar non-invasive feature distributions. Multiple regression analysis of the 
MIMIC-IV-ICU and MIMIC-IV-ED datasets showed mostly similar characteristics. The 
area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUROC) of the 
noninvasive model 10 min before the intervention was 0.90 (95% CI: 0.84-0.96), 
and the diagnosis accordance rate (DAR) was above 80%. More than 80% of latent 
shock patients were identified more than 70 min earlier using the noninvasive 
model; thus, it performed better than evaluating shock index and nSBP.
CONCLUSION: The adult noninvasive model can effectively predict latent shock 
occurrence in EDs, which is better than using shock index and nSBP.

Purpose: This study aims to establish and validate machine learning-based models 
to predict death in hospital among critical orthopaedic trauma patients with 
sepsis or respiratory failure.Methods: This study collected 523 patients from 
the Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care database. All patients were 
randomly classified into a training cohort and a validation cohort. Six 
algorithms, including logistic regression (LR), extreme gradient boosting 
machine (eXGBM), support vector machine (SVM), random forest (RF), neural 
network (NN), and decision tree (DT), were used to develop and optimize models 
in the training cohort, and internal validation of these models were conducted 
in the validation cohort. Based on a comprehensive scoring system, which 
incorporated ten evaluation metrics, the optimal model was obtained with the 
highest scores. An artificial intelligence (AI) application was deployed based 
on the optimal model in the study.Results: The in-hospital mortality was 19.69%. 
Among all developed models, the eXGBM had the highest area under the curve (AUC) 
value (0.951, 95%CI: 0.934-0.967), and it also showed the highest accuracy 
(0.902), precise (0.893), recall (0.915), and F1 score (0.904). Based on the 
scoring system, the eXGBM had the highest score of 53, followed by the RF model 
(43) and the NN model (39). The scores for the LR, SVM, and DT were 22, 36, and 
17, respectively. The decision curve analysis confirmed that both the eXGBM and 
RF models provided substantial clinical net benefits. However, the eXGBM model 
consistently outperformed the RF model across multiple evaluation metrics, 
establishing itself as the superior option for predictive modeling in this 
scenario, with the RF model as a strong secondary choice. The SHAP analysis 
revealed that SAPS II, age, respiratory rate, OASIS, and temperature were the 
most important five features contributing to the outcome.Conclusions: This study 
develops an artificial intelligence application to predict in-hospital mortality 
among critical orthopaedic trauma patients with sepsis or respiratory failure.

To the on-site nursing staff or field management in prehospital emergency care, 
it seems baffling to conduct more targeted checklist tests for a specific 
disease. To address this problem, we proposed a decision support method for 
prehospital emergency care based on ranking the importance of physiological 
variables. We used multiple logistic regression models to explore the effects of 
various physiological variables on diseases based on the area under the curve 
(AUC) value. We implemented the method on the intensive care database (i.e., the 
Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care (MIMIC-III) database) and explored 
the importance of 17 physiological variables for 24 diseases, both chronic and 
acute. We included 33,798 adult patients, using the full physiological dataset 
as experiment data. We ranked the importance of the physiological variables 
related to the diseases according to the experiments' AUC value. We discussed 
which physiological variables should be considered more important in adult 
intensive care units (ICUs) for prehospital emergency care conditions. We also 
discussed the relationships among the diseases based on ranking the importance 
of physiological variables. We used large-scale ICU patient data to obtain a 
cohort of physiological variables related to specific diseases. Ranking a cohort 
of physiological variables is a cost-effective means of reducing morbidity and 
mortality under prehospital emergency care conditions.

BACKGROUND: Predicting the prognosis of patients with acute myocardial 
infarction (AMI) combined with diabetes mellitus (DM) is crucial due to high 
in-hospital mortality rates. This study aims to develop and validate a mortality 
risk prediction model for these patients by interpretable machine learning (ML) 
methods.
METHODS: Data were sourced from the Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care 
IV (MIMIC-IV, version 2.2). Predictors were selected by Least absolute shrinkage 
and selection operator (LASSO) regression and checked for multicollinearity with 
Spearman's correlation. Patients were randomly assigned to training and 
validation sets in an 8:2 ratio. Seven ML algorithms were used to construct 
models in the training set. Model performance was evaluated in the validation 
set using metrics such as area under the curve (AUC) with 95% confidence 
interval (CI), calibration curves, precision, recall, F1 score, accuracy, 
negative predictive value (NPV), and positive predictive value (PPV). The 
significance of differences in predictive performance among models was assessed 
utilising the permutation test, and 10-fold cross-validation further validated 
the model's performance. SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) and Local 
Interpretable Model-agnostic Explanations (LIME) were applied to interpret the 
models.
RESULTS: The study included 2,828 patients with AMI combined with DM. Nineteen 
predictors were identified through LASSO regression and Spearman's correlation. 
The Random Forest (RF) model was demonstrated the best performance, with an AUC 
of 0.823 (95% CI: 0.774-0.872), high precision (0.867), accuracy (0.873), and 
PPV (0.867). The RF model showed significant differences (p < 0.05) compared to 
the K-Nearest Neighbours and Decision Tree models. Calibration curves indicated 
that the RF model's predicted risk aligned well with actual outcomes. 10-fold 
cross-validation confirmed the superior performance of RF model, with an average 
AUC of 0.828 (95% CI: 0.800-0.842). Significant Variables in RF model indicated 
that the top eight significant predictors were urine output, maximum anion gap, 
maximum urea nitrogen, age, minimum pH, maximum international normalised ratio 
(INR), mean respiratory rate, and mean systolic blood pressure.
CONCLUSION: This study demonstrates the potential of ML methods, particularly 
the RF model, in predicting in-hospital mortality risk for AMI patients with DM. 
The SHAP and LIME methods enhance the interpretability of ML models.

BACKGROUND: In 2023, the European Society of Intensive Care Medicine (ESICM) 
recommended updated criteria for acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). In 
2024, Matthay et al. updated the global ARDS definition in AJRCCM, titled "A New 
Global Definition of Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome." However, the impact 
of this new definition on ARDS treatments is currently unknown.
OBJECTIVE: This study aims to determine the effect of the new ARDS definition on 
patients with hypoxemic respiratory failure and study the heterogeneity of 
patients in the new definition to guide treatment.
METHODS: Clinical consultation data from the Medical Information Mart for 
Intensive Care IV database were extracted using Structured Query Language based 
on the PostgreSQL tool (version 10.0). Data were analyzed using Python (version 
3.9) and the deep learning framework Pytorch. Kaplan-Meier survival analysis was 
used to compare survival between the old and new definitions. A hierarchical 
clustering approach was applied to identify potential ARDS clinical subtypes.
RESULTS: The new definition diagnosed ARDS earlier and included individuals with 
lower mortality rates compared with the Berlin definition. Patients meeting the 
new definition but not the Berlin criteria exhibited a favorable response to 
non-invasive ventilation strategies (p = 0.009). The XGBoost classifier, trained 
to predict subphenotypes, achieved an AUC of 0.88 ± 0.02 on the training set. 
Additionally, mortality was significantly associated with patients with 
hypoxemia compared with survivors, particularly regarding respiratory 
parameters. Easily accessible metrics, such as respiratory rate and urea 
nitrogen (BUN), can help diagnose ARDS in high-risk populations in 
resource-limited settings.
CONCLUSIONS: The new ARDS definition offers advantages in earlier detection, 
more accurate grading, and more precise diagnosis in resource-limited settings 
compared with the Berlin definition. This study also established a robust

BACKGROUND: There are no tools specifically designed to assess mortality risk in 
patients with atrial fibrillation (AF).
AIMS: This study aimed to utilize machine learning methods to identify pertinent 
variables and develop an easily applicable prognostic score to predict 1-year 
mortality in AF patients.
METHODS: This study, based on the Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care-IV 
(MIMIC-IV) database, focused on patients aged 18 years and older with AF. A 
critical care database from China was the external validation set. The 
importance of variables from XGBoost guided the development of a logistic model, 
forming the basis for an AF scoring model.
RESULTS: Records of of 26 365 AF patients were obtained from the MIMIC-IV 
database. The external validation dataset included 231 AF patients. The CRAMB 
score (Charlson comorbidity index, readmission, age, metastatic solid tumor, and 
maximum blood urea nitrogen concentration) outperformed the CCI and CHA2DS2-VASc 
scores, demonstrating superior predictive value for 1-year mortality. In the 
test set, the area under the receiver operating characteristic (AUC) for the 
CRAMB score was 0.765 (95% confidence interval [CI], 0.753-0.776), while in the 
external validation set, it was 0.582 (95% CI, 0.502-0.657).
CONCLUSIONS: The simplicity of the CRAMB score makes it user-friendly, allowing 
for coverage of a broader and more heterogeneous AF population.

BACKGROUND: Gastrointestinal (GI) function is critical for patients in intensive 
care units (ICUs). Whether and how much critically ill patients without GI 
primary diseases benefit from abdominal physical examinations remains unknown. 
No evidence from big data supports its possible additive value in outcome 
prediction.
METHODS: We performed a big data analysis to confirm the value of abdominal 
physical examinations in ICU patients without GI primary diseases. Patients were 
selected from the Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care (MIMIC)-IV 
database and classified into two groups depending on whether they received 
abdominal palpation and auscultation. The primary outcome was the 28-day 
mortality. Statistical approaches included Cox regression, propensity score 
matching, and inverse probability of treatment weighting. Then, the abdominal 
physical examination group was randomly divided into the training and testing 
cohorts in an 8:2 ratio. And patients with GI primary diseases were selected as 
the validation group. Several machine learning algorithms, including Random 
Forest, Gradient Boosting Decision Tree, Adaboost, Extra Trees, Bagging, and 
Multi-Layer Perceptron, were used to develop in-hospital mortality predictive 
models.
RESULTS: Abdominal physical examinations were performed in 868 (2.63%) of 33,007 
patients without primary GI diseases. A significant benefit in terms of 28-day 
mortality was observed among the abdominal physical examination group (HR 0.75, 
95% CI 0.56-0.99; p = 0.043), and a higher examination frequency was associated 
with improved outcomes (HR 0.62, 95%CI 0.40-0.98; p = 0.042). Machine learning 
studies further revealed that abdominal physical examinations were valuable in 
predicting in-hospital mortality. Considering both model performance and storage 
space, the Multi-Layer Perceptron model performed the best in predicting 
mortality (AUC = 0.9548 in the testing set and AUC = 0.9833 in the validation 
set).
CONCLUSION: Conducting abdominal physical examinations improves outcomes in 
critically ill patients without GI primary diseases. The results can be used to 
predict in-hospital mortality using machine learning algorithms.

OBJECTIVE: To construct and validate the best predictive model for 28-day death 
risk in patients with septic shock based on different supervised machine 
learning algorithms.
METHODS: The patients with septic shock meeting the Sepsis-3 criteria were 
selected from Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care-IV v2.0 (MIMIC-IV 
v2.0). According to the principle of random allocation, 70% of these patients 
were used as the training set, and 30% as the validation set. Relevant 
predictive variables were extracted from three aspects: demographic 
characteristics and basic vital signs, serum indicators within 24 hours of 
intensive care unit (ICU) admission and complications possibly affecting 
indicators, functional scoring and advanced life support. The predictive 
efficacy of models constructed using five mainstream machine learning algorithms 
including decision tree classification and regression tree (CART), random forest 
(RF), support vector machine (SVM), linear regression (LR), and super learner 
[SL; combined CART, RF and extreme gradient boosting (XGBoost)] for 28-day death 
in patients with septic shock was compared, and the best algorithm model was 
selected. The optimal predictive variables were determined by intersecting the 
results from LASSO regression, RF, and XGBoost algorithms, and a predictive 
model was constructed. The predictive efficacy of the model was validated by 
drawing receiver operator characteristic curve (ROC curve), the accuracy of the 
model was assessed using calibration curves, and the practicality of the model 
was verified through decision curve analysis (DCA).
RESULTS: A total of 3 295 patients with septic shock were included, with 2 164 
surviving and 1 131 dying within 28 days, resulting in a mortality of 34.32%. Of 
these, 2 307 were in the training set (with 792 deaths within 28 days, a 
mortality of 34.33%), and 988 in the validation set (with 339 deaths within 28 
days, a mortality of 34.31%). Five machine learning models were established 
based on the training set data. After including variables at three aspects, the 
area under the ROC curve (AUC) of RF, SVM, and LR machine learning algorithm 
models for predicting 28-day death in septic shock patients in the validation 
set was 0.823 [95% confidence interval (95%CI) was 0.795-0.849], 0.823 (95%CI 
was 0.796-0.849), and 0.810 (95%CI was 0.782-0.838), respectively, which were 
higher than that of the CART algorithm model (AUC = 0.750, 95%CI was 
0.717-0.782) and SL algorithm model (AUC = 0.756, 95%CI was 0.724-0.789). Thus 
above three algorithm models were determined to be the best algorithm models. 
After integrating variables from three aspects, 16 optimal predictive variables 
were identified through intersection by LASSO regression, RF, and XGBoost 
algorithms, including the highest pH value, the highest albumin (Alb), the 
highest body temperature, the lowest lactic acid (Lac), the highest Lac, the 
highest serum creatinine (SCr), the highest Ca2+, the lowest hemoglobin (Hb), 
the lowest white blood cell count (WBC), age, simplified acute physiology score 
III (SAPS III), the highest WBC, acute physiology score III (APS III), the 
lowest Na+, body mass index (BMI), and the shortest activated partial 
thromboplastin time (APTT) within 24 hours of ICU admission. ROC curve analysis 
showed that the Logistic regression model constructed with above 16 optimal 
predictive variables was the best predictive model, with an AUC of 0.806 (95%CI 
was 0.778-0.835) in the validation set. The calibration curve and DCA curve 
showed that this model had high accuracy and the highest net benefit could reach 
0.3, which was significantly outperforming traditional models based on single 
functional score [APS III score, SAPS III score, and sequential organ failure 
assessment (SOFA) score] with AUC (95%CI) of 0.746 (0.715-0.778), 0.765 
(0.734-0.796), and 0.625 (0.589-0.661), respectively.
CONCLUSIONS: The Logistic regression model, constructed using 16 optimal 
predictive variables including pH value, Alb, body temperature, Lac, SCr, Ca2+, 
Hb, WBC, SAPS III score, APS III score, Na+, BMI, and APTT, is identified as the 
best predictive model for the 28-day death risk in patients with septic shock. 
Its performance is stable, with high discriminative ability and accuracy.

OBJECTIVE: Heart failure (HF) complicated by acute kidney injury (AKI) 
significantly impacts patient outcomes, and it is crucial to make early 
predictions of short-term mortality. This study is focused on developing an 
interpretable machine learning model to enhance early prediction accuracy in 
such clinical scenarios.
METHODS: This retrospective cohort study utilized data from the Medical 
Information Mart for Intensive Care Ⅳ (MIMIC-Ⅳ, version 2.0) database. Data from 
the first 24 hours after admission to the ICU were extracted and divided into a 
training set (70%) and a validation set (30%). We utilized the SHapley Additive 
exPlanation (SHAP) method to interpret the workings of an extreme gradient 
boosting (XGBoost) model and identify key prognostic factors. The XGBoost 
model's predictive ability was evaluated against three other machine learning 
models using the area under the curve (AUC) metric, and its interpretation was 
enhanced using the SHAP method.
RESULTS: The study included 8028 patients with HF complicated by AKI. The 
XGBoost model outperformed the other models, achieving an AUC of 0.93 (95% 
confidence interval [CI]: 0.78-0.94; accuracy = 0.89), while neural network 
model showed the worst performance (AUC = 0.79, 95% CI: 0.77-0.82; accuracy = 
0.82). Decision curve analysis showed the superior net benefit of the XGBoost 
model within the 9% to 60% threshold probabilities. SHAP analysis was performed 
to identify the top 20 predictors, with age (mean SHAP value 1.29) and Glasgow 
Coma Scale score (mean SHAP value 1.24) emerging as significant factors.
CONCLUSIONS: Our interpretable model offers an enhanced ability to predict 
mortality risk in HF patients with AKI in ICUs. This model can be used to assist 
in formulating effective treatment plans and optimizing resource allocation.

目的: 开发一种可解释的机器学习模型，以提高心力衰竭（heart failure, HF）合并急性肾损伤（acute kidney injury, 
AKI）患者短期死亡率的早期预测准确性。
方法: 本回顾性队列研究利用了基于电子病历的公开大型数据库重症医学信息数据库MIMIC-Ⅳ（Medical Information Mart for 
Intensive Care Ⅳ, 版本2.0）。提取了患者入住ICU最初24 
h的数据，并将其分为训练集（80%）和验证集（20%）。利用沙普利可加性解释（Shapley additive explanation, 
SHAP）方法解释极端梯度提升（XGBoost）模型的工作原理，并识别关键的预后因素。使用曲线下面积（area under the curve, 
AUC）指标评估XGBoost模型的预测能力，并与3种其他机器学习模型进行比较，其解释性通过SHAP方法得到增强。
结果: 研究包括8028名合并AKI的HF患者。XGBoost模型的表现优于其他模型，达到了0.93的AUC〔95%置信区间（confidence 
interval, CI） 0.78～0.94，准确度=0.89〕，而神经网络的表现最差（AUC=0.79，95%CI 
0.77～0.82，准确度=0.82）。决策曲线分析显示XGBoost模型在9%至80%的阈值概率内具有更高的净收益。SHAP分析识别了前20个预测因素，年龄以及格拉斯哥昏迷评分被识别为重要的因素，SHAP平均值分别为1.29和1.24。
结论: 本研究开发的可解释模型提高了预测ICU内HF患者并发AKI的死亡风险的能力。这个模型不仅有助于制定有效的治疗计划，还能优化资源分配。

BACKGROUND: More than 20% of patients admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) 
develop an adverse event (AE). No previous study has leveraged patients' data to 
extract the temporal features using their structural temporal patterns, that is, 
trends.
OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to improve AE prediction methods by using structural 
temporal pattern detection that captures global and local temporal trends and to 
demonstrate these improvements in the detection of acute kidney injury (AKI).
METHODS: Using the Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care dataset, 
containing 22,542 patients, we extracted both global and local trends using 
structural pattern detection methods to predict AKI (ie, binary prediction). 
Classifiers were built on 17 input features consisting of vital signs and 
laboratory test results using state-of-the-art models; the optimal classifier 
was selected for comparisons with previous approaches. The classifier with 
structural pattern detection features was compared with two baseline classifiers 
that used different temporal feature extraction approaches commonly used in the 
literature: (1) symbolic temporal pattern detection, which is the most common 
approach for multivariate time series classification; and (2) the last recorded 
value before the prediction point, which is the most common approach to extract 
temporal data in the AKI prediction literature. Moreover, we assessed the 
individual contribution of global and local trends. Classifier performance was 
measured in terms of accuracy (primary outcome), area under the curve, and 
F-measure. For all experiments, we employed 20-fold cross-validation.
RESULTS: Random forest was the best classifier using structural temporal pattern 
detection. The accuracy of the classifier with local and global trend features 
was significantly higher than that while using symbolic temporal pattern 
detection and the last recorded value (81.3% vs 70.6% vs 58.1%; P<.001). 
Excluding local or global features reduced the accuracy to 74.4% or 78.1%, 
respectively (P<.001).
CONCLUSIONS: Classifiers using features obtained from structural temporal 
pattern detection significantly improved the prediction of AKI onset in ICU 
patients over two baselines based on common previous approaches. The proposed 
method is a generalizable approach to predict AEs in critical care that may be 
used to help clinicians intervene in a timely manner to prevent or mitigate AEs.

This study aimed to identify highly valuable blood indicators for predicting the 
clinical outcomes of patients with aortic aneurysms (AA). Baseline data of 1180 
patients and 16 blood indicators were obtained from the public Medical 
Information Mart for Intensive Care-IV (MIMIC-IV) database. The association of 
blood indicators with 4 types of clinical outcomes was analyzed, and the 
prediction performance of core indicators on different outcomes was next 
evaluated. Then, we explored the detailed association between core indicators 
and key outcomes among subgroups. Finally, a machine learning model was 
established to improve the prediction performance. Generalized linear regression 
analysis indicated that only red cell volume distribution width (RDW) was 
commonly associated with 4 end-points including surgery requirement, ICU stay 
requirement, length of hospital stay, and in-hospital death (all P < .05). 
Further, RDW showed the best performance for predicting in-hospital death by 
receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis. The significant association 
between RDW and in-hospital death was then determined by 3 logistic regression 
models adjusting for different variables (all P < .05). Stratification analysis 
showed that their association was mainly observed in unruptured AA and abdominal 
AA (AAA, all P < .05). We subsequently established an RDW-based model for 
predicting the in-hospital death only in patients with unruptured AAA. The 
favorable prediction performance of the RDW-based model was verified in 
training, validation, and test sets. RDW was found to make the greatest 
contribution to in-hospital death within the model. RDW had favorable clinical 
value for predicting the in-hospital death of patients, especially in unruptured 
AAA.

BACKGROUND: Timely and accurate prediction of short-term mortality is critical 
in intensive care units (ICUs), where patients' conditions change rapidly. 
Traditional scoring systems, such as the Simplified Acute Physiology Score and 
Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation, rely on static variables 
collected within the first 24 hours of admission and do not account for 
continuously evolving clinical states. These systems lack real-time 
adaptability, interpretability, and generalizability. With the increasing 
availability of high-frequency electronic medical record (EMR) data, machine 
learning (ML) approaches have emerged as powerful tools to model complex 
temporal patterns and support dynamic clinical decision-making. However, 
existing models are often limited by their inability to handle irregular 
sampling and missing values, and many lack rigorous external validation across 
institutions.
OBJECTIVE: We aimed to develop a real-time, interpretable risk prediction model 
that continuously assesses ICU patient mortality using irregular, longitudinal 
EMR data, with improved performance and generalizability over traditional static 
scoring systems.
METHODS: A time-aware bidirectional attention-based long short-term memory 
(TBAL) model was developed using EMR data from the MIMIC-IV (Medical Information 
Mart for Intensive Care) and eICU Collaborative Research Database (eICU-CRD) 
databases, comprising 176,344 ICU stays. The model incorporated dynamic 
variables, including vital signs, laboratory results, and medication data, 
updated hourly, to perform static and continuous mortality risk assessments. 
External cross-validation and subgroup sensitivity analyses were conducted to 
evaluate robustness and fairness. Model performance was assessed using the area 
under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUROC), area under the 
precision-recall curve (AUPRC), accuracy, and F1-score. Interpretability was 
enhanced using integrated gradients to identify key predictors.
RESULTS: For the static 12-hour to 1-day mortality prediction task, the TBAL 
model achieved AUROCs of 95.9 (95% CI 94.2-97.5) and 93.3 (95% CI 91.5-95.3) and 
AUPRCs of 48.5 and 21.6 in MIMIC-IV and eICU-CRD, respectively. Accuracy and 
F1-scores reached 94.1 and 46.7 in MIMIC-IV and 92.2 and 28.1 in eICU-CRD. In 
dynamic prediction tasks, AUROCs reached 93.6 (95% CI 93.2-93.9) and 91.9 (95% 
CI 91.6-92.1), with AUPRCs of 41.3 and 50, respectively. The model maintained 
high recall for positive cases (82.6% and 79.1% in MIMIC-IV and eICU-CRD). 
Cross-database validation yielded AUROCs of 81.3 and 76.1, confirming 
generalizability. Subgroup analysis showed stable performance across age, sex, 
and severity strata, with top predictors including lactate, vasopressor use, and 
Glasgow Coma Scale score.
CONCLUSIONS: The TBAL model offers a robust, interpretable, and generalizable 
solution for dynamic real-time mortality risk prediction in ICU patients. Its 
ability to adapt to irregular temporal patterns and to provide hourly updated 
predictions positions it as a promising decision-support tool. Future work 
should validate its utility in prospective clinical trials and investigate its 
integration into real-world ICU workflows to enhance patient outcomes.

BACKGROUND: Hepatitis B-associated cirrhosis (HBC) is associated with severe 
complications and adverse clinical outcomes. This study aimed to develop and 
validate a predictive model for the occurrence of multiple complications (three 
or more) in patients with HBC and to explore the effects of multiple 
complications on HBC prognosis.
METHODS: In this retrospective cohort study, data from 121 HBC patients treated 
at Nanjing Second Hospital from February 2009 to November 2019 were analysed. 
The maximum follow-up period was 10.75 years, with a median of 5.75 years. Eight 
machine learning techniques were employed to construct predictive models, 
including C5.0, linear discriminant analysis (LDA), least absolute shrinkage and 
selection operator (LASSO), k-nearest neighbour (KNN), gradient boosting 
decision tree (GBDT), support vector machine (SVM), generalised linear model 
(GLM) and naive Bayes (NB), utilising variables such as medical history, 
demographics, clinical signs, and laboratory test results. Model performance was 
evaluated via receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis, residual 
analysis, calibration curve analysis, and decision curve analysis (DCA). The 
influence of multiple complications on HBC survival time was assessed via 
Kaplan‒Meier curve analysis. Furthermore, LASSO and univariable and 
multivariable Cox regression analyses were conducted to identify independent 
prognostic factors for overall survival (OS) in patients with HBC, followed by 
ROC, C-index, calibration curve, and DCA curve analyses of the constructed 
prognostic nomogram model. This study utilized bootstrap resampling for internal 
validation and employed the Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care IV 
(MIMIC-IV) database for external validation.
RESULTS: The GBDT model exhibited the highest area under the curve (AUC) and 
emerged as the optimal model for predicting the occurrence of multiple 
complications. The key predictive factors included posthospitalisation fever 
(PHF), body mass index (BMI), retinol binding protein (RBP), total bilirubin 
(TB) levels, and eosinophils (EOS). Kaplan-Meier analysis revealed that patients 
with multiple complications had significantly worse OS than those with fewer 
complications. Additionally, multivariable Cox regression analysis, informed by 
least absolute shrinkage and LASSO selection, identified hepatocellular 
carcinoma (HCC), multiple complications, and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) levels 
as independent prognostic factors for OS. The prognostic model demonstrated 
1-year, 3-year, and 5-year OS ROC AUCs of 0.802, 0.793, and 0.817, respectively. 
For the internal validation cohort, the corresponding AUC values were 0.797, 
0.832, and 0.835. In contrast, the external validation cohort yielded a 1-year 
ROC AUC of 0.707. Calibration curves indicated good consistency of the model, 
and DCA demonstrated the model's clinical utility, showing high net benefits 
within certain threshold ranges. Compared with the univariable models, the 
multivariable ROC curves indicated higher AUC values for this prognostic model, 
and the model also possessed the best c-index.
CONCLUSION: The GBDT prediction model provides a reliable tool for the early 
identification of high-risk HBC patients prone to developing multiple 
complications. The concurrent occurrence of multiple complications is an 
independent prognostic factor for OS in patients with HBC. The constructed 
prognostic model demonstrated remarkable predictive performance and clinical 
applicability, indicating its crucial role in enhancing patient outcomes through 
timely and targeted interventions.

BACKGROUND: Identifying key variables is essential for developing clinical 
outcome prediction models based on high-dimensional electronic medical records 
(EMR). However, despite the abundance of feature selection (FS) methods 
available, challenges remain in choosing the most appropriate method, deciding 
how many top-ranked variables to include, and ensuring these selections are 
meaningful from a medical perspective.
METHODS: We developed a practical multi-step feature selection (FS) framework 
that integrates data-driven statistical inference with a knowledge verification 
strategy. This framework was validated using two distinct EMR datasets targeting 
different clinical outcomes. The first cohort, sourced from the Medical 
Information Mart for Intensive Care III (MIMIC-III), focused on predicting acute 
kidney injury (AKI) in ICU patients. The second cohort, drawn from the MIMIC-IV 
Emergency Department (MIMIC-IV-ED), aimed to estimate in-hospital mortality 
(IHM) for patients transferred from the ED to the ICU. We employed various 
machine learning (ML) methods and conducted a comparative analysis considering 
accuracy, stability, similarity, and interpretability. The effectiveness of our 
FS framework was evaluated using discrimination and calibration metrics, with 
SHAP applied to enhance the interpretability of model decisions.
RESULTS: Cohort 1 comprised 48,780 ICU encounters, of which 8,883 (18.21%) 
developed AKI. Cohort 2 included 29,197 transfers from the ED to the ICU, with 
3,219 (11.03%) resulting in IHM. Among the ten ML methods evaluated, the 
tree-based ensemble method achieved the highest accuracy. As the number of 
top-ranking features increased, the models' accuracy began to stabilize, while 
feature subset stability (considering sample variations) and inter-method 
feature similarity reached optimal levels, confirming the validity of the FS 
framework. The integration of interpretative methods and expert knowledge in the 
final step further improved feature interpretability. The FS framework 
effectively reduced the number of features (e.g., from 380 to 35 for Cohort 1, 
and from 273 to 54 for Cohort 2) without significantly affecting prediction 
performance (Delong test, p > 0.05).
CONCLUSION: The multi-step FS method developed in this study successfully 
reduces the dimensionality of features in EMR while preserving the accuracy of 
clinical outcome prediction. Furthermore, it improves the interpretability of 
risk factors by incorporating expert knowledge validation.

AIMS: This study aimed to establish a phenotypic clustering model for critically 
ill patients with comorbid type 2 diabetes mellitus (CIP T2DM), define distinct 
subtypes, and analyze differences in clinical characteristics and treatment 
response.
METHODS: Patients from the Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care IV 
(MIMIC-IV) database were phenotyped based on demographic, physiological, and 
biochemical parameters, along with critically ill scores, using a consensus 
clustering algorithm. Subtype validity was assessed using the eICU Collaborative 
Research Database (eICU). High-frequency combination drug regimens were then 
extracted to reveal therapeutic heterogeneity among subtypes.
RESULTS: Three subtypes were identified in the MIMIC-IV cohort (n = 6349). The 
in-group proportions of 0.957, 0.898, and 0.836 in the eICU cohort (n = 1425) 
show high consistency. These three subtypes are: a) CIP T2DM with severe 
infection (CIP T2DM-SI) with a mortality of 16.7 % and a post-medication blood 
glucose (PMBG, first measured 24 h after medication administration) of 8.25 
mmol/L; b) CIP T2DM with organ failure (CIP T2DM-OF) with 18.6 % mortality and 
8.03 mmol/L PMBG; and c) CIP T2DM under monitoring for continuous observation 
and evaluation (CIP T2DM-UM) with 8.87 % mortality and 6.98 mmol/L PMBG. 
Moreover, the three subtypes showed different in-hospital mortality risks under 
the same medication regimen.
CONCLUSIONS: Three phenotypes were identified in CIP T2DM, showing significant 
heterogeneity in clinical characteristics and prognosis. Personalized 
interventions for these subtypes may help reduce adverse events and guide 
precise treatment in practice.

MOTIVATION: Electronic health records (EHRs) represent a comprehensive resource 
of a patient's medical history. EHRs are essential for utilizing advanced 
technologies such as deep learning (DL), enabling healthcare providers to 
analyze extensive data, extract valuable insights, and make precise and 
data-driven clinical decisions. DL methods such as recurrent neural networks 
(RNN) have been utilized to analyze EHR to model disease progression and predict 
diagnosis. However, these methods do not address some inherent irregularities in 
EHR data such as irregular time intervals between clinical visits. Furthermore, 
most DL models are not interpretable. In this study, we propose two 
interpretable DL architectures based on RNN, namely time-aware RNN (TA-RNN) and 
TA-RNN-autoencoder (TA-RNN-AE) to predict patient's clinical outcome in EHR at 
the next visit and multiple visits ahead, respectively. To mitigate the impact 
of irregular time intervals, we propose incorporating time embedding of the 
elapsed times between visits. For interpretability, we propose employing a 
dual-level attention mechanism that operates between visits and features within 
each visit.
RESULTS: The results of the experiments conducted on Alzheimer's Disease 
Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) and National Alzheimer's Coordinating Center 
(NACC) datasets indicated the superior performance of proposed models for 
predicting Alzheimer's Disease (AD) compared to state-of-the-art and baseline 
approaches based on F2 and sensitivity. Additionally, TA-RNN showed superior 
performance on the Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care (MIMIC-III) 
dataset for mortality prediction. In our ablation study, we observed enhanced 
predictive performance by incorporating time embedding and attention mechanisms. 
Finally, investigating attention weights helped identify influential visits and 
features in predictions.

Traumatic Brain Injury from the MIMIC Database: A Retrospective Study.

Traumatic brain injury (TBI), a major global health burden, disrupts the 
neurological system due to accidents and other incidents. While the Glasgow coma 
scale (GCS) gauges neurological function, it falls short as the sole predictor 
of overall mortality in TBI patients. This highlights the need for comprehensive 
outcome prediction, considering not just neurological but also systemic factors. 
Existing approaches relying on newly developed biomolecules face challenges in 
clinical implementation. Therefore, we investigated the potential of readily 
available clinical indicators, like the blood urea nitrogen-to-albumin ratio 
(BAR), for improved mortality prediction in TBI. In this study, we investigated 
the significance of the BAR in predicting all-cause mortality in TBI patients. 
In terms of research methodologies, we gave preference to machine learning 
methods due to their exceptional performance in clinical support in recent 
years. Initially, we obtained data on TBI patients from the Medical Information 
Mart for Intensive Care database. A total of 2602 patients were included, of 
whom 2260 survived and 342 died in hospital. Subsequently, we performed data 
cleaning and utilized machine learning techniques to develop prediction models. 
We employed a ten-fold cross-validation method to obtain models with enhanced 
accuracy and area under the curve (AUC) (Light Gradient Boost Classifier 
accuracy, 0.905 ± 0.016, and AUC, 0.888; Extreme Gradient Boost Classifier 
accuracy, 0.903 ± 0.016, and AUC, 0.895; Gradient Boost Classifier accuracy, 
0.898 ± 0.021, and AUC, 0.872). Simultaneously, we derived the importance 
ranking of the variable BAR among the included variables (in Light Gradient 
Boost Classifier, the BAR ranked fourth; in Extreme Gradient Boost Classifier, 
the BAR ranked sixth; in Gradient Boost Classifier, the BAR ranked fifth). To 
further evaluate the clinical utility of BAR, we divided patients into three 
groups based on their BAR values: Group 1 (BAR < 4.9 mg/g), Group 2 (BAR ≥ 4.9 
and ≤10.5 mg/g), and Group 3 (BAR ≥ 10.5 mg/g). This stratification revealed 
significant differences in mortality across all time points: in-hospital 
mortality (7.61% vs. 15.16% vs. 31.63%), as well as one-month (8.51% vs. 17.46% 
vs. 36.39%), three-month (9.55% vs. 20.14% vs. 41.84%), and one-year mortality 
(11.57% vs. 23.76% vs. 46.60%). Building on this observation, we employed the 
Cox proportional hazards regression model to assess the impact of BAR 
segmentation on survival. Compared to Group 1, Groups 2 and 3 had significantly 
higher hazard ratios (95% confidence interval (CI)) for one-month mortality: 
1.77 (1.37-2.30) and 3.17 (2.17-4.62), respectively. To further underscore the 
clinical potential of BAR as a standalone measure, we compared its performance 
to established clinical scores, like sequential organ failure assessment (SOFA), 
GCS, and acute physiology score III(APS-III), using receiver operator 
characteristic curve (ROC) analysis. Notably, the AUC values (95%CI) of the BAR 
were 0.67 (0.64-0.70), 0.68 (0.65-0.70), and 0.68 (0.65-0.70) for one-month 
mortality, three-month mortality, and one-year mortality. The AUC value of the 
SOFA did not significantly differ from that of the BAR. In conclusion, the BAR 
is a highly influential factor in predicting mortality in TBI patients and 
should be given careful consideration in future TBI prediction research. The 
blood urea nitrogen-to-albumin ratio may predict mortality in TBI patients.

The task of automatic generation of medical image reports faces various 
challenges, such as diverse types of diseases and a lack of professionalism and 
fluency in report descriptions. To address these issues, this paper proposes a 
multimodal medical imaging report based on memory drive method (mMIRmd). 
Firstly, a hierarchical vision transformer using shifted windows 
(Swin-Transformer) is utilized to extract multi-perspective visual features of 
patient medical images, and semantic features of textual medical history 
information are extracted using bidirectional encoder representations from 
transformers (BERT). Subsequently, the visual and semantic features are 
integrated to enhance the model's ability to recognize different disease types. 
Furthermore, a medical text pre-trained word vector dictionary is employed to 
encode labels of visual features, thereby enhancing the professionalism of the 
generated reports. Finally, a memory driven module is introduced in the decoder, 
addressing long-distance dependencies in medical image data. This study is 
validated on the chest X-ray dataset collected at Indiana University (IU X-Ray) 
and the medical information mart for intensive care chest x-ray (MIMIC-CXR) 
released by the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and Massachusetts General 
Hospital. Experimental results indicate that the proposed method can better 
focus on the affected areas, improve the accuracy and fluency of report 
generation, and assist radiologists in quickly completing medical image report 
writing.

Continuous blood pressure (BP) monitoring can produce a significant amount of 
digital data, which increases the chance of early diagnosis and improve the rate 
of survival for people diagnosed with hypertension and Cardiovascular diseases 
(CVDs). However, mining and processing this vast amount of data are challenging. 
This research is aimed to address this challenge by proposing a deep learning 
technique, convolutional neural network (CNN), to estimate the systolic blood 
pressure (SBP) using electrocardiogram (ECG) and photoplethysmography (PPG) 
signals. Two different methods are investigated and compared in this research. 
In the first method, continuous wavelet transform (CWT) and CNN have been 
employed to estimate the SBP. For the second method, we used random sampling 
within the stochastic gradient descent (SGD) optimization of CNN and the raw ECG 
and PPG signals for training the network. The Medical Information Mart for 
Intensive Care (MIMIC III) database is used for both methods, which split to two 
parts, 70% for training our network and the remaining used for testing the 
performance of the network. Both methods are capable of learning how to extract 
relevant features from the signals. Therefore, there is no need for engineered 
feature extraction compared to previous works. Our experimental results show 
high accuracy for both CNN-based methods which make them promising and reliable 
architectures for SBP estimation.

BACKGROUND: The incidence and mortality of cardiac arrest (CA) is high. We 
developed interpretable machine learning models for early prediction of ICU 
mortality risk in patients diagnosed with CA.
METHODS: Data from the Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care (MIMIC-IV, 
version 2.2) was randomized to training set (0.7) and internal validation set 
(0.3), and data from eICU(version 2.0.1) was used as external validation set. 
Five models including Logistic Regression (LR), Random Forest (RF), K Nearest 
Neighbor (KNN), Decision Tree (DT), and Extreme Gradient Boost (XGBoost) were 
developed. The model with the largest area under the Receiver Operating 
Characteristic (ROC) curve (AUC) and good performance in other features was 
defined as the best model, and Shapley Additive Explanations (SHAP) was used to 
improve the interpretability of the optimal model.
RESULTS: A total of 1088 patients from MIMIC-IV, and 3542 patients from eICU 
were included. Seven variables were selected to construct models by Least 
Absolute Shrinkage and Selection Operator (LASSO) regression. The RF model was 
the best predictive model with AUC and 95% CI at 0.83 (0.78-0.88) in internal 
validation set, and 0.71(0.68-0.74) in external validation set. SHAP analysis 
found that the variables that had a high impact on the risk of ICU death were 
minimal Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS), base excess, anion gap, and urine output.
CONCLUSION: RF is the optimal model for predicting the risk of ICU death in CA 
patients. The development of this model is important for early identification 
and intervention of CA patients who are at risk of dying in the ICU.

This study applied machine learning for the early prediction of 30-day mortality 
at sepsis diagnosis time in critically ill patients. Retrospective study using 
data collected from the Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care IV database. 
The data of the patient cohort was divided on the basis of the year of 
hospitalization, into training (2008-2013), validation (2014-2016), and testing 
(2017-2019) datasets. 24,377 patients with the sepsis diagnosis time < 24 h 
after intensive care unit (ICU) admission were included. A gradient boosting 
tree-based algorithm (XGBoost) was used for training the machine learning model 
to predict 30-day mortality at sepsis diagnosis time in critically ill patients. 
Model performance was measured in both discrimination and calibration aspects. 
The model was interpreted using the SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) module. 
The 30-day mortality rate of the testing dataset was 17.9%, and 39 features were 
selected for the machine learning model. Model performance on the testing 
dataset achieved an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve 
(AUROC) of 0.853 (95% CI 0.837-0.868) and an area under the precision-recall 
curves of 0.581 (95% CI 0.541-0.619). The calibration plot for the model 
revealed a slope of 1.03 (95% CI 0.94-1.12) and intercept of 0.14 (95% CI 
0.04-0.25). The SHAP revealed the top three most significant features, namely 
age, increased red blood cell distribution width, and respiratory rate. Our 
study demonstrated the feasibility of using the interpretable machine learning 
model to predict mortality at sepsis diagnosis time.

BACKGROUND: Sepsis remains a complex medical problem and a major challenge in 
healthcare. Diagnostics and outcome predictions are focused on physiological 
parameters with less consideration given to patients' medical background. Given 
the aging population, not only are diseases becoming increasingly prevalent but 
occur more frequently in combinations ("multimorbidity"). We hypothesized the 
existence of patient subgroups in critical care with distinct multimorbidity 
states. We further hypothesize that certain multimorbidity states associate with 
higher rates of organ failure, sepsis, and mortality co-occurring with these 
clinical problems.
METHODS: We analyzed 36,390 patients from the open source Medical Information 
Mart for Intensive Care III (MIMIC III) dataset. Morbidities were defined based 
on Elixhauser categories, a well-established scheme distinguishing 30 classes of 
chronic diseases. We used latent class analysis to identify distinct patient 
subgroups based on demographics, admission type, and morbidity compositions and 
compared the prevalence of organ dysfunction, sepsis, and inpatient mortality 
for each subgroup.
RESULTS: We identified six clinically distinct multimorbidity subgroups labeled 
based on their dominant Elixhauser disease classes. The "cardiopulmonary" and 
"cardiac" subgroups consisted of older patients with a high prevalence of 
cardiopulmonary conditions and constituted 6.1% and 26.4% of study cohort 
respectively. The "young" subgroup included 23.5% of the cohort composed of 
young and healthy patients. The "hepatic/addiction" subgroup, constituting 9.8% 
of the cohort, consisted of middle-aged patients (mean age of 52.25, 95% CI 
51.85-52.65) with the high rates of depression (20.1%), alcohol abuse (47.75%), 
drug abuse (18.2%), and liver failure (67%). The "complicated diabetics" and 
"uncomplicated diabetics" subgroups constituted 9.4% and 24.8% of the study 
cohort respectively. The complicated diabetics subgroup demonstrated higher 
rates of end-organ complications (88.3% prevalence of renal failure). Rates of 
organ dysfunction and sepsis ranged 19.6-69% and 12.5-46.7% respectively in the 
six subgroups. Mortality co-occurring with organ dysfunction and sepsis ranges 
was 8.4-23.8% and 11.7-27.4% respectively. These adverse outcomes were most 
prevalent in the hepatic/addiction subgroup.
CONCLUSION: We identify distinct multimorbidity states that associate with 
relatively higher prevalence of organ dysfunction, sepsis, and co-occurring 
mortality. The findings promote the incorporation of multimorbidity in 
healthcare models and the shift away from the current single-disease paradigm in 
clinical practice, training, and trial design.

We aimed to develop and validate multimodal ICU patient prognosis models that 
combine clinical parameters data and chest X-ray (CXR) images. A total of 3798 
subjects with clinical parameters and CXR images were extracted from the Medical 
Information Mart for Intensive Care IV (MIMIC-IV) database and an external 
hospital (the test set). The primary outcome was 30-day mortality after ICU 
admission. Automated machine learning (AutoML) and convolutional neural networks 
(CNNs) were used to construct single-modal models based on clinical parameters 
and CXR separately. An early fusion approach was used to integrate both 
modalities (clinical parameters and CXR) into a multimodal model named PrismICU. 
Compared to the single-modal models, i.e., the clinical parameter model 
(AUC = 0.80, F1-score = 0.43) and the CXR model (AUC = 0.76, F1-score = 0.45) 
and the scoring system APACHE II (AUC = 0.83, F1-score = 0.77), PrismICU 
(AUC = 0.95, F1 score = 0.95) showed improved performance in predicting the 
30-day mortality in the validation set. In the test set, PrismICU (AUC = 0.82, 
F1-score = 0.61) was also better than the clinical parameters model (AUC = 0.72, 
F1-score = 0.50), CXR model (AUC = 0.71, F1-score = 0.36), and APACHE II 
(AUC = 0.62, F1-score = 0.50). PrismICU, which integrated clinical parameters 
data and CXR images, performed better than single-modal models and the existing 
scoring system. It supports the potential of multimodal models based on 
structured data and imaging in clinical management.

OBJECTIVE: Machine learning (ML) has enabled healthcare discoveries by 
facilitating efficient modeling, such as for cancer screening. Unlike clinical 
trials, real-world data used in ML are often gathered for multiple purposes, 
leading to bias and missing information for a specific classification task. This 
challenge is especially pronounced in healthcare because of stringent ethical 
considerations and resource constraints.This study proposed an integrated 
approach to enhance the quality of health evidence from a classification task 
for predicting Medicare's Diagnosis-Related Groups of ischemic heart disease 
(IHD) patients.
METHODS: Eligible participants were identified from the Medical Information Mart 
for Intensive Care IV (MIMIC IV), a publicly available hospital database. Six ML 
models were selected for model triangulation. Sequential triangulation was 
employed via Local Process Mining (LPM) and Qualitative Comparative Analysis 
(QCA).
RESULTS: A total of 1545 IHD hospitalizations from 916 patients were identified 
from the MIMIC IV. Eight health process features were identified through LPM 
aligned with clinical knowledge. The correlation coefficients for process 
features, ranging from 0.24 to 0.42, are higher than those for non-process 
features ranged from 0.02 to 0.36. A total of 56 unique combinations were 
identified from the QCA, with 28 configurations having raw coverage lower than 
1.0%. The overall model performance (i.e. weighted F1 and area under the curve 
scores) increased after adopting this integrated approach. The proportion of 
cases misclassified by any of the six models decreased by 47% after 
incorporating process features (from 5.29% to 2.91%) and further decreased to 
0.0% after applying the QCA solutions.
CONCLUSION: The integrated approach demonstrates its ability to enhance quality 
of a classification task through its clinical relevance, improved model 
performance, and reduced case-level error rates. However, more scalable QCA 
methods are needed for larger datasets. Developing health process feature 
engineering for broader applications can be a future direction.

Extraction of Information Related to Drug Safety Surveillance From Electronic 
Health Record Notes: Joint Modeling of Entities and Relations Using 
Knowledge-Aware Neural Attentive Models.

BACKGROUND: An adverse drug event (ADE) is commonly defined as "an injury 
resulting from medical intervention related to a drug." Providing information 
related to ADEs and alerting caregivers at the point of care can reduce the risk 
of prescription and diagnostic errors and improve health outcomes. ADEs captured 
in structured data in electronic health records (EHRs) as either coded problems 
or allergies are often incomplete, leading to underreporting. Therefore, it is 
important to develop capabilities to process unstructured EHR data in the form 
of clinical notes, which contain a richer documentation of a patient's ADE. 
Several natural language processing (NLP) systems have been proposed to 
automatically extract information related to ADEs. However, the results from 
these systems showed that significant improvement is still required for the 
automatic extraction of ADEs from clinical notes.
OBJECTIVE: This study aims to improve the automatic extraction of ADEs and 
related information such as drugs, their attributes, and reason for 
administration from the clinical notes of patients.
METHODS: This research was conducted using discharge summaries from the Medical 
Information Mart for Intensive Care III (MIMIC-III) database obtained through 
the 2018 National NLP Clinical Challenges (n2c2) annotated with drugs, drug 
attributes (ie, strength, form, frequency, route, dosage, duration), ADEs, 
reasons, and relations between drugs and other entities. We developed a deep 
learning-based system for extracting these drug-centric concepts and relations 
simultaneously using a joint method enhanced with contextualized embeddings, a 
position-attention mechanism, and knowledge representations. The joint method 
generated different sentence representations for each drug, which were then used 
to extract related concepts and relations simultaneously. Contextualized 
representations trained on the MIMIC-III database were used to capture 
context-sensitive meanings of words. The position-attention mechanism amplified 
the benefits of the joint method by generating sentence representations that 
capture long-distance relations. Knowledge representations were obtained from 
graph embeddings created using the US Food and Drug Administration Adverse Event 
Reporting System database to improve relation extraction, especially when 
contextual clues were insufficient.
RESULTS: Our system achieved new state-of-the-art results on the n2c2 data set, 
with significant improvements in recognizing crucial drug-reason (F1=0.650 
versus F1=0.579) and drug-ADE (F1=0.490 versus F1=0.476) relations.
CONCLUSIONS: This study presents a system for extracting drug-centric concepts 
and relations that outperformed current state-of-the-art results and shows that 
contextualized embeddings, position-attention mechanisms, and knowledge graph 
embeddings effectively improve deep learning-based concepts and relation 
extraction. This study demonstrates the potential for deep learning-based 
methods to help extract real-world evidence from unstructured patient data for 
drug safety surveillance.

OBJECTIVE: Electronic health record systems have made it possible for clinicians 
to use previously encountered similar cases to support clinical decision-making. 
However, most studies for similar case retrieval were based on single-modal 
data. The existing studies on cross-modal clinical case retrieval were limited. 
We aimed to develop a CRoss-Modal Retrieval (CRMR) model to retrieve similar 
clinical cases recorded in different data modalities.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: The publically available Medical Information Mart for 
Intensive Care-Chest X-ray (MIMIC-CXR) dataset was used for model development 
and testing. The CRMR model was designed as a modular model containing two 
feature extraction models, two feature transformation models, one feature 
transformation optimization model, and one case retrieval model. The ability to 
retrieve similar clinical cases recorded in different data modalities was 
facilitated by the use of contrastive deep learning and k-nearest neighbor 
search.
RESULTS: The average retrieval precision, denoted as AP@k, of the developed CRMR 
model, were 76.9 %@5, 76.7 %@10, 76.5 %@20, 76.3 %@50, and 77.9 %@100, 
respectively. Here k is the number of similar cases returned after retrieval. 
The average retrieval time varied from 0.013 ms to 0.016 ms with k varying from 
5 to 100. Moreover, the model can retrieve similar cases with the same multiple 
radiographic manifestations as the query case.
DISCUSSION: The CRMR model has shown promising cross-modal retrieval performance 
in clinical case analysis, with the potential for future scalability and 
improvement in handling diverse disease types and data modalities. The CRMR 
model has promising potential to aid clinicians in making optimal and 
explainable clinical decisions.

INTRODUCTION: Transformer-based large language models (LLMs) have transformed 
the field of natural language processing and led to significant advancements in 
various text processing tasks. However, the applicability of these LLMs in 
identifying related drug-adverse event (AE) pairs within clinical context may be 
limited by the prevalent use of non-standard sentence structures and grammar.
METHOD: Nine transformer-based LLMs pre-trained on biomedical domain corpora are 
fine-tuned on annotated data (n = 5088) to classify drug-AE pairs in 
unstructured discharge summaries as causally related or unrelated. These LLMs 
are then validated on text segments from deidentified hospital discharge 
summaries from Singapore (n = 1647). To assess generalisability, the models are 
validated on annotated segments (n = 4418) from the Medical Information Mart for 
Intensive Care (MIMIC-III) database. Performance of LLMs in identifying related 
drug-AE pairs is then compared against a prior benchmark set by traditional 
machine learning models on the same data.
RESULTS: Using an LLM-Bidirectional long short-term memory (LLM-BiLSTM) 
architecture, transformer-based LLMs improve F1 score as compared to prior 
benchmark with BioM-ELECTRA-Large-BiLSTM showing an average F1 score improvement 
of 16.1% (increase from 0.64 to 0.74). Applying additional rules on the 
LLM-based predictions, like ignoring drug-AE pairs when the AE is a known 
indication of the drug, results in a further reduction in false positive rates 
with precision increases of up to 5.6% (0.04 increment).
CONCLUSION: Transformer-based LLMs outperform traditional machine learning 
methods in identifying causally related drug-AE pairs embedded within 
unstructured discharge summaries. Nonetheless the improvement in performance 
with rules indicates that LLMs still possess some degree of imperfection for 
this causal relation detection task.

BACKGROUND: This study investigates the relationship between prolonged elevated 
heart rate (pe-HR) and mortality among patients with sepsis-associated acute 
kidney injury (S-AKI) using causal inference and machine learning.
METHODS: Pe-HR was defined as a heart rate exceeding 100 beats/min for 11 hours 
within a 12-hour interval. The average treatment effect (ATE) was a measure of 
the therapeutic effect of β-blockers. The primary outcome measure of the study 
was the 90-day survival and hospitalization survival as the secondary endpoint. 
Four machine learning algorithms were employed to assess whether an increase in 
pe-HR enhanced the performance of predictions.
RESULTS: The study included a total of 14,388 patients with S-AKI from MIMIC 
(Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care)-IV. The results revealed that both 
90-day and in-hospital survival were lower in patients with pe-HR than in those 
without (hazard ratio: 1.62 for 90-day survival and 1.22 for in-hospital 
survival). The ATE of development pe-HR was 56.3 days survival higher than 
without pe-HR. The ATE of β-blocker use was 40.2 days survival higher than no 
use. Four machine learning algorithms showed that the inclusion of pe-HR 
improved the accuracy of 90-day survival predictions (p < 0.05), with the best 
area under the receiver operating characteristic curve reaching 0.76.
CONCLUSION: In S-AKI patients, pe-HR was significantly associated with lower 
survival rates. Including pe-HR in prediction models improved their accuracy for 
90-day survival. Our results suggest a causal relationship, highlighting the 
potential therapeutic benefit of β-blockers in managing S-AKI patients.

BACKGROUND: Recent studies showed histamine H2 receptor antagonists (H2RAs) 
exposure was associated with reduced mortality in heart failure (HF) patients. 
However, specific HF patients who are sensitive to H2RAs exposure or not are yet 
to be further defined.
AIM: This study aimed to identify HF patient characteristics that may benefit 
from H2RAs exposure.
METHOD: Neural network-based variational autoencoders and Gaussian Mixture Model 
(GMM) clustering methods were employed to classify the critically ill patients 
with HF exposed to H2RAs based on Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care 
III and IV databases. Binary logistic and multivariable Cox regression analysis 
based on propensity score matching (PSM) were employed to estimate the 
association between H2RAs exposure of each cluster and all-cause mortality of 
included patients.
RESULTS: A total of 9,585 H2RAs users among 23,855 included HF patients were 
identified into four clusters according to GMM clustering: cluster 1 (combined 
with acute kidney failure, septic shock, and pneumonia), cluster 2 (combined 
with atrial fibrillation), cluster 3 (combined with coronary artery disease 
(CAD) and/or had higher urine output), and cluster 4 (co-administered with 
calcium-antagonists). The cluster 3 patients were significantly associated with 
reduced all-cause mortality compared with non-H2RAs users after PSM, which were 
further validated in 14,280 HF patients from the large multi-center electronic 
intensive care unit Collaborative Research Database (eICU-CRD).
CONCLUSION: Histamine H2 receptor antagonist exposure was more sensitive in HF 
patients who were combined with CAD. Furthermore, male HF patients or those with 
higher urine output were also sensitive to H2RAs exposure.

BACKGROUND: Chronic critical illness (CCI) is a serious condition characterized 
by a prolonged course of illness, resulting in elevated morbidity and mortality. 
CCI presents significant challenges for healthcare providers in intensive care 
units (ICUs), particularly among patients with bone trauma. Accurate prediction 
of CCI in this patient population is essential for effective management and 
intervention. This study aims to develop a web-based artificial intelligence 
(AI) application designed to predict CCI in ICU patients suffering from bone 
trauma.
METHODS: A cohort of 1049 patients were included in the study, with 775 patients 
from the Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care III (MIMIC-III) database 
and 274 patients from two tertiary hospitals. Five machine learning techniques 
and logistic regression were employed to develop the models, using 80% of the 
MIMIC-III cohort. The models' internal effectiveness was evaluated using the 
remaining 20% of the cohort, and external validation was performed on the 274 
prospective patients. Eleven evaluation metrics were used to develop a scoring 
system for comprehensive performance evaluation.
RESULTS: Among all the models evaluated, the eXGBoosting Machine (eXGBM) model 
demonstrated the highest performance in internal validation, with an area under 
the curve (AUC) value of 0.979 (95%CI: 0.970-0.991). It outperformed the Random 
Forest (RF) model, which had an AUC of 0.957 (95%CI: 0.941-0.967), and the 
Support Vector Machine (SVM) model, which achieved an AUC of 0.911 (95%CI: 
0.878-0.928). The Logistic Regression (LR) model had a relatively lower AUC of 
0.753 (95%CI: 0.714-0.793). In terms of various evaluation metrics, including 
accuracy (0.925), precision (0.906), recall (0.947), specificity (0.902), F1 
score (0.926), Brier score (0.056), and Log loss (0.197), the eXGBM model 
consistently outperformed the other models. Additionally, based on the scoring 
system, the eXGBM model achieved the highest prediction score of 60, followed by 
the RF model with a score of 52 and the K-Nearest Neighbor (KNN) model with a 
score of 39. External validation of the eXGBM model resulted in an AUC of 0.887 
(95%CI: 0.863-0.917), confirming its robust performance and generalizability. A 
user-friendly web-based AI application based on the eXGBM model was successfully 
developed and was freely accessible at the Internet.
CONCLUSIONS: The development of a web-based AI application utilizing the eXGBM 
model demonstrates a promising advancement in the prediction of CCI among ICU 
patients. With favorable performance in both internal and external validation, 
the AI application not only achieved high accuracy and reliability but also 
provided a user-friendly tool for clinicians. This application has the potential 
to enhance patient management and care by facilitating timely interventions for 
at-risk patients. Future research should focus on further refining the model and 
exploring its integration into clinical practice to improve outcomes in this 
patient population.

OBJECTIVES: Although illness severity scoring systems are widely used to support 
clinical decision-making and assess ICU performance, their potential bias across 
different age, sex, and primary language groups has not been well-studied.
DESIGN SETTING AND PATIENTS: We aimed to identify potential bias of Sequential 
Organ Failure Assessment (SOFA) and Acute Physiology and Chronic Health 
Evaluation (APACHE) IVa scores via large ICU databases.
SETTING/PATIENTS: This multicenter, retrospective study was conducted using data 
from the Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care (MIMIC) and eICU 
Collaborative Research Database. SOFA and APACHE IVa scores were obtained from 
ICU admission. Hospital mortality was the primary outcome. Discrimination (area 
under receiver operating characteristic [AUROC] curve) and calibration 
(standardized mortality ratio [SMR]) were assessed for all subgroups.
INTERVENTIONS: Not applicable.
MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: A total of 196,310 patient encounters were 
studied. Discrimination for both scores was worse in older patients compared 
with younger patients and female patients rather than male patients. In MIMIC, 
discrimination of SOFA in non-English primary language speakers patients was 
worse than that of English speakers (AUROC 0.726 vs. 0.783, p < 0.0001). 
Evaluating calibration via SMR showed statistically significant underestimations 
of mortality when compared with overall cohort in the oldest patients for both 
SOFA and APACHE IVa, female patients (1.09) for SOFA, and non-English primary 
language patients (1.38) for SOFA in MIMIC.
CONCLUSIONS: Differences in discrimination and calibration of two scores across 
varying age, sex, and primary language groups suggest illness severity scores 
are prone to bias in mortality predictions. Caution must be taken when using 
them for quality benchmarking and decision-making among diverse real-world 
populations.

Sepsis, septic shock, and cardiogenic shock are life-threatening conditions 
associated with high mortality rates, but differentiating them is complex 
because they share certain symptoms. Using the Medical Information Mart for 
Intensive Care (MIMIC)-III database and artificial intelligence (AI), we aimed 
to increase diagnostic precision, focusing on Bayesian network classifiers 
(BNCs) and comparing them with other AI methods. Data from 5970 adults, 
including 950 patients with cardiogenic shock, 1946 patients with septic shock, 
and 3074 patients with sepsis, were extracted for this study. Of the original 51 
variables included in the data records, 12 were selected for constructing the 
predictive model. The data were divided into training and validation sets at an 
80:20 ratio, and the performance of the BNCs was evaluated and compared with 
that of other AI models, such as the one rule classifier (OneR), classification 
and regression tree (CART), and an artificial neural network (ANN), in terms of 
accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, precision, and F1-score. The BNCs exhibited 
an accuracy of 87.6% to 91.5%. The CART model demonstrated a notable 91.6% 
accuracy when only three decision levels were used, whereas the intricate ANN 
model reached 90.5% accuracy. Both the BNCs and the CART model allowed clear 
interpretation of the predictions. BNCs have the potential to be valuable tools 
in diagnostic tasks, with an accuracy, sensitivity, and precision comparable, in 
some cases, to those of ANNs while demonstrating superior interpretability.

Aiming at the problem that the small samples of critical disease in clinic may 
lead to prognostic models with poor performance of overfitting, large prediction 
error and instability, the long short-term memory transferring algorithm 
(transLSTM) was proposed. Based on the idea of transfer learning, the algorithm 
leverages the correlation between diseases to transfer information of different 
disease prognostic models, constructs the effictive model of target disease of 
small samples with the aid of large data of related diseases, hence improves the 
prediction performance and reduces the requirement for target training sample 
quantity. The transLSTM algorithm firstly uses the related disease samples to 
pretrain partial model parameters, and then further adjusts the whole network 
with the target training samples. The testing results on MIMIC-Ⅲ database showed 
that compared with traditional LSTM classification algorithm, the transLSTM 
algorithm had 0.02-0.07 higher AUROC and 0.05-0.14 larger AUPRC, while its 
number of training iterations was only 39%-64% of the traditional algorithm. The 
results of application on sepsis revealed that the transLSTM model of only 100 
training samples had comparable mortality prediction performance to the 
traditional model of 250 training samples. In small sample situations, the 
transLSTM algorithm has significant advantages with higher prediciton accuracy 
and faster training speed. It realizes the application of transfer learning in 
the prognostic model of critical disease with small samples.

BACKGROUND: Sepsis is a life-threatening condition frequently observed in 
patients with intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH) who are critically ill. Early and 
accurate identification and prediction of sepsis are crucial. Machine learning 
(ML)-based predictive models exhibit promising sepsis prediction capabilities in 
emergency settings. However, their application in predicting sepsis among 
patients with ICH is still limited.
OBJECTIVE: The aim of the study is to develop an ML-driven risk calculator for 
early prediction of sepsis in patients with ICH who are critically ill and to 
clarify feature importance and explain the model using the Shapley Additive 
Explanations method.
METHODS: Patients with ICH admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) from the 
Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care IV database between 2008 and 2022 
were divided into training and internal test sets. The external test was 
performed using the eICU Collaborative Research Database, which includes over 
200,000 ICU admissions across the United States between 2014 and 2015. Sepsis 
following ICU admission was identified using Sepsis-3.0 through clinical 
diagnosis combining elevation of the Sequential Organ Failure Assessment by ≥2 
points with suspected infection. The Boruta algorithm was used for feature 
selection, confirming 29 features. Nine ML algorithms were used to construct the 
prediction models. Predictive performance was compared using several evaluation 
metrics, including the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve 
(AUC). The Shapley Additive Explanations technique was used to interpret the 
final model, and a web-based risk calculator was constructed for clinical 
practice.
RESULTS: Overall, 2414 patients with ICH were enrolled from the Medical 
Information Mart for Intensive Care IV database, with 1689 and 725 patients 
assigned to the training and internal test sets, respectively. An external test 
set of 2806 patients with ICH from the eICU database was used. Among the 9 ML 
models tested, the categorical boosting (CatBoost) model demonstrated the best 
discriminative ability. After reducing features based on their importance, an 
explainable final CatBoost model was developed using 8 features. The final model 
accurately predicted sepsis in internal (AUC=0.812) and external (AUC=0.771) 
tests.
CONCLUSIONS: We constructed a web-based risk calculator with 8 features based on 
the CatBoost model to assist clinicians in identifying people at high risk for 
sepsis in patients with ICH who are critically ill.

Prostate cancer is the second most diagnosed cancer in the world. Treatment 
guidelines involve a multitude of therapies, however adherence to them is not 
fully established, while lack of personalized treatment strategies fails to put 
the patient as an individual clinical profile at the center of their treatment. 
We aim to present the concept of a digital treatment analyzer (TA) for the 
management of prostate cancer (PC) patients, leveraging real-world data (RWD) 
and predictive modeling to enhance personalized disease management strategies 
and adherence to PC guidelines, ultimately aiming to optimize therapeutic 
efficacy and improve outcomes. The TA comprises digital tools integrated into 
one user-intuitive interface, facilitating the development of patient-specific 
clinical profiles, classification of patients into matched historical RWD 
cohorts, presentation of relevant clinical guidelines, visual representation of 
treatment and outcomes, and mortality risk prediction based on a validated 
machine learning models. The Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care (MIMIC) 
IV dataset was utilized, including structured and unstructured data from the 
patient journey. The developed TA represents a promising approach to enhance 
personalized disease management strategies and adherence to PC guidelines. By 
integrating contemporary clinical guidelines, RWD and AI-driven insights, our 
digital TA aims to optimize therapeutic efficacy and improve patient outcomes. 
The presented concept demonstrates the potential for using a digital approach 
that integrates RWD into a treatment journey, to provide healthcare stakeholders 
with a holistic approach to PC management involving all available modern tools 
to achieve optimal outcomes.

Atrial Fibrillation Detection During Sepsis: Study on MIMIC III ICU Data.

Bashar SK, Hossain MB, Ding E, Walkey AJ, McManus DD, Chon KH.

Sepsis is defined by life-threatening organ dysfunction during infection and is 
one of the leading causes of critical illness. During sepsis, there is high risk 
that new-onset of atrial fibrillation (AF) can occur, which is associated with 
significant morbidity and mortality. As a result, computer aided automated and 
reliable detection of new-onset AF during sepsis is crucial, especially for the 
critically ill patients in the intensive care unit (ICU). In this paper, a novel 
automated and robust two-step algorithm to detect AF from ICU patients using 
electrocardiogram (ECG) signals is presented. First, several statistical 
parameters including root mean square of successive differences, Shannon 
entropy, and sample entropy were calculated from the heart rate for the 
screening of possible AF segments. Next, Poincaré plot-based features along with 
P-wave characteristics were used to reduce false positive detection of AF, 
caused by the premature atrial and ventricular beats. A subset of the Medical 
Information Mart for Intensive Care (MIMIC) III database containing 198 subjects 
was used in this study. During the training and validation phases, both the 
simple thresholding as well as machine learning classifiers achieved very high 
segment-wise AF classification performance. Finally, we tested the performance 
of our proposed algorithm using two independent test data sets and compared the 
performance with two state-of-the-art methods. The algorithm achieved an overall 
100% sensitivity, 98% specificity, 98.99% accuracy, 98% positive predictive 
value, and 100% negative predictive value on the subject-wise AF detection, thus 
showing the efficacy of our proposed algorithm in critically ill sepsis 
patients. The annotations of the data have been made publicly available for 
other investigators.

BACKGROUND: The rapid assessment of the conditions is crucial for the prognosis 
of atrial fibrillation (AF) patients admitted to the emergency department (ED). 
We aim to derive and validate a more accurate and simplified scoring model to 
optimize the triage of AF patients in the ED.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: We conducted a retrospective study using data from the 
Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care (MIMIC-IV) database and developed 
scoring models employing the Random Forest algorithm. The area under the 
receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve (AUC) was used to measure the 
performance of the prediction for intensive care unit (ICU) stay, and the death 
likelihood within 3, 7, and 30 days following the ED admission.
RESULTS: The study included 30 366 AF patients, randomly divided into training, 
validation, and testing cohorts at a 7:1:2 ratio. The training set consisted of 
21 257 patients, the validation set included 3036 patients, and the remaining 
6073 patients were classified as the validation set. Among the cohorts, 9594 
patients (32%) required ICU transfers, with mortality rates of 1% at 3 days, 3% 
at 7 days, and 6% at 30 days. In the testing set, the scoring models 
demonstrated strong discriminative ability with AUCs of 0.724 for ICU stay, 
0.782 for 3-day mortality, 0.755 for 7-day mortality, and 0.767 for 30-day 
mortality.
CONCLUSION: We derived and validated novel simplified scoring models with good 
discriminative performance to predict the likelihood of ICU stay, 3-day, 7-day, 
and 30-day death in AF patients after ED admission.

BACKGROUND: Renal replacement therapy (RRT) plays a crucial role in managing 
acute pancreatitis (AP). This study aimed to develop and evaluate predictive 
models for determining the need for RRT among patients with AP in the intensive 
care unit (ICU).
METHODS: A retrospective selection of patients with AP was made from the Medical 
Information Mart for Intensive Care IV (MIMIC-IV, version V2.0). The cohort was 
randomly divided into a training set (447 patients) and a validation set (150 
patients). The least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) 
regression cross-validation method was utilized to identify key features for 
model construction. Using these features, four machine learning (ML) algorithms 
were developed. The optimal model was visualized and clarified using SHapley 
Additive exPlanations (SHAP) and presented as a nomogram.
RESULTS: The mean age of the cohort was 59.17 years, with an average Acute 
Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation II (APACHE II) score of 17.55. Acute 
kidney injury (AKI) was observed in 52.43% of patients with AP, and 9.05% 
required RRT. After feature selection, four of 41 clinical factors were 
ultimately chosen for use in model construction. The Lasso-Logistic Regression 
(Lasso-LR) model showed a high discriminative ability to predict RRT risk in 
patients with AP, with an area under the receiver operating characteristic 
(AUROC) of 0.955 (95% CI 0.924-0.987) in the training set. In the validation 
set, it maintained its discriminative performance, achieving an AUROC of 0.985 
(95% CI 0.970-1.000). Calibration curves indicated an excellent fit in both sets 
(Brier scores: 0.039 and 0.032, respectively), suggesting high consistency. 
Decision curve analysis (DCA) highlighted the Lasso-LR model's significant 
clinical utility in predicting RRT likelihood in patients with AP.
CONCLUSIONS: Developed via the LASSO regression cross-validation method, the 
Lasso-LR model significantly excels in predicting the requirement for RRT in 
patients with AP, demonstrating its potential for clinical application.

BACKGROUND: The Braden Skin Score (BSS), a tool for assessing pressure ulcers, 
is increasingly recognized for its prognostic value in various disorders. 
However, its link to critical delirium in surgical patients remains 
understudied. This study aimed to explore the association between BSS upon 
admission and the risk of delirium in SICU patients.
METHODS: This retrospective observational cohort study used data from the 
Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care (MIMIC)-IV database. The primary 
outcome was incidence of delirium. Feature importance of BSS was initially 
assessed using a machine learning algorithm, while restricted cubic spline (RCS) 
models and multivariable logistic analysis evaluated the relationship between 
BSS and delirium. Additionally, Kaplan-Meier analysis and mediation analysis 
were conducted to explore interactions among BSS, delirium, and short-term 
mortality.
RESULTS: A total of 4,899 patients were included in the study, among whom 1,491 
were diagnosed with delirium. The Boruta algorithm identified BSS as a 
significant predictor of delirium occurrence. RCS models demonstrated a 
non-linear positive relationship between BSS and delirium. Based on RCS curves, 
the optimal threshold for BSS was established at 16, thereby categorizing 
participants into two groups: those with BSS < 16 and those with BSS ≥ 16. 
Multivariable logistic regression analysis revealed that lower BSS was 
positively correlated with an increased risk of delirium. These findings 
exhibited robust consistency across subgroup analyses and sensitivity analyses. 
Furthermore, patients in lower BSS groups had a higher 90-day mortality, with 
delirium mediating an indirect effect on this outcome.
CONCLUSION: The low BSS was independently associated with an increased risk of 
delirium in critically ill surgical patients. Patients exhibiting a BSS below 16 
demonstrated heightened susceptibility to the onset of delirium, thereby 
necessitating vigilant monitoring and timely intervention. Larger prospective 
studies are needed to confirm these findings.

BACKGROUND: Clinical decision of extubation is a challenge in the treatment of 
patient with invasive mechanical ventilation (IMV), since existing extubation 
protocols are not capable of precisely predicting extubation failure (EF). This 
study aims to develop and validate interpretable recurrent neural network (RNN) 
models for dynamically predicting EF risk.
METHODS: A retrospective cohort study was conducted on IMV patients from the 
Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care IV (MIMIC-IV) database. Time series 
with a 4-h resolution were built for all included patients. Two types of RNN 
models, the long short-term memory (LSTM) and the gated recurrent unit (GRU), 
were developed. A stepwise logistic regression model was used to select key 
features for developing light-version RNN models. The RNN models were compared 
to other five non-temporal machine learning models. The Shapley additive 
explanations (SHAP) value was applied to explain the influence of the features 
on model prediction.
RESULTS: Of 8,599 included patients, 2,609 had EF (30.3%). The area under 
receiver operating characteristic curve (AUROC) of LSTM and GRU showed no 
statistical difference on the test set (0.828 vs. 0.829). The light-version RNN 
models based on the 26 features selected out of a total of 89 features showed 
comparable performance as their corresponding full-version models. Among the 
non-temporal models, only the random forest (RF) (AUROC: 0.820) and the extreme 
gradient boosting (XGB) model (AUROC: 0.823) were comparable to the RNN models, 
but their calibration was deviated.
CONCLUSIONS: The RNN models have excellent predictive performance for predicting 
EF risk and have potential to become real-time assistant decision-making systems 
for extubation.

BACKGROUND: Rheumatic heart disease (RHD) accounts for a large proportion of 
Intensive Care Unit (ICU) deaths. Early prediction of RHD can help with timely 
and appropriate treatment to improve survival outcomes, and the XGBoost machine 
learning technology can be used to identify predictive factors; however, its use 
has been limited in the past. We compared the performance of logistic regression 
and XGBoost in predicting hospital mortality among patients with RHD from the 
Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care IV (MIMIC-IV) database.
METHODS: The patients with RHD in the MIMIC-IV database were divided into two 
groups retrospectively according to the availability of data and its clinical 
significance based on whether they survived or died. Backward stepwise 
regression was used to analyze the independent factors influencing patients with 
RHD, and to compare the differences between the two groups. The XGBoost 
algorithm and logistic regression were used to establish two prediction models, 
and the areas under the receiver operating characteristic curves (AUCs) and 
decision-curve analysis (DCA) were used to test and compare the models. Finally, 
DCA and the clinical impact curve (CIC) were used to validate the model.
RESULTS: Data on 1,634 patients with RHD were analyzed, comprising 207 who died 
during hospitalization and 1,427 survived. According to estimated results for 
the two models using AUCs [0.838 (95% confidence interval = 0.786-0.891) and 
0.815 (95% confidence interval = 0.765-0.865)] and DCA, the logistic regression 
model performed better. DCA and CIC verified that the logistic regression model 
had convincing predictive value.
CONCLUSIONS: We used logistic regression analysis to establish a more meaningful 
prediction model for the final outcome of patients with RHD. This model might be 
clinically useful for patients with RHD and help clinicians to provide detailed 
treatments and precise management.

BACKGROUND: Early prediction of acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) of 
critically ill patients in intensive care units (ICUs) has been intensively 
studied in the past years. Yet a prediction model trained on data from one 
hospital might not be well generalized to other hospitals. It is therefore 
essential to develop an accurate and generalizable ARDS prediction model 
adaptive to different hospital or medical centers.
METHODS: We analyzed electronic medical records of 200,859 and 50,920 
hospitalized patients within 24 h after being diagnosed with ARDS from the 
Philips eICU Institute (eICU-CRD) and the Medical Information Mart for Intensive 
Care (MIMIC-IV) dataset, respectively. Patients were sorted into three groups, 
including rapid death, long stay, and recovery, based on their condition or 
outcome between 24 and 72 h after ARDS diagnosis. To improve prediction 
performance and generalizability, a "pretrain-finetune" approach was applied, 
where we pretrained models on the eICU-CRD dataset and performed model 
finetuning using only a part (35%) of the MIMIC-IV dataset, and then tested the 
finetuned models on the remaining data from the MIMIC-IV dataset. Well-known 
machine-learning algorithms, including logistic regression, random forest, 
extreme gradient boosting, and multilayer perceptron neural networks, were 
employed to predict ARDS outcomes. Prediction performance was evaluated using 
the area under the receiver-operating characteristic curve (AUC).
RESULTS: Results show that, in general, multilayer perceptron neural networks 
outperformed the other models. The use of pretrain-finetune yielded improved 
performance in predicting ARDS outcomes achieving a micro-AUC of 0.870 for the 
MIMIC-IV dataset, an improvement of 0.046 over the pretrain model.
CONCLUSIONS: The proposed pretrain-finetune approach can effectively improve 
model generalizability from one to another dataset in ARDS prediction.

BACKGROUND: Proper analysis and interpretation of health care data can 
significantly improve patient outcomes by enhancing services and revealing the 
impacts of new technologies and treatments. Understanding the substantial impact 
of temporal shifts in these data is crucial. For example, COVID-19 vaccination 
initially lowered the mean age of at-risk patients and later changed the 
characteristics of those who died. This highlights the importance of 
understanding these shifts for assessing factors that affect patient outcomes.
OBJECTIVE: This study aims to propose detection, initial characterization, and 
semantic characterization (DIS), a new methodology for analyzing changes in 
health outcomes and variables over time while discovering contextual changes for 
outcomes in large volumes of data.
METHODS: The DIS methodology involves 3 steps: detection, initial 
characterization, and semantic characterization. Detection uses metrics such as 
Jensen-Shannon divergence to identify significant data drifts. Initial 
characterization offers a global analysis of changes in data distribution and 
predictive feature significance over time. Semantic characterization uses 
natural language processing-inspired techniques to understand the local context 
of these changes, helping identify factors driving changes in patient outcomes. 
By integrating the outcomes from these 3 steps, our results can identify 
specific factors (eg, interventions and modifications in health care practices) 
that drive changes in patient outcomes. DIS was applied to the Brazilian 
COVID-19 Registry and the Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care, version 
IV (MIMIC-IV) data sets.
RESULTS: Our approach allowed us to (1) identify drifts effectively, especially 
using metrics such as the Jensen-Shannon divergence, and (2) uncover reasons for 
the decline in overall mortality in both the COVID-19 and MIMIC-IV data sets, as 
well as changes in the cooccurrence between different diseases and this 
particular outcome. Factors such as vaccination during the COVID-19 pandemic and 
reduced iatrogenic events and cancer-related deaths in MIMIC-IV were 
highlighted. The methodology also pinpointed shifts in patient demographics and 
disease patterns, providing insights into the evolving health care landscape 
during the study period.
CONCLUSIONS: We developed a novel methodology combining machine learning and 
natural language processing techniques to detect, characterize, and understand 
temporal shifts in health care data. This understanding can enhance predictive 
algorithms, improve patient outcomes, and optimize health care resource 
allocation, ultimately improving the effectiveness of machine learning 
predictive algorithms applied to health care data. Our methodology can be 
applied to a variety of scenarios beyond those discussed in this paper.

BACKGROUND: Patients with rare and complex diseases often experience delayed 
diagnoses and misdiagnoses because comprehensive knowledge about these diseases 
is limited to only a few medical experts. In this context, large language models 
(LLMs) have emerged as powerful knowledge aggregation tools with applications in 
clinical decision support and education domains.
OBJECTIVE: This study aims to explore the potential of 3 popular LLMs, namely 
Bard (Google LLC), ChatGPT-3.5 (OpenAI), and GPT-4 (OpenAI), in medical 
education to enhance the diagnosis of rare and complex diseases while 
investigating the impact of prompt engineering on their performance.
METHODS: We conducted experiments on publicly available complex and rare cases 
to achieve these objectives. We implemented various prompt strategies to 
evaluate the performance of these models using both open-ended and 
multiple-choice prompts. In addition, we used a majority voting strategy to 
leverage diverse reasoning paths within language models, aiming to enhance their 
reliability. Furthermore, we compared their performance with the performance of 
human respondents and MedAlpaca, a generative LLM specifically designed for 
medical tasks.
RESULTS: Notably, all LLMs outperformed the average human consensus and 
MedAlpaca, with a minimum margin of 5% and 13%, respectively, across all 30 
cases from the diagnostic case challenge collection. On the frequently 
misdiagnosed cases category, Bard tied with MedAlpaca but surpassed the human 
average consensus by 14%, whereas GPT-4 and ChatGPT-3.5 outperformed MedAlpaca 
and the human respondents on the moderately often misdiagnosed cases category 
with minimum accuracy scores of 28% and 11%, respectively. The majority voting 
strategy, particularly with GPT-4, demonstrated the highest overall score across 
all cases from the diagnostic complex case collection, surpassing that of other 
LLMs. On the Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care-III data sets, Bard and 
GPT-4 achieved the highest diagnostic accuracy scores, with multiple-choice 
prompts scoring 93%, whereas ChatGPT-3.5 and MedAlpaca scored 73% and 47%, 
respectively. Furthermore, our results demonstrate that there is no 
one-size-fits-all prompting approach for improving the performance of LLMs and 
that a single strategy does not universally apply to all LLMs.
CONCLUSIONS: Our findings shed light on the diagnostic capabilities of LLMs and 
the challenges associated with identifying an optimal prompting strategy that 
aligns with each language model's characteristics and specific task 
requirements. The significance of prompt engineering is highlighted, providing 
valuable insights for researchers and practitioners who use these language 
models for medical training. Furthermore, this study represents a crucial step 
toward understanding how LLMs can enhance diagnostic reasoning in rare and 
complex medical cases, paving the way for developing effective educational tools 
and accurate diagnostic aids to improve patient care and outcomes.

BACKGROUND: Sepsis is a significant health burden on a global scale. Timely 
identification and treatment of sepsis can greatly improve patient outcomes, 
including survival rates. However, time-consuming laboratory results are often 
needed for screening sepsis. We aimed to develop a quick sepsis screening tool 
(qSepsis) based on patients' non-laboratory clinical data at the emergency 
department (ED) using machine learning (ML), and compare its performance with 
established clinical scores.
METHODS: This retrospective study included patients admitted to the ED of 
Zhongnan Hospital of Wuhan University (Wuhan, China) from 1/1/2015 to 5/31/2022. 
Patients who were under 18 years of age, had cardiopulmonary arrest upon arrival 
at the ED, or had missing and abnormal medical record data were excluded. The 
qSepsis was derived by three ML algorithms, including logistic regression (LR), 
random forest (RF), and extreme gradient boosting (XGB). To benchmark the 
existing clinical tools for assessing the risk of sepsis in the ED, qSepsis was 
compared with the Systemic Inflammatory Response Syndrome (SIRS), the Quick 
Sepsis-Related Organ Failure Assessment (qSOFA), and the Modified Early Warning 
Score (MEWS). The external validation was performed with the Medical Information 
Mart for Intensive Care IV ED database (United States), and adopted the same 
inclusion and exclusion criteria. The predictive power of qSepsis and other 
clinical scores was measured using the area under the receiver operating 
characteristic curve (AUROC). The primary outcome of the study was the diagnosis 
of sepsis in the ED based on the Sepsis 3.0 criteria, which served as the basis 
for developing the qSepsis tool.
FINDINGS: A total of 414,864 patients were finally included in the cohort 
(median ([IQR]) patient age, 43 (29, 60) years; 202,730 (48.87%) females, 
212,134 (51.13%) males), and 200,089 in the external testing cohort (median (SD) 
patient age, 57 (39, 71) years; 107,427 (53.69%) females, 92,663 (46.31%) 
males). For internal testing, LR outperformed RF and XGB with an AUROC of 0.862 
(95% CI, 0.855-0.869). In external testing, the AUROC decreased to 0.766 (95% 
CI, 0.758-0.774) for LR, 0.725 (95% CI, 0.717-0.733) for RF, and 0.735 (95% CI, 
0.728-0.742) for XGB. In addition, the AUROC for the qSOFA, MEWS, and SIRS 
scores in external validation cohort were 0.579 (95% CI, 0.563-0.596), 0.600 
(95% CI, 0.578-0.622), and 0.704 (95% CI, 0.683-0.725), respectively. The area 
under the precision-recall curve (AUPRC) for the qSepsis model was 0.213 (95% 
CI: 0.204-0.222). The AUPRC values for the other scores were as follows: SIRS, 
0.071 (95% CI: 0.013-0.099); qSOFA, 0.096 (95% CI: 0.003-0.186); and MEWS, 0.083 
(95% CI: 0.063-0.111).
INTERPRETATION: This retrospective study demonstrated that qSepsis had better 
predictive performance in terms of AUROC and area under the precision-recall 
curve (AUPRC) compared to existing assessment scores. It has the potential to be 
used in pre-hospital settings with limited access to laboratory tests and in the 
ED for quick screening of patients with sepsis. However, due to its low positive 
predictive value (PPV), the false alarms may increase in actual clinical 
practice.

OBJECTIVE: To investigate the value of machine learning methods for predicting 
in-hospital mortality in trauma patients with acute respiratory distress 
syndrome (ARDS).
METHODS: A retrospective non-intervention case-control study was performed. 
Trauma patients with ARDS met the Berlin definition were extracted from the the 
Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care III (MIMIC III) database. The basic 
information [including gender, age, body mass index (BMI), pH, oxygenation 
index, laboratory indexes, length of stay in the intensive care unit (ICU), the 
proportion of mechanical ventilation (MV) or continuous renal replacement 
therapy (CRRT), acute physiology score III (APS III), sequential organ failure 
score (SOFA) and simplified acute physiology score II (SAPS II)], complications 
(including hypertension, diabetes, infection, acute hemorrhagic anemia, sepsis, 
shock, acidosis and pneumonia) and prognosis data of patients were collected. 
Multivariate Logistic regression analysis was used to screen meaningful 
variables (P < 0.05). Logistic regression model, XGBoost model and artificial 
neural network model were constructed, and the receiver operator characteristic 
curve (ROC) was performed to evaluate the predictive value of the three models 
for in-hospital mortality in trauma patients with ARDS.
RESULTS: A total of 760 trauma patients with ARDS were enrolled, including 346 
mild cases, 301 moderate cases and 113 severe cases; 618 cases survived and 142 
cases died in hospital; 736 cases received MV and 65 cases received CRRT. 
Multivariate Logistic regression analysis screened out significant variables, 
including age [odds ratio (OR) = 1.035, 95% confidence interval (95%CI) was 
1.020-1.050, P < 0.001], BMI (OR = 0.949, 95%CI was 0.917-0.983, P = 0.003), 
blood urea nitrogen (BUN; OR = 1.019, 95%CI was 1.004-1.033, P = 0.010), lactic 
acid (Lac; OR = 1.213, 95%CI was 1.124-1.309, P < 0.001), red cell volume 
distribution width (RDW; OR = 1.249, 95%CI was 1.102-1.416, P < 0.001), 
hematocrit (HCT, OR = 1.057, 95%CI was 1.019-1.097, P = 0.003), hypertension (OR 
= 0.614, 95%CI was 0.389-0.968, P = 0.036), infection (OR = 0.463, 95%CI was 
0.289-0.741, P = 0.001), acute renal failure (OR = 2.021, 95%CI was 1.267-3.224, 
P = 0.003) and sepsis (OR = 2.105, 95%CI was 1.265-3.502, P = 0.004). All the 
above variables were used to construct the model. Logistic regression model, 
XGBoost model and artificial neural network model predicted in-hospital 
mortality with area under the curve (AUC) of 0.737 (95%CI was 0.659-0.815), 
0.745 (95%CI was 0.672-0.819) and 0.757 (95%CI was 0.680-0.884), respectively. 
There was no significant difference between any two models (all P > 0.05).
CONCLUSIONS: Logistic regression model, XGBoost model and artificial neural 
network model including age, BMI, BUN, Lac, RDW, HCT, hypertension, infection, 
acute renal failure and sepsis have good predictive value for in-hospital 
mortality of trauma patients with ARDS.

BACKGROUND: The β-receptor blocker is used to treat heart failure (HF), and its 
role in the occurrence of atrial fibrillation (AF) is unclear in patients with 
HF. This study aimed to investigate the relationship between β-receptor blocker 
use and AF in patients with HF.
METHODS: All data was collected from the Medical Information Mart for Intensive 
Care-IV (MIMIC-IV) database. The relationship between β-receptor blocker and AF 
was analyzed by univariate logistic regression, multivariate logistic 
regression, and subgroup analysis. The machine learning algorithm including 
logistic and Random forest was used to analyze the importance of variables in 
AF. The interaction analysis was conducted to determine whether other factors 
influence the relationship between β-receptor blocker and AF.
RESULTS: A total of 953 participants were involved. We found that the use of 
beta-blockers increased the risk of AF this result was not affected by 
confounding factors (OR (95%CI): 2.821[2.014,3.951], p < 0.01). The interaction 
analysis showed that myocardial infarction (MI) and β-receptor blocker had an 
interaction on AF (p for interaction < 0.001). The results of additive and 
multiplicative interaction analysis indicated that β-receptor-blocker use and 
infarction are antagonistic in the development of AF in patients with HF ((S 
(95% CI): 0.283[0.142, 0.563]; AP (95% CI): -1.187[-2.020, -0.354]; RERI (95% 
CI): -2.237[-3.722, -0.752], OR (95% CI):0.374[0.184, 0.772]).
CONCLUSION: This study found that β-receptor blocker use was an important risk 
factor for AF in patients with HF. β-receptor blocker use was antagonistic to MI 
in AF in patients with HF.

BACKGROUND: Simple and rapid tools for screening high-risk patients for 
perioperative neurocognitive disorders (PNDs) are urgently needed to improve 
patient outcomes. We developed an online tool with machine-learning algorithms 
using routine variables based on multicenter data.
METHODS: The entire dataset was composed of 49,768 surgical patients from 3 
representative academic hospitals in China. Surgical patients older than 45 
years, those undergoing general anesthesia, and those without a history of PND 
were enrolled. When the patient's discharge diagnosis was PND, the patient was 
in the PND group. Patients in the non-PND group were randomly extracted from the 
big data platform according to the surgical type, age, and source of data in the 
PND group with a ratio of 3:1. After data preprocessing and feature selection, 
general linear model (GLM), artificial neural network (ANN), and naive Bayes 
(NB) were used for model development and evaluation. Model performance was 
evaluated by the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve 
(ROCAUC), the area under the precision-recall curve (PRAUC), the Brier score, 
the index of prediction accuracy (IPA), sensitivity, specificity, etc. The model 
was also externally validated on the multiparameter intelligent monitoring in 
intensive care (MIMIC) Ⅳ database. Afterward, we developed an online 
visualization tool to preoperatively predict patients' risk of developing PND 
based on the models with the best performance.
RESULTS: A total of 1051 patients (242 PND and 809 non-PND) and 2884 patients 
(6.2% patients with PND) were analyzed on multicenter data (model development, 
test [internal validation], external validation-1) and MIMIC Ⅳ dataset (external 
validation-2). The model performance based on GLM was much better than that 
based on ANN and NB. The best-performing GLM model on validation-1 dataset 
achieved ROCAUC (0.874; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.833-0.915), PRAUC 
(0.685; 95% CI, 0.584-0.786), sensitivity (72.6%; 95% CI, 61.4%-81.5%), 
specificity (84.4%; 95% CI, 79.3%-88.4%), Brier score (0.131), and IPA (44.7%), 
and of which the ROCAUC (0.761, 95% CI, 0.712-0.809), the PRAUC (0.475, 95% CI, 
0.370-0.581), Brier score (0.053), and IPA (76.8%) on validation-2 dataset. 
Afterward, we developed an online tool 
(https://pnd-predictive-model-dynnom.shinyapps.io/ DynNomapp/) with 10 routine 
variables for preoperatively screening high-risk patients.
CONCLUSIONS: We developed a simple and rapid online tool to preoperatively 
screen patients' risk of PND using GLM based on multicenter data, which may help 
medical staff's decision-making regarding perioperative management strategies to 
improve patient outcomes.

BACKGROUND: Sepsis is a leading cause of mortality in intensive care units and 
vasoactive drugs are widely used in septic patients. The cardiovascular response 
of septic shock patients during resuscitation therapies and the relationship of 
the cardiovascular response and clinical outcome has not been clearly described.
METHODS: We included adult patients admitted to the ICU with sepsis from Peking 
Union Medical College Hospital (internal), Medical Information Mart for 
Intensive Care IV (MIMIC-IV) and eICU Collaborative Research Database 
(eICU-CRD). The Blood Pressure Response Index (BPRI) was defined as the ratio 
between the mean arterial pressure and the vasoactive-inotropic score. BRRI was 
compared with existing risk scores on predicting in-hospital death. The 
relationship between BPRI and in-hospital mortality was calculated. A XGBoost's 
machine learning model identified the features that influence short-term changes 
in BPRI.
FINDINGS: There were 2139, 9455, and 4202 patients in the internal, MIMIC-IV and 
eICU-CRD cohorts, respectively. BPRI had a better AUROC for predicting 
in-hospital mortality than SOFA (0.78 vs. 0.73, p = 0.01) and APS (0.78 vs. 
0.74, p = 0.03) in the internal cohort. The estimated odds ratio for death per 
unit decrease in BPRI was 1.32 (95% CI 1.20-1.45) when BPRI was below 7.1 vs. 
0.99 (95% CI 0.97-1.01) when BPRI was above 7.1 in the internal cohort; similar 
relationships were found in MIMIC-IV and eICU-CRD. Respiratory support and 
latest cumulative 12-h fluid balance were intervention-related features 
influencing BPRI.
INTERPRETATION: BPRI is an easy, rapid, precise indicator of the response of 
patients with septic shock to vasoactive drugs. It is a comparable and even 
better predictor of prognosis than SOFA and APS in sepsis and it is simpler and 
more convenient in use. The application of BPRI could help clinicians identify 
potentially at-risk patients and provide clues for treatment.

BACKGROUND: The development of acute kidney injury (AKI) during an intensive 
care unit (ICU) admission is associated with increased morbidity and mortality.
METHODS: Our objective was to develop and validate a data driven multivariable 
clinical predictive model for early detection of AKI among a large cohort of 
adult critical care patients. We utilized data form the Medical Information Mart 
for Intensive Care III (MIMIC-III) for all patients who had a creatinine 
measured for 3 days following ICU admission and excluded patients with 
pre-existing condition of Chronic Kidney Disease and Acute Kidney Injury on 
admission. Data extracted included patient age, gender, ethnicity, creatinine, 
other vital signs and lab values during the first day of ICU admission, whether 
the patient was mechanically ventilated during the first day of ICU admission, 
and the hourly rate of urine output during the first day of ICU admission.
RESULTS: Utilizing the demographics, the clinical data and the laboratory test 
measurements from Day 1 of ICU admission, we accurately predicted max serum 
creatinine level during Day 2 and Day 3 with a root mean square error of 
0.224 mg/dL. We demonstrated that using machine learning models (multivariate 
logistic regression, random forest and artificial neural networks) with 
demographics and physiologic features can predict AKI onset as defined by the 
current clinical guideline with a competitive AUC (mean AUC 0.783 by our 
all-feature, logistic-regression model), while previous models aimed at more 
specific patient cohorts.
CONCLUSIONS: Experimental results suggest that our model has the potential to 
assist clinicians in identifying patients at greater risk of new onset of AKI in 
critical care setting. Prospective trials with independent model training and 
external validation cohorts are needed to further evaluate the clinical utility 
of this approach and potentially instituting interventions to decrease the 
likelihood of developing AKI.

BACKGROUND: We determined utilizing a sepsis participant cohort whether there is 
a significant association between TyG-BMI (triglyceride glucose body mass index) 
and mortality rates at any stage.
METHODS: Herein, a historical cohort investigation approach was adopted, using 
information provided by the Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care-IV 
(MIMIC-IV). We categorized the included individuals in accordance with their 
TyG-BMI data quartiles, and the primary outcomes were mortality during the 
hospital stay and death rate due to any reason at postadmission day 28, 90, and 
365. To evaluate TyG-BMI mortality's relationship with sepsis-induced mortality 
risk, we employed restricted cubic spline regression (RCS) and Cox regression 
models. Additionally, we confirmed TyG-BMI's significant predictive value for 
mortality via machine learning methods. Furthermore, we performed subgroup 
analyses to investigate possible differences among various patient groups.
RESULTS: The cohort included 4759 individuals, aged 63.9 ± 15.0 years, involving 
2885 males (60.6%). The rates of death that took place during hospital stay and 
at 28, 90 and 365 days postadmission were respectively 19.60%, 24.70%, 28.80%, 
and 35.20%. As reflected by Cox models, TyG-BMI was negatively associated with 
mortality risk at various intervals: in-hospital [hazard ratio (HR) 0.47 
(0.39-0.56), P = 0.003], 28 days postadmission [HR 0.42 (0.35-0.49), P < 0.001], 
90 days postadmission [HR 0.41 (0.35-0.48), P < 0.001], and 365 days 
postadmission [HR 0.41 (0.35-0.47), P < 0.001]. Additionally, the relationship 
between TyG-BMI and death rates was L-shaped, as reflected by the RCS, with a 
TyG-BMI of 249 being the turning point.
CONCLUSIONS: Among sepsis patients in critical care, TyG-BMI is negatively 
correlated with mortality possibility at various intervals: during hospital stay 
and 28 days, 90 days, and one year postadmission. TyG-BMI is a beneficial 
parameter for categorizing risk levels among sepsis patients and for predicting 
their mortality risk within one year.

OBJECTIVES: The application of natural language processing (NLP) in the clinical 
domain is important due to the rich unstructured information in clinical 
documents, which often remains inaccessible in structured data. When applying 
NLP methods to a certain domain, the role of benchmark datasets is crucial as 
benchmark datasets not only guide the selection of best-performing models but 
also enable the assessment of the reliability of the generated outputs. Despite 
the recent availability of language models capable of longer context, benchmark 
datasets targeting long clinical document classification tasks are absent.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: To address this issue, we propose Long Clinical Document 
(LCD) benchmark, a benchmark for the task of predicting 30-day out-of-hospital 
mortality using discharge notes of Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care 
IV and statewide death data. We evaluated this benchmark dataset using baseline 
models, from bag-of-words and convolutional neural network to instruction-tuned 
large language models. Additionally, we provide a comprehensive analysis of the 
model outputs, including manual review and visualization of model weights, to 
offer insights into their predictive capabilities and limitations.
RESULTS: Baseline models showed 28.9% for best-performing supervised models and 
32.2% for GPT-4 in F1 metrics. Notes in our dataset have a median word count of 
1687.
DISCUSSION: Our analysis of the model outputs showed that our dataset is 
challenging for both models and human experts, but the models can find 
meaningful signals from the text.
CONCLUSION: We expect our LCD benchmark to be a resource for the development of 
advanced supervised models, or prompting methods, tailored for clinical text.

OBJECTIVE: To establish an acute kidney injury (AKI) prediction model in 
patients after cardiac surgery by extreme gradient boosting (XGBoost) machine 
learning model, and to explore the risk and protective factors for AKI in 
patients after cardiac surgery.
METHODS: All patients who underwent cardiac surgery in Medical Information Mart 
for Intensive Care-III (MIMIC-III) database were enrolled, and they were divided 
into AKI group and non-AKI group according to whether AKI developed within 14 
days after cardiac surgery. Their clinical characteristics were compared. Based 
on five-fold cross-validation, XGBoost and Logistic regression were used to 
establish the prediction model of AKI after cardiac surgery. And the area under 
the receiver operator characteristic curve (AUC) of the models was compared. The 
output model of XGBoost was interpreted by Shapley additive explanations (SHAP).
RESULTS: A total of 6 912 patients were included, of which 5 681 (82.2%) 
developed AKI within 14 days after the operation, and 1 231 (17.8%) did not. 
Compared with the non-AKI group, the main characteristics of AKI group included 
older age [years: 68.0 (59.0, 76.0) vs. 62.0 (52.0, 71.0)], higher incidence of 
emergency admission and complicated with obesity and diabetes (52.4% vs. 47.8%, 
9.0% vs. 4.0%, 32.0% vs. 22.2%), lower respiratory rate [RR; bpm: times/min: 
17.0 (14.0, 20.0) vs. 19.0 (15.0, 22.0)], lower heart rate [HR; bpm: 80.0 (67.0, 
89.0) vs. 82.0 (71.5, 93.0)], higher blood pressure [mmHg (1 mmHg ≈ 0.133 kPa): 
80.0 (70.7, 90.0) vs. 78.0 (70.0, 88.0)], higher hemoglobin (Hb), blood glucose, 
blood K+ level and serum creatinine [SCr; Hb (g/L): 122.0 (109.0, 136.0) vs. 
120.0 (106.0, 135.0), blood glucose (mmol/L): 7.3 (6.1, 8.9) vs. 6.8 (5.7, 8.5), 
blood K+ level (mmol/L): 4.2 (3.9, 4.7) vs. 4.2 (3.8, 4.6), SCr (μmol/L): 88.4 
(70.7, 106.1) vs. 79.6 (70.7, 97.2)], lower albumin (ALB) and triacylglycerol 
[TG; ALB (g/L): 38.0 (35.0, 41.0) vs. 39.0 (37.0, 42.0), TG (mmol/L): 1.4 (1.0, 
2.0) vs. 1.5 (1.0, 2.2)] as well as higher incidence of multiple organ 
dysfunction syndrome (MODS) and sepsis (30.6% vs. 16.2%, 3.3% vs. 1.9%), with 
significant differences (all P < 0.05). In the output model of Logistic 
regression, important predictors were lactic acid [Lac; odds ratio (OR) = 1.062, 
95% confidence interval (95%CI) was 1.030-1.100, P = 0.005], obesity (OR = 
2.234, 95%CI was 1.900-2.640, P < 0.001), male (OR = 0.858, 95%CI was 
0.794-0.928, P = 0.049), diabetes (OR = 1.820, 95%CI was 1.680-1.980, P < 0.001) 
and emergency admission (OR = 1.278, 95%CI was 1.190-1.380, P < 0.001). Receiver 
operator characteristic curve (ROC curve) analysis showed that the AUC of the 
Logistic regression model for predicting AKI after cardiac surgery was 0.62 
(95%CI was 0.61-0.67). After optimizing the XGBoost model parameters by grid 
search combined with five-fold cross-validation, the model was trained well with 
no overfitting or overfitting. ROC analysis showed that the AUC of XGBoost model 
for predicting AKI after cardiac surgery was 0.77 (95%CI was 0.75-0.80), which 
was significantly higher than that of Logistic regression model (P < 0.01). 
After SHAP treatment, in the output model of XGBoost, age and ALB were the most 
important predictors of the final outcome, where age was the risk factor 
(average |SHAP value| was 0.434), and ALB was the protective factor (average 
|SHAP value| was 0.221).
CONCLUSIONS: Age is an important risk factor for AKI after cardiac surgery, and 
ALB is a protective factor. The performance of machine learning in predicting 
cardiac and vascular surgery-associated AKI is better than the traditional 
Logistic regression. XGBoost can analyze the more complex relationship between 
variables and outcomes, and can predict the risk of postoperative AKI more 
accurately and individually.

BACKGROUND: Septic shock patients fundamentally require delicate vasoactive and 
inotropic agent administration, which could be quantitatively and objectively 
evaluated by the vasoactive-inotropic score (VIS); however, whether the dynamic 
trends of high-time-resolution VIS alter the clinical outcomes remains unclear. 
Thus, this study proposes the term VIS Reduction Rate (VRR) to generalise the 
tendency of dynamic VIS, to explore the association of VRR and mortality for 
patients with septic shock.
METHODS: We applied dynamic and static VIS data to predict ICU mortality by two 
models: the long short-term memory (LSTM) deep learning model, and the extreme 
gradient boosting (XGBoost), respectively. The specific target cohort was 
extracted from the Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care IV (MIMIC-IV) 
database by the sophisticated structured query language (SQL). Enrolled patients 
were divided into four groups by VRR value: ≥50%, 0 ~ 50%, -50% ~ 0, and < -50%. 
Statistical approaches included pairwise propensity score matching (PSM), Cox 
proportional hazards regression, and two doubly robust estimation models to 
ensure the robustness of the results. The primary and secondary outcomes were 
ICU mortality and in-hospital mortality, respectively.
RESULTS: VRR simplifies the dosing trends of vasoactive and inotropic agents 
represented by dynamic VIS data while requiring fewer data. In total, 8,887 
septic shock patients were included. Compared with the VRR ≥50% group, the 
0 ~ 50%, -50% ~ 0, and < -50% groups had significantly higher ICU mortality 
[hazard ratio (HR) 1.32, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.17-1.50, p < 0.001; HR 
1.79, 95% CI 1.44-2.22, p < 0.001; HR 2.07, 95% CI 1.61-2.66, p < 0.001, 
respectively] and in-hospital mortality [HR 1.43, 95% CI 1.28-1.60, p < 0.001; 
HR 1.75, 95% CI 1.45-2.11, p < 0.001; HR 2.00, 95% CI 1.61-2.49, p < 0.001, 
respectively]. Similar findings were observed in two doubly robust estimation 
models.
CONCLUSION: The trends of dynamic VIS in ICU might help intensivists to stratify 
the prognosis of adult patients with septic shock. A lower decline of VIS was 
remarkably associated with higher ICU and in-hospital mortality among septic 
shock patients receiving vasoactive-inotropic therapy for more than 24 h.

On average, more than 5 million patients are admitted to intensive care units 
(ICUs) in the US, with mortality rates ranging from 10 to 29%. The acuity state 
of patients in the ICU can quickly change from stable to unstable, sometimes 
leading to life-threatening conditions. Early detection of deteriorating 
conditions can assist in more timely interventions and improved survival rates. 
While Artificial Intelligence (AI)-based models show potential for assessing 
acuity in a more granular and automated manner, they typically use mortality as 
a proxy of acuity in the ICU. Furthermore, these methods do not determine the 
acuity state of a patient (i.e., stable or unstable), the transition between 
acuity states, or the need for life-sustaining therapies. In this study, we 
propose APRICOT-M (Acuity Prediction in Intensive Care Unit-Mamba), a 
1M-parameter state space-based neural network to predict acuity state, 
transitions, and the need for life-sustaining therapies in real-time among ICU 
patients. The model integrates ICU data in the preceding four hours (including 
vital signs, laboratory results, assessment scores, and medications) and patient 
characteristics (age, sex, race, and comorbidities) to predict the acuity 
outcomes in the next four hours. Our state space-based model can process sparse 
and irregularly sampled data without manual imputation, thus reducing the noise 
in input data and increasing inference speed. The model was trained on data from 
107,473 patients (142,062 ICU admissions) from 55 hospitals between 2014-2017 
and validated externally on data from 74,901 patients (101,356 ICU admissions) 
from 143 hospitals. Additionally, it was validated temporally on data from 
12,927 patients (15,940 ICU admissions) from one hospital in 2018-2019 and 
prospectively on data from 215 patients (369 ICU admissions) from one hospital 
in 2021-2023. Three datasets were used for training and evaluation: the 
University of Florida Health (UFH) dataset, the electronic ICU Collaborative 
Research Database (eICU), and the Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care 
(MIMIC)-IV dataset. APRICOT-M significantly outperforms the baseline acuity 
assessment, Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (SOFA), for mortality prediction 
in both external (AUROC 0.95 CI: 0.94-0.95 compared to 0.78 CI: 0.78-0.79) and 
prospective (AUROC 0.99 CI: 0.97-1.00 compared to 0.80 CI: 0.65-0.92) cohorts, 
as well as for instability prediction (external AUROC 0.75 CI: 0.74-0.75 
compared to 0.51 CI: 0.51-0.51, and prospective AUROC 0.69 CI: 0.64-0.74 
compared to 0.53 CI: 0.50-0.57). This tool has the potential to help clinicians 
make timely interventions by predicting the transition between acuity states and 
decision-making on life-sustaining within the next four hours in the ICU.

BACKGROUND: Intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH) is associated with high mortality and 
morbidity rates. Although some studies have indicated a correlation between 
serum bilirubin levels and ICH severity, evidence of the relationship between 
serum total bilirubin (TBIL) and ICH outcomes remains lacking.
METHODS: A total of 914 patients from the Medical Information Mart for Intensive 
Care IV database met the eligibility criteria and were included in the study. 
The patients were categorized into two groups based on whether they survived for 
28 days following admission to hospital. The association between serum TBIL 
levels and 28-day survival in patients with ICH was investigated using 
Spearman's correlation analysis and restricted cubic splines. The effect of 
serum TBIL levels on survival time and rate in the 28-day period was analyzed 
using Kaplan-Meier curves and restricted mean survival times. Univariate Cox 
regression, least absolute shrinkage and selection operator regression, and 
multivariate Cox regression were used to identify risk factors associated with 
28-day all-cause mortality. Finally, subgroup analysis was performed to verify 
the stability of the association between serum TBIL levels and 28-day all-cause 
mortality in patients with ICH.
RESULTS: A negative relationship was revealed between TBIL levels and survival 
(p < 0.001, correlation = -0.174). Restricted cubic spline analysis revealed a 
nonlinear link between mean serum TBIL levels and 28-day all-cause mortality (p 
for nonlinear = 0.001). Patients with ICH and higher serum TBIL levels had 
significantly reduced survival times and rates compared with those with lower 
serum TBIL levels (p < 0.001). Serum TBIL level was identified as a significant 
risk factor for 28-day all-cause mortality in patients with ICH (hazard ratio 
[95% confidence interval] = 1.121 [1.063-1.182], p < 0.001). Subgroup analyses 
revealed that the assessed variables had no influence on the association between 
serum TBIL levels and 28-day all-cause mortality.
CONCLUSION: Higher serum TBIL levels are associated with a greater risk of 
mortality within 28 days in patients with ICH, whereas lower serum TBIL levels 
are associated with prolonged survival.

OBJECTIVE: Heart rate serves as a critical prognostic factor in heart failure 
(HF) patients. We hypothesise that elevated heart rate in critically ill HF 
patients on discharge from the intensive care unit (ICU) could be linked to 
adverse outcomes.
DESIGN: A single-centre retrospective cohort study.
SETTING: This study used data collected between 2008 and 2019 from the Medical 
Information Mart for Intensive Care IV (V.2.0) Database.
PARTICIPANTS: From the 76 943 ICU stays, we enrolled 2365 patients in this 
study.
PRIMARY AND SECONDARY OUTCOME MEASURES: We observed correlations between 
in-hospital mortality and ICU discharge heart rate of 83.56±15.81 beats per 
minute (bpm) (survivors) vs 93.84±17.28 bpm (non-survivors, p<0.001). Total 
mortality showed similar trends, with 83.67±15.36 bpm (survivors) vs 
85.23±17.25 bpm (non-survivors, p=0.027), as did ICU readmissions at 
83.55±15.77 bpm (non-readmitted) vs 88.64±17.49 bpm (readmitted, p<0.001).
RESULTS: Given multivariate analysis, the ICU discharge heart rate strongly 
predicted in-hospital mortality (HR 1.032 (95% CI 1.022 to 1.041), p<0.001), 
total mortality (HR 1.008 (95% CI 1.004 to 1.013), p<0.001) and ICU readmission 
(HR 1.018 (95% CI 1.010 to 1.025), p<0.001). Patients with an ICU discharge 
heart rate>90 bpm demonstrated significantly higher in-hospital mortality (HR 
2.639 (95% CI 1.898 to 3.669), p<0.001), total mortality (HR 1.342 (95% CI 1.163 
to 1.550), p<0.001) and ICU readmission rates (HR 1.781 (95% CI 1.413 to 2.243), 
p<0.001).
CONCLUSION: The findings suggest that HF patients with an elevated heart rate 
(>90 bpm) at ICU discharge are more likely to experience increased in-hospital 
mortality, total mortality and ICU readmissions, indicating potential negative 
outcomes.
