BACKGROUND: The triglyceride glucose-body mass (TyG-BMI) index is acknowledged 
as both a reliable indicator of the risk of cardiovascular disease and an 
accurate surrogate biomarker for evaluating insulin resistance (IR). The 
importance of the TyG-BMI index among people with heart failure (HF), however, 
requires more investigation. The objective of this study was to inquire about 
the relationship between HF patients' TyG-BMI index and their risk of 360-day 
mortality.
METHODS: The Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care (MIMIC-IV) database 
provided the study's patient data, which were divided into quartiles according 
to their TyG-BMI index. The endpoint was mortality from all causes within 360 
days. Kaplan-Meier analysis was used to compare this primary endpoint amongst 
the four groups indicated above. The association between the TyG-BMI index and 
the endpoint was investigated using restricted cubic splines and Cox 
proportional hazards analysis.
RESULTS: The study enrolled a total of 423 patients with HF (59.2% male), of 
whom 70 patients (16.9%) died within 360 days. Patients with higher TyG-BMI 
indexes had significantly lower mortality risks, according to the Kaplan-Meier 
analysis (log-rank P = 0.003). Furthermore, the restricted cubic spline analysis 
illustrated a decrease in the risk of all-cause mortality with an increasing 
TyG-BMI index. Additionally, multivariable Cox proportional hazards analyses 
showed that the risk of 360-day death from all causes was considerably higher in 
the lowest quartile of TyG-BMI. In comparison to the lowest TyG-BMI group, the 
fully adjusted Cox model yielded a hazard ratio (HR) of 0.24 (95% CI: 0.10, 
0.59; p = 0.002) for 360-day mortality.
CONCLUSIONS: In patients diagnosed with HF, a lower TyG-BMI index is strongly 
related to a higher risk of 360-day mortality. This index can be employed to 
categorize the risk levels of patients with HF and predict their one-year 
all-cause mortality .

BACKGROUND: Platelets play a critical role in hemostasis and inflammatory 
diseases. Low platelet count and activity have been reported to be associated 
with unfavorable prognosis. This study aims to explore the relationship between 
dynamics in platelet count and in-hospital morality among septic patients and to 
provide real-time updates on mortality risk to achieve dynamic prediction.
METHODS: We conducted a multi-cohort, retrospective, observational study that 
encompasses data on septic patients in the eICU Collaborative Research Database 
(eICU-CRD) and the Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care IV (MIMIC-IV) 
database. The joint latent class model (JLCM) was utilized to identify 
heterogenous platelet count trajectories over time among septic patients. We 
assessed the association between different trajectory patterns and 28-day 
in-hospital mortality using a piecewise Cox hazard model within each trajectory. 
We evaluated the performance of our dynamic prediction model through area under 
the receiver operating characteristic curve, concordance index (C-index), 
accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity calculated at predefined time points.
RESULTS: Four subgroups of platelet count trajectories were identified that 
correspond to distinct in-hospital mortality risk. Including platelet count did 
not significantly enhance prediction accuracy at early stages (day 1 
C-indexDynamic  vs C-indexWeibull: 0.713 vs 0.714). However, our model showed 
superior performance to the static survival model over time (day 14 
C-indexDynamic  vs C-indexWeibull: 0.644 vs 0.617).
CONCLUSIONS: For septic patients in an intensive care unit, the rapid decline in 
platelet counts is a critical prognostic factor, and serial platelet measures 
are associated with prognosis.

Purpose: By analyzing the clinical characteristics, etiological characteristics 
and commonly used antibiotics of patients with ventilator-associated pneumonia 
(VAP) in intensive care units (ICUs) in the intensive care database. This study 
aims to provide guidance information for the clinical rational use of drugs for 
patients with VAP. Method: Patients with VAP information were collected from the 
Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care IV (MIMIC-IV) database, including 
their sociodemographic characteristics, vital signs, laboratory measurements, 
complications, microbiology, and antibiotic use. After data processing, the 
characteristics of the medications used by patients with VAP in ICUs were 
described using statistical graphs and tables, and experiences were summarized 
and the reasons were analyzed. Results: This study included 2,068 patients with 
VAP. Forty-eight patient characteristics, including demographic indicators, 
vital signs, biochemical indicators, scores, and comorbidities, were compared 
between the survival and death groups of VAP patients. Cephalosporins and 
vancomycin were the most commonly used. Among them, fourth-generation 
cephalosporin (ForGC) combined with vancomycin was used the most, by 540 
patients. First-generati49n cephalosporin (FirGC) combined with vancomycin was 
associated with the highest survival rate (86.7%). More than 55% of patients 
were infected with Gram-negative bacteria. However, patients with VAP had fewer 
resistant strains (<25%). FirGC or ForGC combined with vancomycin had many 
inflammation-related features that differed significantly from those in patients 
who did not receive medication. Conclusion: Understanding antibiotic use, 
pathogenic bacteria compositions, and the drug resistance rates of patients with 
VAP can help prevent the occurrence of diseases, contain infections as soon as 
possible, and promote the recovery of patients.

BACKGROUND: Hemorrhagic stroke (HS), including non-traumatic intracerebral 
hemorrhage (ICH) and subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH), constitutes a substantial 
proportion of cerebrovascular incidents, accounting for around 30% of stroke 
cases. The triglyceride-glucose index (TyG-i) represents a precise insulin 
resistance (IR) indicator, a crucial metabolic disturbance. Existing literature 
has demonstrated an association between TyG-i and all-cause mortality (ACM) 
among individuals suffering from ischemic stroke (IS). Yet, the TyG-i prognostic 
implications for severe HS patients necessitating intensive care unit (ICU) 
admission are not clearly understood. Considering the notably elevated mortality 
and morbidity associated with HS relative to IS, investigating this association 
is warranted. Our primary aim was to investigate TyG-i and ACM association among 
critically ill HS patients within an ICU context.
METHODS: Herein, patients with severe HS were identified by accessing the 
Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care-IV (MIMIC-IV, version 2.2) database, 
using the International Classification of Diseases (ICD)-9/10 as diagnostic 
guidelines. Subsequently, we stratified the subjects into quartiles, relying on 
their TyG-i scores. Moreover, we measured mortality at ICU, in-hospital, 30 
days, 90 days, and 1 year as the outcomes. Cox proportional hazards regression 
analysis and restricted cubic splines (RCS) were deployed for elucidating the 
relation between the TyG-i and ACM while utilizing the Kaplan-Meier (K-M) method 
to estimate survival curves. The findings' robustness was assessed by conducting 
subgroup analysis and interaction tests employing likelihood ratio tests.
RESULTS: The analysis included 1475 patients, with a male predominance of 54.4%. 
Observed mortality rates in the ICU, hospital, 30 days, 90 days, and 1 year were 
7.3%, 10.9%, 13.8%, 19.7%, and 27.3%, respectively. Multivariate Cox regression 
analysis results manifested that heightened TyG-i was significantly related to 
ACM at 30 days (adjusted hazard ratio [aHR]: 1.32; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 
1.05-1.67; P = 0.020), 90 days (aHR: 1.27; 95% CI: 1.04-1.55; P = 0.019), and 1 
year (aHR: 1.22; 95% CI: 1.03-1.44; P = 0.023). The results of RCS analysis 
demonstrated a progressive elevation in ACM risk with rising TyG-i levels. 
Interaction tests found no significant effect modification in this relationship.
CONCLUSION: In summary, TyG-i exhibits a significant correlation with ACM among 
patients enduring critical illness due to HS. This correlation underscores the 
probable utility of TyG-i as a prognostic tool for stratifying HS patients 
according to their risk of mortality. Applying TyG-i in clinical settings could 
enhance therapeutic decision-making and the management of disease trajectories. 
Additionally, this investigation augments existing research on the linkage 
between the TyG-i and IS, elucidating the TyG-i's role in predicting mortality 
across diverse stroke categories.

BACKGROUND: Triglyceride-glucose (TyG) index as a reliable surrogate of insulin 
resistance (IR) has been shown to be related to adverse clinical outcomes in 
patients with acute coronary syndrome, heart failure, ischemic stroke and so on. 
However, the relationship between TyG index and all-cause mortality in intensive 
care unit (ICU) patients remains unknown. The purpose of this study was to 
investigate the correlation between TyG index and all-cause mortality to 
evaluate the impact of IR on the prognosis of this population.
METHODS: This was a retrospective observational study that included 3026 
patients who had an initial triglyceride and glucose data on the first day of 
ICU admission, and all data were extracted from the Medical Information Mart for 
Intensive Care III (MIMIC-III) database. These patients were grouped into 
quartiles (Q1-Q4) according to TyG index. The Kaplan-Meier analysis was used to 
compare all-cause mortality among the above four groups. Cox proportional 
hazards analyses were performed to examine the association between TyG index and 
all-cause mortality.
RESULTS: During 10.46 years of follow-up, 1148 (37.9%) patients died, of which 
350 (11.6%) occurred during the hospital stay and 258 (8.5%) occurred during the 
ICU stay. Kaplan-Meier analysis showed that the risk of all-cause mortality was 
significantly higher in patients with higher TyG index (log-rank P = 0.021). 
Multivariable Cox proportional hazards analyses showed that the TyG index was an 
independent risk predictor of ICU death (HR: 1.72, 95% CI 1.18-2.52, P = 0.005) 
and hospital death (HR: 2.19, 95% CI 1.59-3.03, P < 0.001), and each 1-unit 
increased in the TyG index, a 1.19-fold increase in the risk of death during the 
hospital stay.
CONCLUSIONS: TyG index is strongly related to the all-cause mortality increasing 
in critically ill patients. This finding indicates that the TyG index might be 
useful in identifying people at high risk of ICU death and hospital death.

BACKGROUND: Current classification for acute kidney injury (AKI) in critically 
ill patients with sepsis relies only on its severity-measured by maximum 
creatinine which overlooks inherent complexities and longitudinal evaluation of 
this heterogenous syndrome. The role of classification of AKI based on early 
creatinine trajectories is unclear.
METHODS: This retrospective study identified patients with Sepsis-3 who 
developed AKI within 48-h of intensive care unit admission using Medical 
Information Mart for Intensive Care-IV database. We used latent class mixed 
modelling to identify early creatinine trajectory-based classes of AKI in 
critically ill patients with sepsis. Our primary outcome was development of 
acute kidney disease (AKD). Secondary outcomes were composite of AKD or 
all-cause in-hospital mortality by day 7, and AKD or all-cause in-hospital 
mortality by hospital discharge. We used multivariable regression to assess 
impact of creatinine trajectory-based classification on outcomes, and eICU 
database for external validation.
RESULTS: Among 4197 patients with AKI in critically ill patients with sepsis, we 
identified eight creatinine trajectory-based classes with distinct 
characteristics. Compared to the class with transient AKI, the class that showed 
severe AKI with mild improvement but persistence had highest adjusted risks for 
developing AKD (OR 5.16; 95% CI 2.87-9.24) and composite 7-day outcome (HR 4.51; 
95% CI 2.69-7.56). The class that demonstrated late mild AKI with persistence 
and worsening had highest risks for developing composite hospital discharge 
outcome (HR 2.04; 95% CI 1.41-2.94). These associations were similar on external 
validation.
CONCLUSIONS: These 8 classes of AKI in critically ill patients with sepsis, 
stratified by early creatinine trajectories, were good predictors for key 
outcomes in patients with AKI in critically ill patients with sepsis independent 
of their AKI staging.

BACKGROUND: The triglyceride-glucose (TyG) index, a tool for assessing insulin 
resistance, is increasingly recognized for its ability to predict cardiovascular 
and metabolic risks. However, its relationship with trauma and surgical patient 
prognosis is understudied. This study investigated the correlation between the 
TyG index and mortality risk in surgical/trauma ICU patients to identify 
high-risk individuals and improve prognostic strategies.
METHODS: This study identified patients requiring trauma/surgical ICU admission 
from the Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care (MIMIC-IV) database, and 
divided them into tertiles based on the TyG index. The outcomes included 28-day 
mortality and 180-day mortality for short-term and long-term prognosis. The 
associations between the TyG index and clinical outcomes in patients were 
elucidated using Cox proportional hazards regression analysis and RCS models.
RESULTS: A total of 2103 patients were enrolled. The 28-day mortality and 
180-day mortality rates reached 18% and 24%, respectively. Multivariate Cox 
proportional hazards analysis revealed that an elevated TyG index was 
significantly related to 28-day and 180-day mortality after covariates 
adjusting. An elevated TyG index was significantly associated with 28-day 
mortality (adjusted hazard ratio, 1.19; 95% confidence interval 1.04-1.37) and 
180-day mortality (adjusted hazard ratio, 1.24; 95% confidence interval 
1.11-1.39). RCS models revealed that a progressively increasing risk of 
mortality was related to an elevated TyG index. According to our subgroup 
analysis, an elevated TyG index is associated with increased risk of 28-day and 
180-day mortality in critically ill patients younger than 60 years old, as well 
as those with concomitant stroke or cardiovascular diseases. Additionally, in 
nondiabetic patients, an elevated TyG index is associated with 180-day 
mortality.
CONCLUSION: An increasing risk of mortality was related to an elevated TyG 
index. In critically ill patients younger than 60 years old, as well as those 
with concomitant stroke or cardiovascular diseases, an elevated TyG index is 
associated with adverse short-term and long-term outcomes. Furthermore, in 
non-diabetic patients, an elevated TyG index is associated with adverse 
long-term prognosis.

OBJECTIVES: Sepsis is among the leading causes of morbidity, mortality, and cost 
overruns in critically ill patients. Early intervention with antibiotics 
improves survival in septic patients. However, no clinically validated system 
exists for real-time prediction of sepsis onset. We aimed to develop and 
validate an Artificial Intelligence Sepsis Expert algorithm for early prediction 
of sepsis.
DESIGN: Observational cohort study.
SETTING: Academic medical center from January 2013 to December 2015.
PATIENTS: Over 31,000 admissions to the ICUs at two Emory University hospitals 
(development cohort), in addition to over 52,000 ICU patients from the publicly 
available Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care-III ICU database 
(validation cohort). Patients who met the Third International Consensus 
Definitions for Sepsis (Sepsis-3) prior to or within 4 hours of their ICU 
admission were excluded, resulting in roughly 27,000 and 42,000 patients within 
our development and validation cohorts, respectively.
INTERVENTIONS: None.
MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: High-resolution vital signs time series and 
electronic medical record data were extracted. A set of 65 features (variables) 
were calculated on hourly basis and passed to the Artificial Intelligence Sepsis 
Expert algorithm to predict onset of sepsis in the proceeding T hours (where T = 
12, 8, 6, or 4). Artificial Intelligence Sepsis Expert was used to predict onset 
of sepsis in the proceeding T hours and to produce a list of the most 
significant contributing factors. For the 12-, 8-, 6-, and 4-hour ahead 
prediction of sepsis, Artificial Intelligence Sepsis Expert achieved area under 
the receiver operating characteristic in the range of 0.83-0.85. Performance of 
the Artificial Intelligence Sepsis Expert on the development and validation 
cohorts was indistinguishable.
CONCLUSIONS: Using data available in the ICU in real-time, Artificial 
Intelligence Sepsis Expert can accurately predict the onset of sepsis in an ICU 
patient 4-12 hours prior to clinical recognition. A prospective study is 
necessary to determine the clinical utility of the proposed sepsis prediction 
model.

BACKGROUND: The Triglyceride Glucose-Body Mass Index (TyG-BMI) has been 
established as a robust indicator of insulin resistance (IR), reflecting 
metabolic health across various populations. In general, lower TyG-BMI values 
are often associated with better metabolic health outcomes and a reduced risk of 
adverse health events in non-critically ill populations. Previous studies have 
highlighted a significant negative association between TyG-BMI and all-cause 
mortality (ACM) among critically ill atrial fibrillation patients. Given the 
high prevalence and severe outcomes associated with stroke, understanding how 
TyG-BMI at the time of ICU admission correlates with ACM in critically ill 
stroke patients becomes imperative. This study aims to assess the correlation 
between TyG-BMI and ACM in this specific patient cohort, exploring how 
traditional associations between TyG-BMI and metabolic health may differ in the 
context of acute, life-threatening illness.
METHODS: Patient data were retrieved by accessing the Medical Information Mart 
for Intensive Care IV (MIMIC-IV 2.2) database, categorizing patients into three 
groups on the basis of TyG-BMI tertiles. The study evaluated both primary and 
secondary outcomes: the primary outcomes included the 90-day, 180-day, and 
1-year ACM, while secondary outcomes encompassed ICU, in-hospital, and 30-day 
ACM. Our study employed the Kaplan-Meier (K-M) curve method for outcome 
comparison across the groups while utilizing multivariate Cox 
proportional-hazards regression models and restricted cubic splines (RCS) to 
explore TyG-BMI association with these outcomes. Additionally, interaction and 
subgroup analyses were performed, focusing on different mortality time points.
RESULTS: Among a cohort of 1707 individuals diagnosed with stroke, the average 
age was 68 years (interquartile range [IQR]: 58-78 years), with 946 (55.42%) of 
the participants being male. The analysis of K-M curves suggested that patients 
having a lower TyG-BMI level faced a heightened risk of long-term ACM, whereas 
the short-term ACM exhibited no statistically significant differences across the 
three TyG-BMI groups. Furthermore, Cox proportional-hazards regression analysis 
validated a statistically significant increased risk of long-term ACM among 
patients belonging to the lowest TyG-BMI tertile. Additionally, RCS analysis 
results demonstrated L-shaped correlations between the TyG-BMI index and both 
short- and long-term ACM. These findings underscore the TyG-BMI predictive value 
for long-term mortality in stroke patients, highlighting a nuanced relationship 
that varies over different time frames. The results revealed no interactions 
between TyG-BMI and the stratified variables, with the exception of age.
CONCLUSION: In our study, lower TyG-BMI levels in critically ill stroke patients 
are significantly related to a higher risk of long-term ACM within the context 
of the United States. This finding suggests the potential of TyG-BMI as a marker 
for stratifying long-term risk in this patient population. However, it's crucial 
to note that this association was not observed for short-term ACM, indicating 
that the utility of TyG-BMI may be more pronounced in long-term outcome 
prediction. Additionally, our conclusion that TyG-BMI could serve as a reliable 
indicator for managing and stratifying stroke patients over the long term is 
preliminary. To confirm our findings and assess the universal applicability of 
TyG-BMI as a prognostic tool, it is crucial to conduct rigorously designed 
research across various populations.

BACKGROUND: The stress hyperglycemia ratio (SHR) was developed to mitigate the 
influence of long-term chronic glycemic factors on stress hyperglycemia levels, 
which are associated with adverse clinical events, particularly cardiovascular 
events. However, studies examining the SHR index and its prognostic significance 
in patients with atrial fibrillation (AF) are lacking. This study aims to 
evaluate the relationship between the SHR index and all-cause mortality in 
critically ill patients with AF upon Intensive Care Unit admission.
METHODS: The patients' data were extracted from the Medical Information Mart for 
Intensive Care IV (MIMIC-IV) database. All patients were categorized into four 
groups based on the SHR index. The outcomes include both primary and secondary 
endpoints, with the primary endpoints being 30-day and 365-day all-cause 
mortality, and the secondary endpoints being 90-day and 180-day all-cause 
mortality. The SHR index was analyzed using quartiles, and the Kaplan-Meier 
curve was employed to compare the outcomes across groups. Cox 
proportional-hazards regression and restricted cubic splines (RCS) were used to 
assess the relationship between the SHR index and the outcomes.
RESULTS: Out of a total of 1,685 participants, the average age was 63.12 years 
(range: 40.17 to 101.49), with 1,004 (59.58%) being male. Higher levels of the 
SHR index were associated with an increased risk of all-cause mortality at 30 
days, 90 days, 180 days, and 365 days, as indicated by the Kaplan-Meier curves 
(log-rank P < 0.01). Additionally, Cox proportional-hazards regression analysis 
revealed that the risk of mortality at these time points was significantly 
higher in the highest quartile of the SHR index. Restricted cubic splines (RCS) 
analysis demonstrated U-shaped relationships between the SHR index and all-cause 
mortality, with inflection points at 0.73 for 30-day mortality and 0.76 for 
365-day mortality. Compared to patients with SHR levels below these inflection 
points, those with higher levels had a 69.9% increased risk for 30-day all-cause 
mortality (hazard ratio [HR] 1.699; 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.336 to 2.159) 
and a 61.6% increased risk for 365-day all-cause mortality (HR 1.616; 95% CI 
1.345 to 1.942).
CONCLUSION: In critically ill patients with AF, higher levels of the SHR index 
are significantly associated with an increased risk of all-cause mortality at 30 
days, 90 days, 180 days, and 365 days. The SHR index may serve as a valid 
indicator for assessing the severity and guiding the treatment of AF patients in 
the ICU.

Systemic immune-inflammation index (SII) has been identified as a prognostic 
biomarker for various diseases. Our study aimed to investigate the association 
between SII and mortality risk in critically ill patients with sepsis, thus 
exploring possible tools for rapid screening. This retrospective cohort study 
was conducted using clinical data extracted from the Medical Information Mart 
for Intensive Care Database. The study included only patients diagnosed with 
sepsis admitted to the intensive care unit for the first time. We used the 
restricted cubic splines to explore the relationship between SII and 28-day 
mortality. Kaplan-Meier curve and Cox regression models were performed to 
evaluate the association between SII and mortality. Subgroup analysis was 
performed to explore the stability of the primary results. A total of 16,007 
patients with sepsis were eligible in the final analysis. We found a J-shaped 
relationship between SII and mortality risk. The SII level associated with the 
lowest mortality risk was 774.46*109/L. Compared with the reference group 
(second SII quartile), the 28-day mortality was increased in the highest 
quartile and third quartile groups of SII levels; fully adjusted HRs were 1.16 
(1.02 to 1.32) and 1.40 (1.23 to 1.58), respectively. However, although the 
lower SII (Q1 group) also showed a trend toward a higher hazard of 28-day 
mortality, there was no statistical difference, with a fully adjusted HR of 1.05 
(0.92 to 1.21). In the population of critically ill patients with sepsis, low 
and high SII levels were associated with an increased risk of short-term 
mortality. The 28-day mortality risk was lowest at SII levels of 774.46*109/L.

OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to explore the association between the triglyceride 
glucose index (TyG) and the risk of in-hospital and one-year mortality in 
patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD) and cardiovascular disease (CAD) 
admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU).
METHODS: The data for the study were taken from the Medical Information Mart for 
Intensive Care-IV database which contained over 50,000 ICU admissions from 2008 
to 2019. The Boruta algorithm was used for feature selection. The study used 
univariable and multivariable logistic regression analysis, Cox regression 
analysis, and 3-knotted multivariate restricted cubic spline regression to 
evaluate the association between the TyG index and mortality risk.
RESULTS: After applying inclusion and exclusion criteria, 639 CKD patients with 
CAD were included in the study with a median TyG index of 9.1 [8.6,9.5]. The TyG 
index was nonlinearly associated with in-hospital and one-year mortality risk in 
populations within the specified range.
CONCLUSION: This study shows that TyG is a predictor of one-year mortality and 
in-hospital mortality in ICU patients with CAD and CKD and inform the 
development of new interventions to improve outcomes. In the high-risk group, 
TyG might be a valuable tool for risk categorization and management. Further 
research is required to confirm these results and identify the mechanisms behind 
the link between TyG and mortality in CAD and CKD patients.

BACKGROUND: Non-traumatic subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH), primarily due to the 
rupture of intracranial aneurysms, contributes significantly to the global 
stroke population. A novel biomarker, pan-immune-inflammation value (PIV) or 
called the aggregate index of systemic inflammation (AISI), linked to 
progression-free survival and overall survival in non-small-cell lung cancer and 
mortality in Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) patients, has surfaced 
recently. Its role in non-traumatic SAH patients, however, remains 
under-researched. This study aims to determine the relationship between PIV and 
all-cause mortality in non-traumatic SAH patients.
METHODS: A retrospective analysis was conducted using data from the Medical 
Information Mart for Intensive Care (MIMIC-IV) database to examine the 
association between PIV and all-cause mortality in critically ill patients with 
non-traumatic SAH. PIV measurements were collected at Intensive Care Unit (ICU) 
admission, and several mortality measures were examined. To control for 
potential confounding effects, a 1:1 propensity score matching (PSM) method was 
applied. The optimal PIV cutoff value was identified as 1362.45 using X-tile 
software that is often used to calculate the optimal cut-off values in survival 
analysis and continuous data of medical or epidemiological research. The 
relationship between PIV and short- and long-term all-cause mortality was 
analyzed using a multivariate Cox proportional hazard regression model and 
Kaplan-Meier (K-M) survival curve analysis. Interaction and subgroup analyses 
were also carried out.
RESULTS: The study included 774 non-traumatic SAH patients. After PSM, 241 pairs 
of score-matched patients were generated. The Cox proportional hazard model, 
adjusted for potential confounders, found a high PIV (≥ 1362.45) independently 
associated with 90-day all-cause mortality both pre- (hazard ratio [HR]: 1.67; 
95% confidence intervals (CI): 1.05-2.65; P = 0.030) and post-PSM (HR: 1.58; 95% 
CI: 1.14-2.67; P = 0.042). K-M survival curves revealed lower 90-day survival 
rates in patients with PIV ≥ 1362.45 before (31.1% vs. 16.1%%, P < 0.001) and 
after PSM (68.9% vs. 80.9%, P < 0.001). Similarly, elevated PIV were associated 
with increased risk of ICU (pre-PSM: HR: 2.10; 95% CI: 1.12-3.95; P = 0.02; 
post-PSM: HR: 2.33; 95% CI: 1.11-4.91; P = 0.016), in-hospital (pre-PSM: HR: 
1.91; 95% CI: 1.12-3.26; P = 0.018; post-PSM: 2.06; 95% CI: 1.10-3.84; P = 
0.034), 30-day (pre-PSM: HR: 1.69; 95% CI: 1.01-2.82; P = 0.045; post-PSM: 1.66; 
95% CI: 1.11-2.97; P = 0.047), and 1-year (pre-PSM: HR: 1.58; 95% CI: 1.04-2.40; 
P = 0.032; post-PSM: 1.56; 95% CI: 1.10-2.53; P = 0.044) all-cause mortality. 
The K-M survival curves confirmed lower survival rates in patients with higher 
PIV both pre- and post PSM for ICU (pre-PSM: 18.3% vs. 8.4%, P < 0.001; 
post-PSM:81.7 vs. 91.3%, P < 0.001), in-hospital (pre-PSM: 25.3% vs. 12.8%, P < 
0.001; post-PSM: 75.1 vs. 88.0%, P < 0.001), 30-day (pre-PSM: 24.9% vs. 11.4%, P 
< 0.001; post-PSM:74.7 vs. 86.3%, P < 0.001), and 1-year (pre-PSM: 36.9% vs. 
20.8%, P < 0.001; P = 0.02; post-PSM: 63.1 vs. 75.1%, P < 0.001) all-cause 
mortality. Stratified analyses indicated that the relationship between PIV and 
all-cause mortality varied across different subgroups.
CONCLUSION: In critically ill patients suffering from non-traumatic SAH, an 
elevated PIV upon admission correlated with a rise in all-cause mortality at 
various stages, including ICU, in-hospital, the 30-day, 90-day, and 1-year 
mortality, solidifying its position as an independent mortality risk 
determinant. This study represents an attempt to bridge the current knowledge 
gap and to provide a more nuanced understanding of the role of 
inflammation-based biomarkers in non-traumatic SAH. Nevertheless, to endorse the 
predictive value of PIV for prognosticating outcomes in non-traumatic SAH 
patients, additional prospective case-control studies are deemed necessary.

BACKGROUND: The triglyceride-glucose (TyG) index is a reliable alternative 
biomarker of insulin resistance (IR). However, whether the TyG index has 
prognostic value in critically ill patients with coronary heart disease (CHD) 
remains unclear.
METHODS: Participants from the Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care III 
(MIMIC-III) were grouped into quartiles according to the TyG index. The primary 
outcome was in-hospital all-cause mortality. Cox proportional hazards models 
were constructed to examine the association between TyG index and all-cause 
mortality in critically ill patients with CHD. A restricted cubic splines model 
was used to examine the associations between the TyG index and outcomes.
RESULTS: A total of 1,618 patients (65.14% men) were included. The hospital 
mortality and intensive care unit (ICU) mortality rate were 9.64% and 7.60%, 
respectively. Multivariable Cox proportional hazards analyses indicated that the 
TyG index was independently associated with an elevated risk of hospital 
mortality (HR, 1.71 [95% CI 1.25-2.33] P = 0.001) and ICU mortality (HR, 1.50 
[95% CI 1.07-2.10] P = 0.019). The restricted cubic splines regression model 
revealed that the risk of hospital mortality and ICU mortality increased 
linearly with increasing TyG index (P for non-linearity = 0.467 and P for 
non-linearity = 0.764).
CONCLUSIONS: The TyG index was a strong independent predictor of greater 
mortality in critically ill patients with CHD. Larger prospective studies are 
required to confirm these findings.

BACKGROUND: Comorbidity, frailty, and decreased cognitive function lead to a 
higher risk of death in elderly patients (more than 65 years of age) during 
acute medical events. Early and accurate illness severity assessment can support 
appropriate decision making for clinicians caring for these patients. We aimed 
to develop ELDER-ICU, a machine learning model to assess the illness severity of 
older adults admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) with cohort-specific 
calibration and evaluation for potential model bias.
METHODS: In this retrospective, international multicentre study, the ELDER-ICU 
model was developed using data from 14 US hospitals, and validated in 171 
hospitals from the USA and Netherlands. Data were extracted from the Medical 
Information Mart for Intensive Care database, electronic ICU Collaborative 
Research Database, and Amsterdam University Medical Centers Database. We used 
six categories of data as predictors, including demographics and comorbidities, 
physical frailty, laboratory tests, vital signs, treatments, and urine output. 
Patient data from the first day of ICU stay were used to predict in-hospital 
mortality. We used the eXtreme Gradient Boosting algorithm (XGBoost) to develop 
models and the SHapley Additive exPlanations method to explain model prediction. 
The trained model was calibrated before internal, external, and temporal 
validation. The final XGBoost model was compared against three other machine 
learning algorithms and five clinical scores. We performed subgroup analysis 
based on age, sex, and race. We assessed the discrimination and calibration of 
models using the area under receiver operating characteristic (AUROC) and 
standardised mortality ratio (SMR) with 95% CIs.
FINDINGS: Using the development dataset (n=50 366) and predictive model building 
process, the XGBoost algorithm performed the best in all types of validations 
compared with other machine learning algorithms and clinical scores (internal 
validation with 5037 patients from 14 US hospitals, AUROC=0·866 [95% CI 
0·851-0·880]; external validation in the US population with 20 541 patients from 
169 hospitals, AUROC=0·838 [0·829-0·847]; external validation in European 
population with 2411 patients from one hospital, AUROC=0·833 [0·812-0·853]; 
temporal validation with 4311 patients from one hospital, AUROC=0·884 
[0·869-0·897]). In the external validation set (US population), the median 
AUROCs of bias evaluations covering eight subgroups were above 0·81, and the 
overall SMR was 0·99 (0·96-1·03). The top ten risk predictors were the minimum 
Glasgow Coma Scale score, total urine output, average respiratory rate, 
mechanical ventilation use, best state of activity, Charlson Comorbidity Index 
score, geriatric nutritional risk index, code status, age, and maximum blood 
urea nitrogen. A simplified model containing only the top 20 features 
(ELDER-ICU-20) had similar predictive performance to the full model.
INTERPRETATION: The ELDER-ICU model reliably predicts the risk of in-hospital 
mortality using routinely collected clinical features. The predictions could 
inform clinicians about patients who are at elevated risk of deterioration. 
Prospective validation of this model in clinical practice and a process for 
continuous performance monitoring and model recalibration are needed.

BACKGROUND: Sepsis is a common critical condition caused by the body's 
overwhelming response to certain infective agents. Many biomarkers, including 
the serum lactate level, have been used for sepsis diagnosis and guiding 
treatment. Recently, the Third International Consensus Definitions for Sepsis 
and Septic Shock (Sepsis-3) recommended the Sequential Organ Failure Assessment 
(SOFA) and the quick SOFA (qSOFA) rather than lactate for screening sepsis and 
assess prognosis. Here, we aim to explore and compare the prognostic accuracy of 
the lactate level, the SOFA score and the qSOFA score for mortality in septic 
patients using the public Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care III 
database (MIMIC III).
METHODS: The baseline characteristics, laboratory test results and outcomes for 
sepsis patients were retrieved from MIMIC III. Survival was analysed by the 
Kaplan-Meier method. Univariate and multivariate analysis was performed to 
identify predictors of prognosis. Receiver operating characteristic curve (ROC) 
analysis was conducted to compare lactate with SOFA and qSOFA scores.
RESULTS: A total of 3713 cases were initially identified. The analysis cohort 
included 1865 patients. The 24-h average lactate levels and the worst scores 
during the first 24 h of ICU admission were collected. Patients in the higher 
lactate group had higher mortality than those in the lower lactate group. 
Lactate was an independent predictor of sepsis prognosis. The AUROC of lactate 
(AUROC, 0.664 [95% CI, 0.639-0.689]) was significantly higher than that of qSOFA 
(AUROC, 0.547 [95% CI, 0.521-0.574]), and it was similar to the AUROC of SOFA 
(AUROC, 0.686 [95% CI, 0.661-0.710]). But the timing of lactate relative to SOFA 
and qSOFA scores was inconsistent.
CONCLUSION: Lactate is an independent prognostic predictor of mortality for 
patients with sepsis. It has superior discriminative power to qSOFA, and shows 
discriminative ability similar to that of SOFA.

BACKGROUND: Biomarker of insulin resistance, namely triglyceride-glucose index, 
is potentially useful in identifying critically ill patients at high risk of 
hospital death. However, the TyG index might have variations over time during 
ICU stay. Hence, the purpose of the current research was to verify the 
associations between the dynamic change of the TyG index during the hospital 
stay and all-cause mortality.
METHODS: The present retrospective cohort study was conducted using the Medical 
Information Mart for Intensive Care IV 2.0 (MIMIC-IV) critical care dataset, 
which included data from 8835 patients with 13,674 TyG measurements. The primary 
endpoint was 1-year all-cause mortality. Secondary outcomes included in-hospital 
all-cause mortality, the need for mechanical ventilation during hospitalization, 
length of stay in the hospital. Cumulative curves were calculated using the 
Kaplan-Meier method. Propensity score matching was performed to reduce any 
potential baseline bias. Restricted cubic spline analysis was also employed to 
assess any potential non-linear associations. Cox proportional hazards analyses 
were performed to examine the association between the dynamic change of TyG 
index and mortality.
RESULTS: The follow-up period identified a total of 3010 all-cause deaths 
(35.87%), of which 2477 (29.52%) occurred within the first year. The cumulative 
incidence of all-cause death increased with a higher quartile of the TyGVR, 
while there were no differences in the TyG index. Restricted cubic spline 
analysis revealed a nearly linear association between TyGVR and the risk of 
in-hospital all-cause mortality (P for non-linear = 0.449, P for 
overall = 0.004) as well as 1-year all-cause mortality (P for 
non-linear = 0.909, P for overall = 0.019). The area under the curve of 
all-cause mortality by various conventional severity of illness scores 
significantly improved with the addition of the TyG index and TyGVR. The results 
were basically consistent in subgroup analysis.
CONCLUSIONS: Dynamic change of TyG during hospital stay is associated with 
in-hospital and 1-year all-cause mortality, and may be superior to the effect of 
baseline TyG index.

BACKGROUND: Triglyceride-glucose (TyG) index, a dependable indicator of insulin 
resistance, has been identified as a valid marker regarding multiple 
cardiovascular diseases. Nevertheless, the correlation of TyG index with acute 
myocardial infarction complicated by cardiogenic shock (AMICS) remains 
uncertain. Our study aims for elucidating this relationship by comprehensively 
analyzing two large-scale cohorts.
METHODS: Utilizing records from the eICU Collaborative Research Database and the 
Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care IV, the link between TyG and the 
incidence and prognosis of AMICS was assessed multicentrally and retrospectively 
by logistic and correlation models, as well as restricted cubic spline (RCS). 
Propensity score matching (PSM), inverse probability of treatment weighting 
(IPTW), and overlap weighting (OW) were employed to balance the potential 
confounders. Subgroup analyses were performed according to potential modifiers.
RESULTS: Overall, 5208 AMI patients, consisting of 375 developing CS were 
finally included. The TyG index exhibited an apparently higher level in AMI 
populations developing CS than in those who did not experienced CS [9.2 
(8.8-9.7) vs. 9.0 (8.5-9.5)], with a moderate discrimination ability to 
recognize AMICS from the general AMI (AUC: 0.604). Logistic analyses showed that 
the TyG index was significantly correlated with in-hospital and ICU mortality. 
RCS analysis demonstrated a linear link between elevated TyG and increased risks 
regarding in-hospital and ICU mortality in the AMICS population. An increased 
mortality risk remains evident in PSM-, OW- and IPTW-adjusted populations with 
higher TyG index who have undergone CS. Correlation analyses demonstrated an 
apparent link between TyG index and APS score. Subgroup analyses presented a 
stable link between elevated TyG and mortality particularly in older age, 
females, those who are overweight or hypertensive, as well as those without 
diabetes.
CONCLUSIONS: Elevated TyG index was related to the incidence of CS following AMI 
and higher mortality risks in the population with AMICS. Our findings pointed a 
previously undisclosed role of TyG index in regard to AMICS that still requires 
further validation.

BACKGROUND: The atherogenic index of plasma (AIP) is considered an important 
marker of atherosclerosis and cardiovascular risk. However, its potential role 
in predicting length of stay (LOS), especially in patients with atherosclerotic 
cardiovascular disease (ASCVD), remains to be explored. We investigated the 
effect of AIP on hospital LOS in critically ill ASCVD patients and explored the 
risk factors affecting LOS in conjunction with machine learning.
METHODS: Using data from the Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care 
(MIMIC)-IV. AIP was calculated as the logarithmic ratio of TG to HDL-C, and 
patients were stratified into four groups based on AIP values. We investigated 
the association between AIP and two key clinical outcomes: ICU LOS and total 
hospital LOS. Multivariate logistic regression models were used to evaluate 
these associations, while restricted cubic spline (RCS) regressions assessed 
potential nonlinear relationships. Additionally, machine learning (ML) 
techniques, including logistic regression (LR), decision tree (DT), random 
forest (RF), extreme gradient boosting (XGB), and light gradient boosting 
machine (LGB), were applied, with the Shapley additive explanation (SHAP) method 
used to determine feature importance.
RESULTS: The study enrolled a total of 2423 patients with critically ill ASCVD, 
predominantly male (54.91%), and revealed that higher AIP values were 
independently associated with longer ICU and hospital stays. Specifically, for 
each unit increase in AIP, the odds of prolonged ICU and hospital stays were 
significantly higher, with adjusted odds ratios (OR) of 1.42 (95% CI, 1.11-1.81; 
P = 0.006) and 1.73 (95% CI, 1.34-2.24; P < 0.001), respectively. The RCS 
regression demonstrated a linear relationship between increasing AIP and both 
ICU LOS and hospital LOS. ML models, specifically LGB (ROC:0.740) and LR 
(ROC:0.832) demonstrated superior predictive accuracy for these endpoints, 
identifying AIP as a vital component of hospitalization duration.
CONCLUSION: AIP is a significant predictor of ICU and hospital LOS in patients 
with critically ill ASCVD. AIP could serve as an early prognostic tool for 
guiding clinical decision-making and managing patient outcomes.

BACKGROUND: The relationship between psoriasis and aging remains unclear. 
Biological age is considered as a tool for strong association with aging, but 
there is a lack of reports on the relationship between biological age and 
psoriasis. Therefore, this study aimed to explore the relationship between 
biological age and psoriasis.
METHODS: Patients with psoriasis and non-psoriasis were recruited from National 
Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) (12,973 cases), Medical 
Information Mart for Intensive Care (MIMIC-IV) (558 cases) and The First 
Clinical Medical College of Zhejiang Chinese Medical University (206 cases). 
Biological age was calculated using Klemera-Doubal method age (KDM-age) and 
phenotypic age (PhenoAge). Linear regression and logistic regression were used 
to explore the association between psoriasis and biological age advance. Cox 
regression was used to investigate the association between biological age 
advance and mortality. Finally, biological age advance was used to predict the 
death of psoriasis patients.
RESULTS: In NHANES, linear regression showed that psoriasis led to a 0.54 
advance in PhenoAge (Adjust Beta: 0.54, 95CI: 0.12-0.97, p = 0.018). The KDM-age 
advance due to psoriasis was not statistically significant (p = 0.754). Using 
data from China, we came to the new conclusion that for every unit rise in 
Psoriasis Area and Severity Index, PhenoAge advance rose by 0.12 (Beta: 0.12, 
95CI: 0.01-0.22, p = 0.031). Using NHANES data, cox regression shows for every 
unit rise in PhenoAge advance patients had an 8% rise in mortality (Adjust 
hazard ratio: 1.08, 95CI: 1.04-1.12, p < 0.001). Using MIMIC-IV, logistic 
regression showed a 13% increase in mortality within 28 days of admission for 
every 1 unit rise in PhenoAge advance (odds ratio: 1.13, 95CI: 1.09-1.18, 
P < 0.001). Finally, we used PhenoAge advance to predict death, with an AUC of 
0.71 in the NHANES, an ACU of 0.79 for predicting death within 1 years in the 
general ward of MIMIC-IV. In the ICU of MIMIC-IV, the AUC for predicting death 
within 28 days was 0.71.
CONCLUSION: Psoriasis leads to accelerated biological aging in patients, which 
is associated with the severity of psoriasis and more comorbidities. In 
addition, PhenoAge has the potential to monitor the health status of patients 
with psoriasis.

BACKGROUND: The triglyceride-glucose (TyG) index has demonstrated correlations 
with adverse clinical outcomes in patients with ischaemic stroke, coronary heart 
disease and cardiac failure. However, its association with overall mortality in 
individuals concurrently experiencing heart failure (HF) and chronic kidney 
disease (CKD) remains inadequately explored.
METHODS: Utilizing the Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care IV (Version 
2.2) repository, subjects underwent quartile stratification based on the TyG 
index. The primary endpoint was all-cause mortality during hospitalization. Cox 
proportional hazard models were employed to examine the correlation between TyG 
and all-cause mortality in HF patients with CKD. Evaluation involved 
Kaplan-Meier (KM) analysis and restricted cubic splines (RCSs) to compare 
mortality rates during hospitalization and 1 year after admission across cohorts 
with varying TyG index levels.
RESULTS: A cohort of 1537 HF and CKD patients participated. Cox regression 
analysis revealed elevated TyG levels as an independent risk factor for both 
in-hospital and 1 year mortality. RCS analysis indicated a rising, non-linear 
association between TyG levels and all-cause mortality (P value for non-linear 
<0.001). KM survival curves demonstrated a statistically significant reduction 
in survival rates within the high TyG index group compared with the low one 
(log-rank P < 0.001).
CONCLUSIONS: The TyG index exhibited substantial independent prognostic value 
for elevated in-hospital and 1 year all-cause mortality among the cohort with HF 
and CKD. These findings suggest that assessing the TyG index could play a 
crucial role in developing novel therapeutic strategies to improve outcomes for 
this high-risk demographic.

OBJECTIVE: A decrease in platelet count has been reported to be associated with 
several neonatal inflammatory diseases, including sepsis and necrotizing 
enterocolitis; while its association with neonatal acute kidney injury (AKI) has 
not been reported. This study aims to explore the association between platelet 
count and neonatal AKI.
METHODS: This was a retrospective cohort study based on the Medical Information 
Mart for Intensive Care III (MIMIC-III) database. Data were extracted based on 
baseline characteristics, comorbidities, vital signs, laboratory parameters, and 
intervention measures. Logistic regression analysis was used to assess the 
association between platelet count and AKI, and results were shown as odds 
ratios (OR) with 95% confidence intervals (CI).
RESULTS: A total of 1,576 neonates were finally included in the analysis. After 
adjusting birth weight, sepsis, patent ductus arteriosus, hematocrit, percentage 
of neutrophils, and vasopressor use, we found that platelet count in the lowest 
quartile (Q1) was significantly associated with the higher odds of AKI than 
platelet count in the highest quartile (Q4) (OR = 1.70, 95% CI: 1.01-2.87).
CONCLUSIONS: Low platelet count was associated with the high odds of AKI in the 
neonatal intensive care unit (NICU), indicating that platelet count might be a 
biomarker for neonatal AKI. Large-scale multicenter studies should be performed 
to verify the results.

BACKGROUND: The triglyceride-glucose (TyG) index, an emerging surrogate marker 
of insulin resistance, has been implicated in adverse cardiovascular outcomes. 
However, its prognostic value in critically ill patients with atrial 
fibrillation (AF) remains unclear. This study aimed to investigate the 
association between the TyG index and all-cause mortality in this high-risk 
population.
METHODS: We identified critically ill patients with AF from the Medical 
Information Mart for Intensive Care IV (MIMIC-IV) database and categorized them 
into tertiles based on their TyG index levels. The primary outcome was 30-day 
mortality, with 90-day and 365-day all-cause mortality as secondary outcomes. 
Cox proportional hazards regression analysis and restricted cubic splines were 
used to elucidate the relationship between the TyG index and all-cause 
mortality. Kaplan-Meier survival analysis was performed to visualize survival 
differences among the tertiles.
RESULTS: A total of 1473 patients were included; the 30-day, 90-day, and 365-day 
all-cause mortality rates were 26.8%, 33.3%, and 41.1%, respectively. 
Multivariate Cox proportional hazards analysis revealed that the TyG index was 
independently associated with mortality at 30 days [hazard ratio (HR) (95% 
confidence interval (CI)) 1.26 (1.09-1.45), P = 0.002], 90 days [HR (95% CI) 
1.27 (1.11-1.45), P < 0.001], and 365 days [HR (95% CI) 1.24 (1.10-1.40), 
P < 0.001]. Restricted cubic splines regression showed a positive linear 
association between the TyG index and mortality risk. Kaplan-Meier survival 
curves further confirmed the significant survival disparities across TyG index 
tertiles.
CONCLUSIONS: A significant linear association was observed between higher TyG 
index and increased all-cause mortality at 30, 90, and 365 days in critically 
ill patients with AF. This underscores the role of the TyG index as a key 
prognostic indicator for risk stratification and management in intensive care.

The prognosis of septic patients with cirrhosis is worse compared to septic 
patients without cirrhosis. Early and accurate prognosis determination in 
patients with cirrhosis and sepsis is pivotal for guiding treatment decisions. 
The aim of this study was to investigate the association between 
albumin-corrected anion gap (ACAG) and clinical prognosis of patients with 
sepsis and cirrhosis. This study extracted data of patients with sepsis and 
cirrhosis from the Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care (MIMIC-IV) 
database. A total of 1340 patients (64.6% male) were enrolled. After confounders 
adjusting, elevated ACAG had a significant association with 28-day mortality 
(HR1.604; 95% CI 1.258-2.048; P < 0.001). Restricted cubic spline revealed that 
a linear relationship between ACAG and 28-day mortality (P-nonlinear = 0.089, 
P-overall = 0.001). According to the ROC curve analysis, the ACAG demonstrated a 
higher area under the curve (AUC) of 0.703 compared to AG (0.675). Kaplan-Meier 
analysis revealed higher 28-day mortality in high ACAG group (log-rank test, 
χ^2 = 175.638, P < 0.001). Furthermore, subgroup analysis showed a significant 
interaction between ACAG and etiology of cirrhosis (P for interaction = 0.014). 
Therefore, ACAG could provide clinicians with valuable insights for guiding 
interventions in this high-risk population.

BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: Stress hyperglycemia is common in critically ill 
patients and is associated with poor prognosis. Whether this association exists 
in pulmonary hypertension (PH) patients is unknown. The present cohort study 
investigated the association of stress hyperglycemia with 90-day all-cause 
mortality in intensive care unit (ICU) patients with PH.
METHODS: Data of the study population were extracted from the Medical 
Information Mart for Intensive Care IV (MIMIC-IV) database. A new index, the 
ratio of admission glucose to HbA1c (GAR), was used to evaluate stress 
hyperglycemia. The study population was divided into groups according to GAR 
quartiles (Q1-Q4). The outcome of interest was all-cause mortality within 90 
days, which was considered a short-term prognosis.
RESULT: A total of 53,569 patients were screened. Ultimately, 414 PH patients 
were enrolled; 44.2% were male, and 23.2% were admitted to the cardiac ICU. As 
the GAR increased from Q2 to Q4, the groups had lower creatinine levels, longer 
ICU stays, and a higher proportion of renal disease. After adjusting for 
confounding factors such as demographics, vital signs, and comorbidities, an 
elevated GAR was associated with an increased risk of 90-day mortality.
CONCLUSION: Stress hyperglycemia assessed by the GAR was associated with 
increased 90-day mortality in ICU patients with PH.

Pan-Immune-Inflammation Value (PIV) has recently received more attention as a 
novel indicator of inflammation. We aimed to evaluate the association between 
PIV and prognosis in septic patients. Data were extracted from the Medical 
Information Mart for Intensive Care IV database. The primary and secondary 
outcomes were 28-day and 90-day mortality. The association between PIV and 
outcomes was assessed by Kaplan-Meier curves, Cox regression analysis, 
restricted cubic spline curves and subgroup analysis. A total of 11,331 septic 
patients were included. Kaplan-Meier curves showed that septic patients with 
higher PIV had lower 28-day survival rate. In multivariable Cox regression 
analysis, log2-PIV was positively associated with the risk of 28-day mortality 
[HR (95% CI) 1.06 (1.03, 1.09), P < 0.001]. The relationship between log2-PIV 
and 28-day mortality was non-linear with a predicted inflection point at 8. To 
the right of the inflection point, high log2-PIV was associated with an 
increased 28-day mortality risk [HR (95% CI) 1.13 (1.09, 1.18), P < 0.001]. 
However, to the left of this point, this association was non-significant [HR 
(95% CI) 1.01 (0.94, 1.08), P = 0.791]. Similar results were found for 90-day 
mortality. Our study showed a non-linear relationship between PIV and 28-day and 
90-day mortality risk in septic patients.

BACKGROUND: The association between the stress hyperglycemia ratio (SHR), which 
represents the degree of acute stress hyperglycemic status, and the risk of 
mortality in cerebrovascular disease patients in the intensive care unit (ICU) 
remains unclear. This study aims to investigate the predictive ability of SHR 
for in-hospital mortality in critically ill cerebrovascular disease patients and 
to assess its potential to enhance existing predictive models.
METHODS: We extracted data from the Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care 
(MIMIC-IV) database for patients diagnosed with cerebrovascular disease and used 
Cox regression to assess the association between SHR and mortality. To 
investigate the nature of this association, we applied restricted cubic spline 
analysis to determine if it is linear. The predictive ability of SHR for 
mortality risk was evaluated using receiver operating characteristic (ROC) 
curves and the C-index.
RESULTS: We included a total of 2,461 patients, with a mean age of 70.55 ± 14.59 
years, and 1,221 (49.61%) being female. Cox regression analysis revealed that 
SHR was independently associated with both in-hospital mortality (per standard 
deviation (SD) increase: hazard ratio (HR) 1.35, 95% confidence interval (CI) 
1.23-1.48) and ICU mortality (per SD increase: HR 1.37, 95% CI 1.21-1.54). The 
risk of death increased in an approximately linear fashion when SHR exceeded 
0.77-0.79. Subgroup analysis indicated the association was more pronounced in 
non-diabetic individuals. Additionally, incorporating SHR into existing models 
improved both discrimination and reclassification performance.
CONCLUSION: SHR serves as an independent risk factor for in-hospital mortality 
in cerebrovascular disease patients in the ICU. Adding SHR to existing models 
enhances their predictive performance, offering clinical value in the 
identification of high-risk patients.

OBJECTIVE: The present study aimed to evaluate the relationship between 
all-cause mortality and the neutrophil percentage-to-albumin ratio (NPAR) in 
patients with atrial fibrillation (AF).
METHODS: We obtained clinical information from patients with AF from the Medical 
Information Mart for Intensive Care-IV version 2.0 (MIMIC-IV) database and the 
Second Affiliated Hospital and Yuying Children's Hospital of Wenzhou Medical 
University (WMU). The clinical endpoints were all-cause death measured at 
30-day, 90-day, and one-year intervals. For endpoints associated with the NPAR, 
logistic regression models were used to calculate odds ratios (OR) with 95% 
confidence intervals (CI). Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves and 
area under the curve (AUC) were developed to compare the ability of different 
inflammatory biomarkers to predict 90-day mortality in patients with AF.
RESULTS: Higher NPAR was associated with a higher risk of 30-day (OR 2.08, 95% 
CI 1.58-2.75), 90-day (OR 2.07, 95% CI 1.61-2.67), and one-year mortality (OR 
1.60, 95% CI 1.26-2.04) in patients with AF in 2813 patients from MIMIC-IV. The 
predictive performance of NPAR (AUC = 0.609) for 90-day mortality was better 
than that of neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio (NLR) (AUC = 0.565, P < 0.001), and 
platelet-to-lymphocyte ratio (PLR) (AUC = 0.528, P < 0.001). When NPAR and 
sequential organ failure assessment (SOFA) were combined, the AUC increased from 
0.609 to 0.674 (P < 0.001). Higher NPAR was associated with a higher risk of 
30-day mortality (OR 2.54, 95% CI 1.02-6.30) and 90-day mortality (OR 2.76, 95% 
CI 1.09-7.01) in 283 patients from WMU.
CONCLUSION: An increased 30-day, 90-day, and one-year mortality risk among 
patients with AF were linked to a higher NPAR in MIMIC-IV. NPAR was thought to 
be a good predictor of 90-day all-cause mortality. Higher NPAR was associated 
with a higher risk of 30-day and 90-day mortality in WMU.

BACKGROUND: In recent years, the hemoglobin, albumin, lymphocyte, and platelet 
(HALP) score has emerged as a potential marker of immunological and nutritional 
status. This study aimed to evaluate the association between the HALP score and 
prognosis in patients with sepsis.
METHODS: This retrospective cohort study analyzed sepsis patients using clinical 
data from the Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care IV (MIMIC-IV) 
database. Patients were classified into Low-score and High-score groups. 
Confounding factors were controlled through propensity score matching (PSM) 
analysis. The primary outcome was 28-day mortality in individuals with sepsis. 
Survival probabilities between groups were compared using Kaplan-Meier curves. 
Multivariable Cox regression analysis and a smoothing spline fitting curve were 
employed to investigate the relationship between the HALP score and 28-day 
mortality. ROC curve analysis and subgroup analysis were performed to evaluate 
the predictive ability of the HALP score and its components.
RESULTS: A total of 2,968 sepsis patients were included, with 809 (27.26%) 
deaths within 28 days. After PSM analysis, the High-score group had a 24% lower 
risk of 28-day mortality compared to the Low-score group (HR, 0.76; 95% CI, 
0.64-0.91). In the unmatched cohort, the multivariable Cox regression model also 
indicated that the High-score group had a lower 28-day mortality risk (HR, 0.78; 
95% CI, 0.67-0.91). The smoothing spline fitting curve showed a nonlinear 
relationship between the HALP score and 28-day mortality, with an inflection 
point at 24.69. When the HALP score was below 24.69, an increase of one point in 
the HALP score was associated with a 2% reduction in 28-day mortality (HR, 0.98; 
95% CI, 0.97-0.99). The HALP score provided incremental predictive value for 
28-day mortality when combined with the SOFA score. Albumin was identified as 
the most influential component of the HALP score.
CONCLUSION: Among patients with sepsis, the HALP score exhibited a nonlinear 
relationship with 28-day mortality. An elevated HALP score is associated with 
reduced 28-day, 90-day, 360-day, and in-hospital mortality among sepsis 
patients.

AIMS: This study aims to develop explainable machine learning models and 
clinical tools for predicting mortality in patients in the intensive care unit 
(ICU) with heart failure (HF).
METHODS: Patients diagnosed with HF who experienced their first ICU stay lasting 
between 24 h and 28 days were selected from the Medical Information Mart for 
Intensive Care IV (MIMIC-IV) database. The primary outcome was all-cause 
mortality within 28 days. Data analysis was performed using Python and R, with 
feature selection conducted via least absolute shrinkage and selection operator 
(LASSO) regression. Fifteen models were evaluated, and the most effective model 
was rendered explainable through the Shapley additive explanations (SHAP) 
approach. A nomogram was developed based on logistic regression to facilitate 
interpretation. For external validation, the eICU database was utilized.
RESULTS: After selection, the study included 2343 records, with 1808 surviving 
and 535 deceased patients. The median age of the study population was 70.00, 
with ~3/5 males (60.31%). The median length of stay in the ICU was 6.00 days. 
The median age of the survival group was younger than the non-survival group 
(69.00 vs. 73.00), and non-survival patients spent longer time in the ICU. 
Seventy-five features were initially selected, including basic information, 
vital signs, laboratory tests, haemodynamics and oxygen status. LASSO regression 
determined the shrinkage parameter α = 0.020, and 44 features were chosen for 
model construction. The linear discriminant analysis (LDA) model showed the best 
performance, and the accuracy reached 0.8354 in the training cohort and 0.8563 
in the testing cohort. It showed satisfying area under the curve (AUC), recall, 
precision, F1 score, Cohen's kappa score and Matthew's correlation coefficient. 
The concordance index (c-index) reached 0.7972 in the training cohort and 0.8125 
in the testing cohort. In external validation, the LDA model achieved 
approximately 0.9 in accuracy, precision, recall and F1 score, with an AUC of 
0.79. Univariable analysis was performed in the training cohort. Features that 
differed significantly between the survival and non-survival groups were 
subjected to multiple logistic regression. The nomogram built on multiple 
logistic regression included 14 features and demonstrated excellent performance. 
The AUC of the nomogram is 0.852 in the training cohort, 0.855 in the internal 
validation cohort and 0.770 in the external validation cohort. The calibration 
curve showed good consistency.
CONCLUSIONS: The study developed an LDA and a nomogram model for predicting 
mortality in HF patients in the ICU. The SHAP approach was employed to elucidate 
the LDA model, enhancing its utility for clinicians. These models were made 
accessible online for clinical application.

Triglyceride-glucose (TyG) index has emerged as a novel biomarker for detecting 
insulin resistance (IR) and has been proven to be associated with various 
diseases. However, its correlation with the prognosis of severe sepsis remains 
unraveled. This retrospective cohort study utilized patient records from the 
Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care (MIMIC-IV, version 2.2) to examine 
the outcomes of patients with sepsis. The primary outcomes were hospital 
mortality and intensive care unit (ICU) mortality. The correlation between the 
TyG index and outcomes was evaluated through the Kaplan-Meier method, the 
Log-rank test, and univariate and multivariate Cox regression analyses. 
Additionally, restricted cubic spline (RCS) regression analysis was employed to 
delve into the nonlinear relationship between baseline TyG index and outcomes, 
with trend significance assessed through quartile levels. Subgroup analyses were 
conducted to evaluate the consistency of the TyG index's prognostic value across 
various influencing factors. The study included 1,742 patients with sepsis 
requiring intensive care. The in-hospital mortality rate was 19.75% (344/1,742), 
and the ICU mortality rate was 14.75% (257/1,742). Cox regression analysis 
revealed that, in comparison to the first quartile (Q1), patients in the fourth 
quartile (Q4) had a 63% higher risk of in-hospital mortality (HR 1.63 [95% CI 
1.22 to 2.18], P < 0.01) and a 79% higher risk of ICU mortality (HR 1.79 [95% CI 
1.28 to 2.51], P < 0.001). Model 3 showed that ICU mortality risks for Q4, Q3, 
and Q2 were 240%, 75%, and 33% higher, respectively (HR 3.40 [95% CI 2.24 to 
5.16], P < 0.001; HR 1.75 [95% CI 1.16 to 2.63], P = 0.007; HR 1.33 [95% CI 1.20 
to 1.53], P < 0.001). RCS regression analysis identified a nonlinear association 
between the TyG index and mortality (overall P < 0.001; P for 
nonlinearity < 0.001, with an inflection point at 8.9). Subgroup analysis showed 
that the effect size and direction were consistent across different subgroups, 
suggesting the stability of the results. This study demonstrates that a higher 
TyG index is significantly associated with increased in-hospital and ICU 
mortality risk in critically ill sepsis patients, with evidence of non-linear 
correlation. Therefore, the TyG index helps identify the mortality prognosis of 
sepsis patients in the ICU.

Immunosuppression and malnutrition play pivotal roles in the complications of 
intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH) and are intricately linked to the development of 
stroke-associated pneumonia (SAP). Inflammatory markers, including NLR 
(neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio), SII (systemic immune inflammation index), SIRI 
(systemic inflammatory response index), and SIS (systemic inflammation score), 
along with nutritional indexes such as CONUT (controlling nutritional status) 
and PNI (prognostic nutritional index), are crucial indicators influencing the 
inflammatory state following ICH. In this study, our objective was to compare 
the predictive efficacy of inflammatory and nutritional indices for SAP in ICH 
patients, aiming to determine and explore their clinical utility in early 
pneumonia detection. Patients with severe ICH requiring ICU admission were 
screened from the Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care IV (MIMIC-IV) 
database. The outcomes included the occurrence of SAP and in-hospital death. 
Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis, multivariate logistic 
regression, smooth curve analysis, and stratified analysis were employed to 
investigate the relationship between the CONUT index and the clinical outcomes 
of patients with severe ICH. A total of 348 patients were enrolled in the study. 
The incidence of SAP was 21.3%, and the in-hospital mortality rate was 17.0%. 
Among these indicators, multiple regression analysis revealed that CONUT, PNI, 
and SIRI were independently associated with SAP. Further ROC curve analysis 
demonstrated that CONUT (AUC 0.6743, 95% CI 0.6079-0.7408) exhibited the most 
robust predictive ability for SAP in patients with ICH. Threshold analysis 
revealed that when CONUT < 6, an increase of 1 point in CONUT was associated 
with a 1.39 times higher risk of SAP. Similarly, our findings indicate that 
CONUT has the potential to predict the prognosis of patients with ICH. Among the 
inflammatory and nutritional markers, CONUT stands out as the most reliable 
predictor of SAP in patients with ICH. Additionally, it proves to be a valuable 
indicator for assessing the prognosis of patients with ICH.

The utilization of artificial intelligence (AI) in healthcare is on the rise, 
demanding increased accessibility to (public) medical data for benchmarking. The 
digitization of healthcare in recent years has facilitated medical data 
scientists' access to extensive hospital data, fostering AI-based research. A 
notable addition to this trend is the Salzburg Intensive Care database (SICdb), 
made publicly available in early 2023. Covering over 27 thousand intensive care 
admissions at the University Hospital Salzburg from 2013 to 2021, this dataset 
presents a valuable resource for AI-driven investigations. This article explores 
the SICdb and conducts a comparative analysis with the widely recognized Medical 
Information Mart for Intensive Care - version IV (MIMIC-IV) database. The 
comparison focuses on key aspects, emphasizing the availability and granularity 
of data provided by the SICdb, particularly vital signs and laboratory 
measurements. The analysis demonstrates that the SICdb offers more detailed 
information with higher data availability and temporal resolution for signal 
data, especially for vital signs, compared to the MIMIC-IV. This is advantageous 
for longitudinal studies of patients' health conditions in the intensive care 
unit. The SICdb provides a valuable resource for medical data scientists and 
researchers. The database offers comprehensive and diverse healthcare data in a 
European country, making it well suited for benchmarking and enhancing AI-based 
healthcare research. The importance of ongoing efforts to expand and make public 
datasets available for advancing AI applications in the healthcare domain is 
emphasized by the findings.

OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to evaluate the association between the Endothelial 
Activation and Stress Index (EASIX) and 30-day mortality risk in acute 
myocardial infarction (AMI) patients.
METHODS: Using a retrospective cohort design, data were extracted from the 
Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care-IV (MIMIC-IV) database between 2008 
and 2019. Patients diagnosed with AMI at intensive care unit (ICU) admission 
were included. EASIX score was calculated as follows: lactate dehydrogenase 
(LDH) level (U/L) × creatinine level (mg/dL)/platelet count (109/L). Cox 
regression models assessed the association between EASIX and 30-day mortality, 
with subgroup analyses based on age, gender, AMI subtype, and sepsis status.
RESULTS: A total of 1,036 patients were analyzed, among whom 323 did not survive 
beyond 30 days post-ICU admission. Higher EASIX scores were associated with 
increased 30-day mortality in AMI patients [Hazard ratio (HR): 1.70, 95% 
confidence interval (CI): 1.17-2.46, P = 0.005). Subgroup analyses supported 
these findings and revealed significant interactions between EASIX and variables 
such as gender and AMI subtype (P < 0.05).
CONCLUSION: Elevated EASIX scores are significantly correlated with increased 
30-day mortality risk in AMI patients, suggesting EASIX as a valuable prognostic 
tool that may inform clinical management strategies to improve outcomes in AMI.

OBJECTIVE: The goal of the research is to investigate the link between serum 
potassium levels and death after 28 days in sepsis patients, utilizing an 
extensive sample of patients from the multi-center Medical Information Mart for 
Intensive Care IV (MIMIC-IV) database. Current research on serum potassium 
levels and 28-day mortality in sepsis patients is questionable. This study adds 
to the growing body of evidence linking serum potassium levels to the 28-day 
possibility of death in patients with sepsis.
METHODS: We collected 349,08 patients with sepsis from the retrospective cohort 
MIMIC-IV database, using serum potassium level on the first day of admission to 
the intensive care unit as the exposure variable and mortality at 28 days as the 
outcome variable. And controlled for confounding characteristics including 
gender, age, ethnicity, and vital signs during admission.
RESULTS: Serum potassium has a U-shaped connection with 28-day mortality in 
patients suffering from sepsis. The turning point was 4.10 mmol/L (95 % 
confidence interval: 4.03 to 4.22). Serum potassium and 28-day mortality were 
negatively linked on the inflection point's left side (OR: 0.72; 95 % CI: 0.63 
to 0.83, P < 0.0001); on the opposing side of the point of inflexion, serum 
potassium was enthusiastically attached to 28-day mortality. (OR: 1.13; 95 % CI: 
1.06 to 1.21, P < 0.0001).
CONCLUSION: The research conducted found that too high or too low potassium 
levels were linked to a 28-day risk of mortality in humans with sepsis.

BACKGROUND: The stress hyperglycemia ratio (SHR) was developed to reduce the 
effects of long-term chronic glycemic factors on stress hyperglycemia levels, 
which was associated with adverse clinical outcomes. This study aims to evaluate 
the relationship between the postoperative SHR index and all-cause mortality in 
patients undergoing cardiac surgery.
METHODS: Data for this study were extracted from the Medical Information Mart 
for Intensive Care IV (MIMIC-IV) database. Patients were categorized into four 
groups based on postoperative SHR index quartiles. The primary outcome was 
30-day all-cause mortality, while the secondary outcomes included in-hospital, 
90-day and 360-day all-cause mortality. The SHR index was analyzed using 
quartiles, and Kaplan-Meier curves were generated to compare outcomes across 
groups. Cox proportional hazards regression and restricted cubic splines (RCS) 
were employed to assess the relationship between the SHR index and the outcomes. 
LASSO regression was used for feature selection. Six machine learning algorithms 
were used to predict in-hospital all-cause mortality and were further extended 
to predict 360-day all-cause mortality. The SHapley Additive exPlanations method 
was used for visualizing model characteristics and individual case predictions.
RESULTS: A total of 3,848 participants were included in the study, with a mean 
age of 68 ± 12 years and female participants comprised 30.6% (1,179). Higher 
postoperative SHR index levels were associated with an increased risk of 
in-hospital, 90-day and 360-day all-cause mortality as shown by Kaplan-Meier 
curves (log-rank P < 0.05). Cox regression analysis revealed that the highest 
postoperative SHR quartile was associated with a significantly higher risk of 
mortality at these time points (P < 0.05). RCS analysis demonstrated nonlinear 
relationships between the postoperative SHR index and all-cause mortality (P for 
nonlinear < 0.05). The Naive Bayes model achieves the highest area under the 
curve (AUC) for predicting both in-hospital mortality (0.7936) and 360-day 
all-cause mortality (0.7410).
CONCLUSION: In patients undergoing cardiac surgery, higher postoperative SHR 
index levels were significantly associated with increased risk of in-hospital, 
90-day and 360-day all-cause mortality. The SHR index may serve as a valid tool 
for assessing the severity after cardiac surgery and guiding treatment 
decisions.

BACKGROUND: Early detection and efficient management of sepsis are important for 
improving health care quality, effectiveness, and costs. Due to its high cost 
and prevalence, sepsis is a major focus area across institutions and many 
studies have emerged over the past years with different models or novel machine 
learning techniques in early detection of sepsis or potential mortality 
associated with sepsis.
OBJECTIVE: To understand predictive analytics solutions for sepsis patients, 
either in early detection of onset or mortality.
METHODS AND RESULTS: We performed a systematized narrative review and identified 
common and unique characteristics between their approaches and results in 
studies that used predictive analytics solutions for sepsis patients. After 
reviewing 148 retrieved papers, a total of 31 qualifying papers were analyzed 
with variances in model, including linear regression (n = 2), logistic 
regression (n = 5), support vector machines (n = 4), and Markov models (n = 4), 
as well as population (range: 24-198,833) and feature size (range: 2-285). Many 
of the studies used local data sets of varying sizes and locations while others 
used the publicly available Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care data. 
Additionally, vital signs or laboratory test results were commonly used as 
features for training and testing purposes; however, a few used more unique 
features including gene expression data from blood plasma and unstructured text 
and data from clinician notes.
CONCLUSION: Overall, we found variation in the domain of predictive analytics 
tools for septic patients, from feature and population size to choice of method 
or algorithm. There are still limitations in transferability and 
generalizability of the algorithms or methods used. However, it is evident that 
implementing predictive analytics tools are beneficial in the early detection of 
sepsis or death related to sepsis. Since most of these studies were 
retrospective, the translational value in the real-world setting in different 
wards should be further investigated.

BACKGROUND: Currently, a scarcity of prognostic research exists that 
concentrates on patients with nephrotic syndrome (NS) who also have 
tuberculosis. The purpose of this study was to assess the in-hospital mortality 
status of NS patients with tuberculosis, identify crucial risk factors, and 
create a sturdy prognostic prediction model that can improve disease evaluation 
and guide clinical decision-making.
METHODS: We utilized the Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care IV version 
2.2 (MIMIC-IV v2.2) database to include 1,063 patients with NS complicated by TB 
infection. Confounding factors included demographics, vital signs, laboratory 
indicators, and comorbidities. The Least Absolute Shrinkage and Selection 
Operator (LASSO) regression and the diagnostic experiment the receiver operating 
characteristic (ROC) curve analyses were used to select determinant variables. A 
nomogram was established by using a logistic regression model. The performance 
of the nomogram was tested and validated using the concordance index (C-index) 
of the ROC curve, calibration curves, internal cross-validation, and clinical 
decision curve analysis.
RESULTS: The cumulative in-hospital mortality rate for patients with NS and TB 
was 18.7%. A nomogram was created to predict in-hospital mortality, utilizing 
Alb, Bun, INR, HR, Abp, Resp., Glu, CVD, Sepsis-3, and AKI stage 7 days. The 
area under the curve of the receiver operating characteristic evaluation was 
0.847 (0.812-0.881), with a calibration curve slope of 1.00 (0.83-1.17) and a 
mean absolute error of 0.013. The cross-validated C-index was 0.860. The 
decision curves indicated that the patients benefited from this model when the 
risk threshold was 0.1 and 0.81.
CONCLUSION: Our clinical prediction model nomogram demonstrated a good 
predictive ability for in-hospital mortality among patients with NS combined 
with TB. Therefore, it can aid clinicians in assessing the condition, judging 
prognosis, and making clinical decisions for such patients.

BACKGROUND: Inflammation plays a crucial role in cerebrovascular disease (CVD) 
progression. Neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio (NLR) is an important inflammatory 
marker, though its diagnostic role in CVD is still under investigation. This 
study evaluates the relationship between NLR and short-term all-cause mortality 
in patients with CVD admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU).
METHODS: We conducted a retrospective study using data from the Medical 
Information Mart for Intensive Care (MIMIC-IV) (v2.2) database, including 4,327 
adult ICU-admitted CVD patients. NLR values at admission were analyzed alongside 
various mortality variables. Multivariate Cox proportional hazards regression 
models and Kaplan-Meier (K-M) survival curves assessed the relationship between 
NLR and short-term all-cause mortality. Predictive power, sensitivity, 
specificity, and area under the curve (AUC) of NLR for short-term mortality were 
investigated using Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) analysis. 
Additionally, restricted cubic spline (RCS) curves and subgroup analyses were 
conducted.
RESULTS: Among the 4,327 patients, 3,600 survived (survival group) and 727 died 
(non-survival group) within 28 days of admission (mortality rate: 16.8%). A 
multivariate Cox regression analysis identified NLR as an independent predictor 
of 28-day all-cause mortality (hazard ratio: 1.013; 95% confidence interval: 
1.0086-1.0188; p < 0.001). The predictive model, incorporating NLR, age, gender, 
BMI, Charlson comorbidity index (CCI), WBC counts, Platelet, INR, and CRP, 
achieved an AUC of 0.686 (95% confidence interval: 0.665-0.70). While 
platelet-to-lymphocyte ratio was also analyzed, its predictive efficiency was 
less pronounced compared to NLR. A best NLR threshold of 6.19 was determined, 
distinguishing survivors from non-survivors. Kaplan-Meier survival curves showed 
that patients with NLR ≥ 6.19 had significantly lower survival rates at 7-, 14-, 
21-, and 28-days. Subgroup analyses indicated that NLR did not significantly 
interact with most subgroups.
CONCLUSION: NLR may serve as an independent predictor for short-term all-cause 
mortality in ICU-admitted CVD patients, enhancing our understanding of the 
association between inflammatory biomarkers and CVD prognosis.

OBJECTIVE: This study aims to construct and compare four machine learning models 
using the MIMIC-IV database to identify high-risk factors for 
multidrug-resistant organism (MDRO) infection in Ventilator-associated pneumonia 
(VAP) patients.
METHODS: The study included 972 VAP patients from the MIMIC-IV database. Data 
encompassing demographic information, vital signs, laboratory results, and other 
relevant variables were collected. The class imbalance issue was addressed using 
the Synthetic Minority Over-sampling Technique (SMOTE). The dataset was randomly 
split into training and testing sets (8:2). LASSO regression and feature 
importance scores were used for feature selection. Clinical prediction models 
were built using logistic regression, XGBoost, random forest and gradient 
boosting machine. The performance of the models was evaluated through receiver 
operating characteristic(ROC) curve analysis.Model calibration was assessed 
using calibration curves and Brier scores. The effectiveness was evaluated 
through Decision Curve Analysis (DCA). SHAP was utilized for model 
interpretation.
RESULTS: Among 972 patients, 824 were non-MDROs-VAP and 128 were MDROs-VAP. 
Comparative analysis revealed statistically significant differences in various 
clinical parameters. XGBoost exhibited the best predictive performance, 
incorporating 20 features with an AUC of 0.831 (95 % CI: 0.785-0.877) on the 
test set. Calibration curves demonstrated robust consistency, corroborated by 
Decision Curve Analysis (DCA) affirming the clinical utility. SHAP analysis 
identified the most important features: red cell distribution width, duration of 
mechanical ventilation, anion gap, basophil percentage, and neutrophil 
percentage.
CONCLUSION: This study established and compared four machine learning models for 
MDROs infections in VAP patients. XGBoost was identified as the optimal 
predictor, and SHAP values provided insights into 20 independent risk factors, 
confirming its excellent predictive value.
IMPLICATIONS FOR CLINICAL PRACTICE: VAP is a common infection in ICU patients 
with a heightened risk of MDRO and increased mortality. The recognition of high 
bias in existing models calls for future research to employ rigorous 
methodologies and robust data sources, aiming to develop and validate more 
accurate and clinically applicable predictive models for MDROs infections in VAP 
patients.

Vasopressors are ubiquitous in intensive care units. While central venous 
catheters are the preferred route of infusion, recent evidence suggests 
peripheral administration may be safe for short, single-agent courses. Here, we 
identify risk factors and develop a predictive model for patient central venous 
catheter requirement using the Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care, a 
single-centre dataset of patients admitted to an intensive care unit between 
2008 and 2019. Using prior literature, a composite endpoint of prolonged 
single-agent courses (>24 hours) or multi-agent courses of any duration was used 
to identify likely central venous catheter requirement. From a cohort of 69,619 
intensive care unit stays, there were 17,053 vasopressor courses involving one 
or more vasopressors that met study inclusion criteria. In total, 3807 (22.3%) 
vasopressor courses involved a single vasopressor for less than six hours, 7952 
(46.6%) courses for less than 24 hours and 5757 (33.8%) involved multiple 
vasopressors of any duration. Of these, 3047 (80.0%) less than six-hour and 6423 
(80.8%) less than 24-hour single vasopressor courses used a central venous 
catheter. Logistic regression models identified associations between the 
composite endpoint and intubation (odds ratio (OR) 2.36, 95% confidence 
intervals (CI) 2.16 to 2.58), cardiac diagnosis (OR 0.72, CI 0.65 to 0.80), 
renal impairment (OR 1.61, CI 1.50 to 1.74), older age (OR 1.002, Cl 1.000 to 
1.005) and vital signs in the hour before initiation (heart rate, OR 1.006, CI 
1.003 to 1.009; oxygen saturation, OR 0.996, CI 0.993 to 0.999). A logistic 
regression model predicting the composite endpoint had an area under the 
receiver operating characteristic curve (standard deviation) of 0.747 (0.013) 
and an accuracy of 0.691 (0.012). This retrospective study reveals a high 
prevalence of short vasopressor courses in intensive care unit settings, a 
majority of which were administered using central venous catheters. We identify 
several important risk factors that may help guide clinicians deciding between 
peripheral and central venous catheter administration, and present a predictive 
model that may inform future prospective trials.

STUDY OBJECTIVE: The lactate-to-albumin ratio (LAR) has been confirmed to be an 
effective prognostic marker in sepsis, heart failure, and acute respiratory 
failure. However, the relationship between LAR and mortality in patients with 
acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) remains unclear. We aim to evaluate 
the predictive value of LAR for ARDS patients.
DESIGN: A retrospective cohort study.
SETTING: Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care IV (v2.2) database.
PATIENTS: 769 patients with acute respiratory distress syndrome(ARDS).
INTERVENTIONS: We divided the patients into two subgroups according to the 
primary study endpoint (28-days all-cause mortality): the 28-day survivors and 
the 28-day non-survivors.
MEASURES: Multivariate Cox Regression, Receiver Operator Characteristic (ROC) 
and Kaplan-Meier survival analysis were used to investigate the relationship 
between LAR and short-time mortality in patients with ARDS.
MAIN RESULTS: The 28-day mortality was 38 % in this study. Multivariable Cox 
regression analysis showed that LAR was an independent predictive factor for 
28-day mortality (HR 1.11, 95 %CI: 1.06-1.16, P < 0.001). The area under curve 
(AUC) of LAR in the ROC was 70.34 % (95 %CI: 66.53 % - 74.15 %) that provided 
significantly higher discrimination compared with lactate (AUC = 68.00 %, 
P = 0.0007) or albumin (AUC = 63.17 %, P = 0.002) alone. LAR was also not 
inferior to SAPSII with the AUC of 73.44 % (95 %CI: 69.84 % - 77.04 %, 
P = 0.21). Additionally, Kaplan-Meier survival analysis displayed that ARDS 
patients with high LAR (> the cut-off value 0.9055) had a significantly higher 
28-day overall mortality rate (P < 0.001) and in-hospital mortality rate 
(P < 0.001). However, patients in high LAR group had shorter length of hospital 
stay (P < 0.001), which might be caused by higher in-hospital mortality.
CONCLUSIONS: We confirmed that there was a positive correlation between LAR and 
28-day mortality. This could provide anesthesiologists and critical care 
physicians with a more convenient tool than SAPSII without being superior for 
detecting ARDS patients with poor prognosis timely.

BACKGROUND: The triglyceride-glucose (TyG) index, proven a reliable and simple 
surrogate of insulin resistance, has shown potential associations with 
cardiovascular outcomes and renal diseases. This research delved into the 
utility of the TyG index in predicting the risk of acute kidney injury (AKI) in 
patients with coronary artery disease (CAD), an area not extensively covered in 
existing literature.
METHODS: A cohort of patients with CAD was recruited from the Medical 
Information Mart for Intensive Care-IV database, and categorized into quartiles 
based on their TyG index. The primary outcome was AKI incidence, and the 
secondary outcome was renal replacement therapy (RRT). Scatterplot histograms, 
cox proportional hazards models, Kaplan-Meier survival curves, and restricted 
cubic splines were employed to investigate the association between the TyG index 
and the risk of AKI in patients with CAD.
RESULTS: A total of 1,501 patients were enrolled in this study, predominantly 
male (61.56%), with a median age of 69.80 years. The AKI incidence was 67.22% 
among all patients, with the AKI stages increased with higher TyG levels (P for 
trend <0.001). The Kaplan-Meier survival analyses demonstrated statistically 
significant differences in AKI incidence and RRT application throughout the 
entire cohort, stratified by the TyG index quartiles (p < 0.001). Additionally, 
the restricted cubic spline analysis revealed a non-linear association between 
the TyG index and the risk of AKI (P for non-linear =0.637). Both multivariate 
Cox proportional hazards analyses (HR 1.62; 95% CI 1.15-2.27; p = 0.005) and 
multivariate logistic regression analyses (OR 2.16; 95% CI 1.18-3.94; p = 0.012) 
showed that the elevated TyG index was significantly related to AKI incidence. 
The association between TyG index and the risk of AKI is more significant in 
patients without diabetes (HR 1.27; 95% CI 1.14-1.42; p < 0.001), compared to 
patients with diabetes (P for interaction =0.013).
CONCLUSIONS: In summary, the TyG index emerged as a reliable predictor for the 
occurrence of AKI in CAD patients during ICU stay. Furthermore, it is also 
anticipated to serve as a valuable indicator for non-diabetic patients in 
predicting the incidence of AKI.

This study aims to develop and validate a machine learning (ML) predictive model 
for assessing mortality in patients with malignant tumors and hyperkalemia 
(MTH). We extracted data on patients with MTH from the Medical Information Mart 
for Intensive Care-IV, version 2.2 (MIMIC-IV v2.2) database. The dataset was 
split into a training set (75%) and a validation set (25%). We used the Least 
Absolute Shrinkage and Selection Operator (LASSO) regression to identify 
potential predictors, which included clinical laboratory indicators and vital 
signs. Pearson correlation analysis tested the correlation between predictors. 
In-hospital death was the prediction target. The Area Under the Curve (AUC) and 
accuracy of the training and validation sets of 7 ML algorithms were compared, 
and the optimal 1 was selected to develop the model. The calibration curve was 
used to evaluate the prediction accuracy of the model further. SHapley Additive 
exPlanations (SHAP) and Local Interpretable Model-agnostic Explanations (LIME) 
enhanced model interpretability. 496 patients with MTH in the Intensive Care 
Unit (ICU) were included. After screening, 17 clinical features were included in 
the construction of the ML model, and the Pearson correlation coefficient was 
<0.8, indicating that the correlation between the clinical features was small. 
eXtreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost) outperformed other algorithms, achieving 
perfect scores in the training set (accuracy: 1.000, AUC: 1.000) and high scores 
in the validation set (accuracy: 0.734, AUC: 0.733). The calibration curves 
indicated good predictive calibration of the model. SHAP analysis identified the 
top 8 predictive factors: urine output, mean heart rate, maximum urea nitrogen, 
minimum oxygen saturation, minimum mean blood pressure, maximum total bilirubin, 
mean respiratory rate, and minimum pH. In addition, SHAP and LIME performed 
in-depth individual case analyses. This study demonstrates the effectiveness of 
ML methods in predicting mortality risk in ICU patients with MTH. It highlights 
the importance of predictors like urine output and mean heart rate. SHAP and 
LIME significantly enhanced the model's interpretability.

AIMS: Myocardial infarction and heart failure are major cardiovascular diseases 
that affect millions of people in the USA with morbidity and mortality being 
highest among patients who develop cardiogenic shock. Early recognition of 
cardiogenic shock allows prompt implementation of treatment measures. Our 
objective is to develop a new dynamic risk score, called CShock, to improve 
early detection of cardiogenic shock in the cardiac intensive care unit (ICU).
METHODS AND RESULTS: We developed and externally validated a deep learning-based 
risk stratification tool, called CShock, for patients admitted into the cardiac 
ICU with acute decompensated heart failure and/or myocardial infarction to 
predict the onset of cardiogenic shock. We prepared a cardiac ICU dataset using 
the Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care-III database by annotating with 
physician-adjudicated outcomes. This dataset which consisted of 1500 patients 
with 204 having cardiogenic/mixed shock was then used to train CShock. The 
features used to train the model for CShock included patient demographics, 
cardiac ICU admission diagnoses, routinely measured laboratory values and vital 
signs, and relevant features manually extracted from echocardiogram and left 
heart catheterization reports. We externally validated the risk model on the New 
York University (NYU) Langone Health cardiac ICU database which was also 
annotated with physician-adjudicated outcomes. The external validation cohort 
consisted of 131 patients with 25 patients experiencing cardiogenic/mixed shock. 
CShock achieved an area under the receiver operator characteristic curve (AUROC) 
of 0.821 (95% CI 0.792-0.850). CShock was externally validated in the more 
contemporary NYU cohort and achieved an AUROC of 0.800 (95% CI 0.717-0.884), 
demonstrating its generalizability in other cardiac ICUs. Having an elevated 
heart rate is most predictive of cardiogenic shock development based on Shapley 
values. The other top 10 predictors are having an admission diagnosis of 
myocardial infarction with ST-segment elevation, having an admission diagnosis 
of acute decompensated heart failure, Braden Scale, Glasgow Coma Scale, blood 
urea nitrogen, systolic blood pressure, serum chloride, serum sodium, and 
arterial blood pH.
CONCLUSION: The novel CShock score has the potential to provide automated 
detection and early warning for cardiogenic shock and improve the outcomes for 
millions of patients who suffer from myocardial infarction and heart failure.

BACKGROUND: Acute myocardial infarction (AMI) is one of the most severe 
cardiovascular diseases and is associated with a high risk of in-hospital 
mortality. However, the current deep learning models for in-hospital mortality 
prediction lack interpretability.
OBJECTIVE: This study aims to establish an explainable deep learning model to 
provide individualized in-hospital mortality prediction and risk factor 
assessment for patients with AMI.
METHODS: In this retrospective multicenter study, we used data for consecutive 
patients hospitalized with AMI from the Chongqing University Central Hospital 
between July 2016 and December 2022 and the Electronic Intensive Care Unit 
Collaborative Research Database. These patients were randomly divided into 
training (7668/10,955, 70%) and internal test (3287/10,955, 30%) data sets. In 
addition, data of patients with AMI from the Medical Information Mart for 
Intensive Care database were used for external validation. Deep learning models 
were used to predict in-hospital mortality in patients with AMI, and they were 
compared with linear and tree-based models. The Shapley Additive Explanations 
method was used to explain the model with the highest area under the receiver 
operating characteristic curve in both the internal test and external validation 
data sets to quantify and visualize the features that drive predictions.
RESULTS: A total of 10,955 patients with AMI who were admitted to Chongqing 
University Central Hospital or included in the Electronic Intensive Care Unit 
Collaborative Research Database were randomly divided into a training data set 
of 7668 (70%) patients and an internal test data set of 3287 (30%) patients. A 
total of 9355 patients from the Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care 
database were included for independent external validation. In-hospital 
mortality occurred in 8.74% (670/7668), 8.73% (287/3287), and 9.12% (853/9355) 
of the patients in the training, internal test, and external validation cohorts, 
respectively. The Self-Attention and Intersample Attention Transformer model 
performed best in both the internal test data set and the external validation 
data set among the 9 prediction models, with the highest area under the receiver 
operating characteristic curve of 0.86 (95% CI 0.84-0.88) and 0.85 (95% CI 
0.84-0.87), respectively. Older age, high heart rate, and low body temperature 
were the 3 most important predictors of increased mortality, according to the 
explanations of the Self-Attention and Intersample Attention Transformer model.
CONCLUSIONS: The explainable deep learning model that we developed could provide 
estimates of mortality and visual contribution of the features to the prediction 
for a patient with AMI. The explanations suggested that older age, unstable 
vital signs, and metabolic disorders may increase the risk of mortality in 
patients with AMI.

Immune cells and immunity are associated with the prognosis of patients with 
critical illness. Here, medical records retrospectively extracted from the 
Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care IV were used for screening an 
immune-related biomarker in intensive care units (ICU) patients and applied for 
validating the identified indicator in septic patients. In this work, the count 
of innate immune cells, basophils, harbored a superior role in predicting ICU 
patients' prognosis compared with those of other blood immune cells (OR 0.013, 
95% CI 0.001, 0.118, P < 0.001). Importantly, basophils absence during ICU stay 
was positively correlated with the 28-day mortality of ICU patients and served 
as an independent predictor of ICU patients' prognosis (OR 3.425, 95% CI 
3.717-3.165, P < 0.001). Moreover, the association between critical illness 
progression, poor outcome, and basophils absence was verified in septic 
patients. Subsequent investigations revealed the positive relationship between 
basophils absence and immunosuppression, and suggested the potential of 
basophils-mediated immunity in predicting the 28-day mortality of ICU patients. 
Collectively, we identify basophils absence during ICU stay as a novel and 
unfavorable indicator for evaluating the prognosis of ICU patients and 
recognizing a branch of ICU patients potentially suitable for intensified 
treatment and immunoenhancement therapy.

BACKGROUND: While serum Ca has proven to be a reliable predictor of mortality 
across various diseases, its connection with the clinical outcomes of ischemic 
stroke (IS) remains inconclusive. Our research aimed to explore the 
relationships between serum total Ca (tCa) and serum ionized Ca (iCa) and 
mortality among acute IS (AIS) patients.
METHODS: We gathered data from 1773 AIS patients in the Medical Information Mart 
for Intensive Care Database IV, including baseline demographic data, 
comorbidities, vital signs, laboratory-based data, and scoring systems. 
Endpoints for the study encompassed 30-d, 90-d, and 365-d all-cause mortalities. 
Employing restricted cubic spline Cox regression, we explored potential 
nonlinear relationships between admission serum iCa and tCa levels and 
mortality. Participants were categorized into four groups based on serum iCa and 
tCa quartiles. Multivariable Cox regression analysis was then conducted to 
evaluate the independent association of iCa and tCa quartiles with all-cause 
mortality.
RESULTS: The restricted cubic spline revealed a U-shaped association between iCa 
and 30-d and 90-d mortality (P<0.05), while the relationship between iCa and 
365-d mortality was linear (P<0.05). After adjusting for confounders, 
multivariable Cox analysis demonstrated that the lowest serum iCa level quartile 
was independently associated with increased risks of 30-d, 90-d, and 365-d 
mortality. Similarly, the highest serum iCa level quartile was independently 
associated with increased risks of 30-d and 90-d mortality, but not 365-d 
mortality. Notably, serum tCa level showed no association with increased risks 
of 30-d, 90-d, and 365-d mortality.
CONCLUSIONS: Our findings suggest that serum iCa, rather than tCa, is linked to 
ischemic stroke prognosis. Both high and low serum iCa levels are associated 
with poor short-term prognosis, while only low serum iCa is associated with poor 
long-term prognosis in AIS patients.

BACKGROUND: Septic shock (SS) is a syndrome with high mortality. Early 
forewarning and diagnosis of SS, which are critical in reducing mortality, are 
still challenging in clinical management.
OBJECTIVE: We propose a simple and fast risk-stratified forewarning model for SS 
to help physicians recognize patients in time. Moreover, further insights can be 
gained from the application of the model to improve our understanding of SS.
METHODS: A total of 5125 patients with sepsis from the Medical Information Mart 
for Intensive Care-IV (MIMIC-IV) database were divided into training, 
validation, and test sets. In addition, 2180 patients with sepsis from the eICU 
Collaborative Research Database (eICU) were used as an external validation set. 
We developed a simplified risk-stratified early forewarning model for SS based 
on the weight of evidence and logistic regression, which was compared with 
multi-feature complex models, and clinical characteristics among risk groups 
were evaluated.
RESULTS: Using only vital signs and rapid arterial blood gas test features 
according to feature importance, we constructed the Septic Shock Risk Predictor 
(SORP), with an area under the curve (AUC) of 0.9458 in the test set, which is 
only slightly lower than that of the optimal multi-feature complex model 
(0.9651). A median forewarning time of 13 hours was calculated for SS patients. 
4 distinct risk groups (high, medium, low, and ultralow) were identified by the 
SORP 6 hours before onset, and the incidence rates of SS in the 4 risk groups in 
the postonset interval were 88.6% (433/489), 34.5% (262/760), 2.5% (67/2707), 
and 0.3% (4/1301), respectively. The severity increased significantly with 
increasing risk in both clinical features and survival. Clustering analysis 
demonstrated a high similarity of pathophysiological characteristics between the 
high-risk patients without SS diagnosis (NS_HR) and the SS patients, while a 
significantly worse overall survival was shown in NS_HR patients. On further 
exploring the characteristics of the treatment and comorbidities of the NS_HR 
group, these patients demonstrated a significantly higher incidence of mean 
blood pressure <65 mmHg, significantly lower vasopressor use and infused volume, 
and more severe renal dysfunction. The above findings were further validated by 
multicenter eICU data.
CONCLUSIONS: The SORP demonstrated accurate forewarning and a reliable risk 
stratification capability. Among patients forewarned as high risk, similar 
pathophysiological phenotypes and high mortality were observed in both those 
subsequently diagnosed as having SS and those without such a diagnosis. NS_HR 
patients, overlooked by the Sepsis-3 definition, may provide further insights 
into the pathophysiological processes of SS onset and help to complement its 
diagnosis and precise management. The importance of precise fluid resuscitation 
management in SS patients with renal dysfunction is further highlighted. For 
convenience, an online service for the SORP has been provided.

This study aimed to investigate the association between serum chloride levels 
and all-cause mortality in critically ill patients with chronic obstructive 
pulmonary disease (COPD). Data from the Medical Information Mart for Intensive 
Care IV (MIMIC-IV) database were extracted for analysis. Demographic 
information, laboratory results, medical histories, vital signs, and 
prognosis-related data were collected. Cox proportional hazard models were used 
to assess the relationship between serum chloride levels and 90-day and 365-day 
mortality. Subgroup analyses were conducted to explore potential interactions 
between serum chloride levels and various factors. The study included patients 
with a median age of 72.00 years, of whom 52.39% were male. Higher quartiles of 
serum chloride levels were associated with significantly lower levels of weight, 
RBC, platelet, hemoglobin, and other variables (P < 0.05), accompanied by lower 
90-day and 365-day mortality (P < 0.05). Cox proportional hazard model indicated 
that the risk of death was significantly lower in the fourth quartile of serum 
chloride levels compared with the first quartile after adjusting for confounders 
(90-day HR = 0.54, 365-day HR = 0.52, both P < 0.05). An L-shape relationship 
was observed, with risks of death decreasing as serum chloride levels increased, 
although the magnitude decreased when levels reached 102 mmol/L. This study 
demonstrated an independent L-shaped association between serum chloride levels 
and all-cause mortality in critically ill patients with COPD. This finding helps 
us to understand the prognostic value of serum chloride levels in critically ill 
patients with COPD.

Background: Traumatic brain injury-induced coagulopathy (TBI-IC), is a disease 
with poor prognosis and increased mortality rate. Objectives: Our study aimed to 
identify predictors as well as develop machine learning (ML) models to predict 
the risk of coagulopathy in this population. Methods: ML models were developed 
and validated based on two public databases named Medical Information Mart for 
Intensive Care (MIMIC)-IV and the eICU Collaborative Research Database 
(eICU-CRD). Candidate predictors, including demographics, family history, 
comorbidities, vital signs, laboratory findings, injury type, therapy strategy 
and scoring system were included. Models were compared on area under the curve 
(AUC), accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, positive and negative predictive 
values, and decision curve analysis (DCA) curve. Results: Of 999 patients in 
MIMIC-IV included in the final cohort, a total of 493 (49.35%) patients 
developed coagulopathy following TBI. Recursive feature elimination (RFE) 
selected 15 variables, including international normalized ratio (INR), 
prothrombin time (PT), sepsis related organ failure assessment (SOFA), activated 
partial thromboplastin time (APTT), platelet (PLT), hematocrit (HCT), red blood 
cell (RBC), hemoglobin (HGB), blood urea nitrogen (BUN), red blood cell volume 
distribution width (RDW), creatinine (CRE), congestive heart failure, myocardial 
infarction, sodium, and blood transfusion. The external validation in eICU-CRD 
demonstrated that adapting boosting (Ada) model had the highest AUC of 0.924 
(95% CI: 0.902-0.943). Furthermore, in the DCA curve, the Ada model and the 
extreme Gradient Boosting (XGB) model had relatively higher net benefits (ie, 
the correct classification of coagulopathy considering a trade-off between 
false- negatives and false-positives)-over other models across a range of 
threshold probability values. Conclusions: The ML models, as indicated by our 
study, can be used to predict the incidence of TBI-IC in the intensive care unit 
(ICU).

BACKGROUND: Cardiogenic shock (CS) is a severe cardiac disorder with a high 
mortality rate. The triglyceride-glucose (TyG) index, a biomarker of insulin 
resistance, is associated with cardiovascular disease-related mortality. This 
study aimed to investigate the association between the TyG index and mortality 
in patients with CS.
METHODS: This retrospective cohort study analyzed 727 patients with CS from the 
Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care IV database. The TyG index was 
calculated as follows: ln[triglycerides (mg/dL) × fasting blood glucose 
(mg/dL)/2]. Outcomes included 28-day intensive care unit (ICU) mortality and 
28-day in-hospital mortality. Kaplan-Meier survival curve models and Cox 
proportional hazards regression models were used to evaluate the prognostic 
significance of the TyG index. Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) curve 
analysis was used to determine the predictive efficacy of the TyG index for 
mortality. Subgroup analyses were conducted to determine the association between 
the TyG index and mortality across different groups.
RESULTS: Non-survivors had a significantly higher TyG index (ICU: 9.30 vs. 9.13, 
p = 0.008; in-hospital: 9.29 vs. 9.13, p = 0.004). Adjusted Cox models showed 
that each 1-unit increase in the TyG index increased ICU mortality risk by 24% 
(hazard ratio [HR] = 1.24, 95% confidence interval [CI]:1.04-1.48; p = 0.015) 
and in-hospital mortality by 44% (HR = 1.44, 95% CI:1.11-1.88; p = 0.007). The 
Quartile 4 TyG index ICU mortality was increased by 77% (HR = 1.77, 95% 
CI:1.09-2.89) compared to that for Quartile 1 and in-hospital mortality was 
increased by 61% (HR = 1.61, 95% CI:1.08-2.38). The area under the ROC curve 
(AUROC) showed a modest standalone predictive ability of 0.56, but when combined 
with clinical variables, the AUROC improved to 0.80 (ICU) and 0.78 
(in-hospital). Subgroup analyses identified stronger associations in 
patients ≥ 60 years, females, non-septic, and those with acute myocardial 
infarction or heart failure.
CONCLUSIONS: The TyG index is significantly associated with short-term mortality 
in patients with CS and may serve as a useful biomarker for risk stratification.

Effective utilization of premium hospital resources such as intensive care unit 
(ICU), operating theater (OT), mechanical ventilator, endotracheal tube, and so 
on plays a significant role in providing high-quality care to critically ill 
patients within reasonable costs. Non-availability of specialized resources can 
lead to dire consequences for such patients, and in the worst case, may even 
turn out to be fatal. However, these resources cannot be kept idle, as they are 
expensive to maintain. Therefore, one of the core functions of hospital 
management is targeted at planning and managing these critical resources in 
order to provide efficient and effective health-care services to the end-users. 
Predictive technologies play a big role in this. In this article, we present 
methods for predicting the length of stay in ICU as well as the need for 
critical interventions for a patient based on the vital signs, laboratory 
measurements, and the nursing notes of the patient prepared within the first 
24 h of ICU stay. The model has been built and cross-validated on the publicly 
available Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care (MIMIC-III v1.4) data set. 
We show that the proposed model performs way better than most of the earlier 
models in the prediction of ICU stay, which had used patient vitals primarily. 
Experimental results also demonstrate the advantage of using a multiobjective 
model over independent models for the prediction of ICU stay and critical 
interventions. The proposed model uses Local Interpretable Model-agnostic 
Explanations (LIME) that help in identifying the features responsible for 
predictive decisions. This is very useful in building trust and confidence in 
the prediction model among clinical practitioners.

Background: Mechanically ventilated patients in the intensive care unit (ICU) 
have high mortality rates. There are multiple prediction scores, such as the 
Simplified Acute Physiology Score II (SAPS II), Oxford Acute Severity of Illness 
Score (OASIS), and Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (SOFA), widely used in 
the general ICU population. We aimed to establish prediction scores on 
mechanically ventilated patients with the combination of these disease severity 
scores and other features available on the first day of admission. Methods: A 
retrospective administrative database study from the Medical Information Mart 
for Intensive Care (MIMIC-III) database was conducted. The exposures of interest 
consisted of the demographics, pre-ICU comorbidity, ICU diagnosis, disease 
severity scores, vital signs, and laboratory test results on the first day of 
ICU admission. Hospital mortality was used as the outcome. We used the machine 
learning methods of k-nearest neighbors (KNN), logistic regression, bagging, 
decision tree, random forest, Extreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost), and neural 
network for model establishment. A sample of 70% of the cohort was used for the 
training set; the remaining 30% was applied for testing. Areas under the 
receiver operating characteristic curves (AUCs) and calibration plots would be 
constructed for the evaluation and comparison of the models' performance. The 
significance of the risk factors was identified through models and the top 
factors were reported. Results: A total of 28,530 subjects were enrolled through 
the screening of the MIMIC-III database. After data preprocessing, 25,659 adult 
patients with 66 predictors were included in the model analyses. With the 
training set, the models of KNN, logistic regression, decision tree, random 
forest, neural network, bagging, and XGBoost were established and the testing 
set obtained AUCs of 0.806, 0.818, 0.743, 0.819, 0.780, 0.803, and 0.821, 
respectively. The calibration curves of all the models, except for the neural 
network, performed well. The XGBoost model performed best among the seven 
models. The top five predictors were age, respiratory dysfunction, SAPS II 
score, maximum hemoglobin, and minimum lactate. Conclusion: The current study 
indicates that models with the risk of factors on the first day could be 
successfully established for predicting mortality in ventilated patients. The 
XGBoost model performs best among the seven machine learning models.

BACKGROUND: Both in-hospital cardiac arrest (IHCA) and out-of-hospital cardiac 
arrest (OHCA) have higher incidence and lower survival rates. Predictors of 
in-hospital mortality for intensive care unit (ICU) admitted cardiac arrest (CA) 
patients remain unclear.
METHODS: The Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care IV (MIMIC-IV) database 
was used to perform a retrospective study. Patients meeting the inclusion 
criteria were identified from the MIMIC-IV database and randomly divided into 
training set (n = 1206, 70%) and validation set (n = 516, 30%). Candidate 
predictors consisted of the demographics, comorbidity, vital signs, laboratory 
test results, scoring systems, and treatment information on the first day of ICU 
admission. Independent risk factors for in-hospital mortality were screened 
using the least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) regression 
model and the extreme gradient boosting (XGBoost) in the training set. 
Multivariate logistic regression analysis was used to build prediction models in 
training set, and then validated in validation set. Discrimination, calibration 
and clinical utility of these models were compared using the area under the 
curve (AUC) of the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves, calibration 
curves and decision curve analysis (DCA). After pairwise comparison, the best 
performing model was chosen to build a nomogram.
RESULTS: Among the 1722 patients, in-hospital mortality was 53.95%. In both 
sets, the LASSO, XGBoost,the logistic regression(LR) model and the National 
Early Warning Score 2 (NEWS 2) models showed acceptable discrimination. In 
pairwise comparison, the prediction effectiveness was higher with the 
LASSO,XGBoost and LR models than the NEWS 2 model (p < 0.001). The LASSO,XGBoost 
and LR models also showed good calibration. The LASSO model was chosen as our 
final model for its higher net benefit and wider threshold range. And the LASSO 
model was presented as the nomogram.
CONCLUSIONS: The LASSO model enabled good prediction of in-hospital mortality in 
ICU admission CA patients, which may be widely used in clinical decision-making.

BACKGROUND: To evaluate the association of coagulation disorder score with the 
risk of in-hospital mortality in acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) 
patients.
METHODS: In this cohort study, 7,001 adult patients with ARDS were identified 
from the Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care Database-IV (MIMIC-IV). 
Univariate and multivariate Logistic stepwise regression models were used to 
explore the associations of coagulation-associated biomarkers with the risk of 
in-hospital mortality in patients with ADRS. Restricted cubic spline (RCS) was 
plotted to explore the association between coagulation disorder score and 
in-hospital mortality of ARDS patients.
RESULTS: The follow-up time for in-hospital death was 7.15 (4.62, 13.88) days. 
There were 1,187 patients died and 5,814 people survived in hospital. After 
adjusting for confounding factors, increased risk of in-hospital mortality in 
ARDS patients was observed in those with median coagulation disorder score [odds 
ratio (OR) = 1.22, 95% confidence interval (CI): 1.01-1.47) and high coagulation 
disorder score (OR = 1.38, 95% CI: 1.06-1.80). The results of RCS indicated that 
when the coagulation disorder score >2, the trend of in-hospital mortality rose 
gradually, and OR was >1.
CONCLUSIONS: Poor coagulation function was associated with increased risk of 
in-hospital mortality in ARDS patients. The findings implied that clinicians 
should regularly detect the levels of coagulation-associated biomarkers for the 
management of ARDS patients.

BACKGROUND: The triglyceride-glucose (TyG) index, renowned for its efficacy and 
convenience in assessing insulin resistance, has been validated as a reliable 
indicator for various cardiovascular conditions. The current study aims for 
clarifying the link of TyG with the incidences and prognoses of cardiac arrest 
(CA) following acute myocardial infarction (AMI).
METHODS: Our analysis is a multicenter, retrospective study utilizing data from 
the Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care IV and the eICU Collaborative 
Research Database. Patients with AMI for whom TyG could be calculated within the 
first 24 h after admission were included. The main endpoints were in-hospital 
and ICU mortalities. Correlations between TyG and outcomes were evaluated using 
logistic regression models, restricted cubic splines (RCS), as well as 
correlation and linear analyses. Overlap weighting (OW), inverse probability of 
treatment weighting (IPTW), and propensity score matching (PSM) methodologies 
were utilized to balance the cohorts, thereby minimizing potential biases. 
Subgroup analyses were performed in accordance with identified modifiers.
RESULTS: In total, 5208 individuals diagnosed with AMI, among whom 371 developed 
CA, were ultimately included. Higher TyG levels were observed among AMI 
populations with CA compared to those without [9.2 (8.7-9.7) vs. 9.0 (8.5-9.4)], 
and TyG demonstrated a moderate discriminatory capacity for identifying CA 
occurrences within entire AMI populations. Multivariate logistic regressions 
revealed TyG serves a significant risk indicator for both in-hospital (OR 1.711) 
and ICU mortalities (OR 1.520) in AMI-CA patients, and it is also associated 
with prolonged LOSs. RCS analyses confirmed linear relationships of ascending 
TyG with increased mortality risks for AMI-CA (P for nonlinearity: 0.592 and 
0.816, respectively), which persisted following PSM, OW, and IPTW adjustments. 
Subgroup analyses further identified a strong link of the TyG with mortality 
rates among elders, females, individuals with BMI < 28 kg/m2, and those with 
hypertension.
CONCLUSIONS: Elevated TyG levels were found to apparently correlate with higher 
prevalence and adverse outcomes regarding CA in patients with AMI. Our findings 
point a fresh insight into the significance of the TyG in critically ill 
coronary conditions.

OBJECTIVE: To explore the relationship between lactate-to-albumin ratio (LAR) at 
ICU admission and prognosis in critically ill patients with acute kidney injury 
(AKI).
METHODS: A retrospective analysis was conducted. Patients were divided into low 
(<0.659) LAR and high LAR (≥0.659) groups. Least absolute shrinkage and 
selection operator regression analysis was conducted to select variables 
associated with the 30-day prognosis. Cox regression analyses were performed to 
assess the association between LAR and mortality. Kaplan-Meier curves were 
plotted to compare cumulative survival rates between high and low LAR groups. 
Subgroup analysis was employed to assess the stability of the results. ROC curve 
was used to determine the diagnostic efficacy of LAR on prognosis.
RESULTS: A nonlinear relationship was observed between LAR and the risk of 
30-day and 360-day all-cause mortality in AKI patients (p < 0.001). Cox 
regulation showed that high LAR (≥ 0.659) was an independent risk factor for 
30-day and 360-day all-cause mortality in patients with AKI (p < 0.001). The 
Kaplan-Meier survival curves demonstrated a noteworthy decrease in cumulative 
survival rates at both 30 and 360 days for the high LAR group in comparison to 
the low LAR group (p < 0.001). Subgroup analyses demonstrated the stability of 
the results. ROC curves showed that LAR had a diagnostic advantage when compared 
with lactate or albumin alone (p < 0.001).
CONCLUSION: High LAR (≥0.659) at ICU admission was an independent risk factor 
for both short-term (30-day) and long-term (360-day) all-cause mortality in 
patients with AKI.

OBJECTIVE: To explore the relationship between serum calcium levels and the 
prognosis of severe acute osteomyelitis, and to assess the effectiveness of 
calcium levels in prognostic evaluation.
METHODS: Relevant patient records of individuals diagnosed with severe acute 
osteomyelitis were obtained for this retrospective study from the Medical 
Information Mart for Intensive Care (MIMIC-IV). The study aimed to assess the 
impact of different indicators on prognosis by utilizing COX regression 
analysis. To enhance prognostic prediction for critically ill patients, a 
nomogram was developed. The discriminatory capacity of the nomogram was 
evaluated using the Area Under the Curve (AUC) of the Receiver Operating 
Characteristic (ROC) curve, in addition to the calibration curve.
RESULT: The study analyzed a total of 1,133 cases of severe acute osteomyelitis, 
divided into the survivor group (1,025 cases) and the non-survivor group (108 
cases). Significant differences were observed between the two groups in terms of 
age, hypertension, sepsis, renal injury, and various laboratory indicators, 
including WBC, PLT, Ca2+, CRP, hemoglobin, albumin, and creatinine (P<0.05). 
However, no significant differences were found in race, gender, marital status, 
detection of wound microbiota, blood sugar, lactate, and ALP levels. A 
multivariate COX proportional hazards model was constructed using age, 
hypertension, sepsis, Ca2+, creatinine, albumin, and hemoglobin as variables. 
The results revealed that hypertension and sepsis had a significant impact on 
survival time (HR=0.514, 95% CI 0.339-0.779, P=0.002; HR=1.696, 95% CI 
1.056-2.723, P=0.029). Age, hemoglobin, Ca2+, albumin, and creatinine also 
showed significant effects on survival time (P<0.05). However, no statistically 
significant impact on survival time was observed for the other variables 
(P>0.05). To predict the survival time, a nomogram was developed using the 
aforementioned indicators and achieved an AUC of 0.841. The accuracy of the 
nomogram was further confirmed by the ROC curve and calibration curve.
CONCLUSION: According to the findings, this study establishes that a reduction 
in serum calcium levels serves as a distinct and standalone predictor of 
mortality among individuals diagnosed with severe acute osteomyelitis during 
their stay in the Intensive Care Unit (ICU) within a span of two years.

Databases that link molecular data to clinical outcomes can inform precision 
cancer research into novel prognostic and predictive biomarkers. However, 
outside of clinical trials, cancer outcomes are typically recorded only in text 
form within electronic health records (EHRs). Artificial intelligence (AI) 
models have been trained to extract outcomes from individual EHRs. However, 
patient privacy restrictions have historically precluded dissemination of these 
models beyond the centers at which they were trained. In this study, the 
vulnerability of text classification models trained directly on protected health 
information to membership inference attacks is confirmed. A teacher-student 
distillation approach is applied to develop shareable models for annotating 
outcomes from imaging reports and medical oncologist notes. 'Teacher' models 
trained on EHR data from Dana-Farber Cancer Institute (DFCI) are used to label 
imaging reports and discharge summaries from the Medical Information Mart for 
Intensive Care (MIMIC)-IV dataset. 'Student' models are trained to use these 
MIMIC documents to predict the labels assigned by teacher models and sent to 
Memorial Sloan Kettering (MSK) for evaluation. The student models exhibit high 
discrimination across outcomes in both the DFCI and MSK test sets. Leveraging 
private labeling of public datasets to distill publishable clinical AI models 
from academic centers could facilitate deployment of machine learning to 
accelerate precision oncology research.

BACKGROUND: Lactic acidosis is a heterogeneous condition with multiple 
underlying causes and associated outcomes. The use of multi-dimensional patient 
data to subtype lactic acidosis can personalize patient care. Machine learning 
consensus clustering may identify lactic acidosis subgroups with unique clinical 
profiles and outcomes.
METHODS: We used the Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care III database to 
abstract electronic medical record data from patients admitted to intensive care 
units (ICU) in a tertiary care hospital in the United States. We included 
patients who developed lactic acidosis (defined as serum lactate ≥ 4 mmol/L) 
within 48 h of ICU admission. We performed consensus clustering analysis based 
on patient characteristics, comorbidities, vital signs, organ supports, and 
laboratory data to identify clinically distinct lactic acidosis subgroups. We 
calculated standardized mean differences to show key subgroup features. We 
compared outcomes among subgroups.
RESULTS: We identified 1919 patients with lactic acidosis. The algorithm 
revealed three best unique lactic acidosis subgroups based on patient variables. 
Cluster 1 (n = 554) was characterized by old age, elective admission to cardiac 
surgery ICU, vasopressor use, mechanical ventilation use, and higher pH and 
serum bicarbonate. Cluster 2 (n = 815) was characterized by young age, admission 
to trauma/surgical ICU with higher blood pressure, lower comorbidity burden, 
lower severity index, and less vasopressor use. Cluster 3 (n = 550) was 
characterized by admission to medical ICU, history of liver disease and 
coagulopathy, acute kidney injury, lower blood pressure, higher comorbidity 
burden, higher severity index, higher serum lactate, and lower pH and serum 
bicarbonate. Cluster 3 had the worst outcomes, while cluster 1 had the most 
favorable outcomes in terms of persistent lactic acidosis and mortality.
CONCLUSIONS: Consensus clustering analysis synthesized the pattern of clinical 
and laboratory data to reveal clinically distinct lactic acidosis subgroups with 
different outcomes.

BACKGROUND: Cardiac arrest (CA) is one of the leading causes of death among 
patients in the intensive care unit (ICU). Although many CA prediction models 
with high sensitivity have been developed to anticipate CA, their practical 
application has been challenging due to a lack of generalization and validation. 
Additionally, the heterogeneity among patients in different ICU subtypes has not 
been adequately addressed.
OBJECTIVE: This study aims to propose a clinically interpretable ensemble 
approach for the timely and accurate prediction of CA within 24 hours, 
regardless of patient heterogeneity, including variations across different 
populations and ICU subtypes. Additionally, we conducted patient-independent 
evaluations to emphasize the model's generalization performance and analyzed 
interpretable results that can be readily adopted by clinicians in real-time.
METHODS: Patients were retrospectively analyzed using data from the Medical 
Information Mart for Intensive Care-IV (MIMIC-IV) and the eICU-Collaborative 
Research Database (eICU-CRD). To address the problem of underperformance, we 
constructed our framework using feature sets based on vital signs, 
multiresolution statistical analysis, and the Gini index, with a 12-hour window 
to capture the unique characteristics of CA. We extracted 3 types of features 
from each database to compare the performance of CA prediction between high-risk 
patient groups from MIMIC-IV and patients without CA from eICU-CRD. After 
feature extraction, we developed a tabular network (TabNet) model using feature 
screening with cost-sensitive learning. To assess real-time CA prediction 
performance, we used 10-fold leave-one-patient-out cross-validation and a 
cross-data set method. We evaluated MIMIC-IV and eICU-CRD across different 
cohort populations and subtypes of ICU within each database. Finally, external 
validation using the eICU-CRD and MIMIC-IV databases was conducted to assess the 
model's generalization ability. The decision mask of the proposed method was 
used to capture the interpretability of the model.
RESULTS: The proposed method outperformed conventional approaches across 
different cohort populations in both MIMIC-IV and eICU-CRD. Additionally, it 
achieved higher accuracy than baseline models for various ICU subtypes within 
both databases. The interpretable prediction results can enhance clinicians' 
understanding of CA prediction by serving as a statistical comparison between 
non-CA and CA groups. Next, we tested the eICU-CRD and MIMIC-IV data sets using 
models trained on MIMIC-IV and eICU-CRD, respectively, to evaluate 
generalization ability. The results demonstrated superior performance compared 
with baseline models.
CONCLUSIONS: Our novel framework for learning unique features provides stable 
predictive power across different ICU environments. Most of the interpretable 
global information reveals statistical differences between CA and non-CA groups, 
demonstrating its utility as an indicator for clinical decisions. Consequently, 
the proposed CA prediction system is a clinically validated algorithm that 
enables clinicians to intervene early based on CA prediction information and can 
be applied to clinical trials in digital health.

PURPOSE: High levels of red blood cell distribution width (RDW) and 
hypoalbuminemia are markers of poor prognosis in chronic obstructive pulmonary 
disease (COPD) patients. However, few studies have shown that the red blood cell 
distribution width-albumin ratio (RAR) is related to the mortality of COPD. This 
study aimed to explore the relationship between RAR and hospital mortality in 
COPD patients admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU).
PATIENTS AND METHODS: Patients were retrospectively incorporated from the 
Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care IV (MIMIC-IV) database and divided 
into two groups by a cutoff value of RAR. Propensity score matching (PSM) was 
performed to adjust for the imbalance of covariates. Logistic regression models 
and subgroup analyses were carried out to investigate the relationship between 
RAR and hospital mortality. The receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve 
was used to evaluate the predictive performance of RAR and decision curve 
analysis (DCA) to assess the clinical utility.
RESULTS: In total, 1174 patients were finally identified from the MIMIC-IV 
database. The cutoff value for RAR was 5.315%/g/dL. After PSM at a 1:1 ratio, 
638 patients were included in the matched cohort. In the original and matched 
cohorts, the high RAR group had higher hospital mortality and longer hospital 
stays. Logistic regression analysis suggested that RAR was an independent risk 
factor for hospital mortality. The areas under the ROC curve in the original and 
matched cohorts were 0.706 and 0.611, respectively, which were larger than 
applying RDW alone (the original cohort: 0.600, the matched cohort: 0.514). The 
DCA indicated that RAR had a clinical utility.
CONCLUSION: A higher RAR (>5.315%/g/dL) was associated with hospital mortality 
in COPD patients admitted to ICU. As an easily available peripheral blood 
marker, RAR can predict hospital mortality in critically ill patients with COPD 
independently.

BACKGROUND: Using History and Physical Examination (H&P) notes, we investigated 
potential racial differences in documented chief complaints and problems among 
sepsis patients admitted to the intensive care unit.
METHODS: Patient records from Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care 
(MIMIC-III) dataset indicating a diagnosis of sepsis were included. First 
recorded clinical notes for each hospital admission were assessed; free text 
information was specifically extracted on (1) chief complaints, and (2) problems 
recorded in the Assessment & Plan (A&P) section. The top 10 for each were 
compared between Black and White patients.
RESULTS: In initial H&P notes of 17 434 sepsis patients (n = 1229 Black and 
n = 9806 White), the top 10 most common chief complaints were somewhat similar 
between Black and White patients. However, relative differences existed in terms 
of ranking, specifically for altered mental status which was more commonly 
reported in Black versus White patients (11.7% vs 7.8% P < .001). Among text in 
the A&P, sepsis was documented significantly less frequently among Black versus 
White patients: 11.8% versus 14.3%, P = .001. Racial differences were not 
detected in vital signs and laboratory values.
CONCLUSIONS: This analysis supports the hypothesis that there may be racial 
differences in early sepsis presentation and possible provider interpretation of 
these complaints.

Sepsis is a major cause of mortality among hospitalized patients. Existing 
sepsis prediction methods face limitations due to their reliance on laboratory 
results and Electronic Medical Records (EMRs). This work aimed to develop a 
sepsis prediction model utilizing continuous vital signs monitoring, offering an 
innovative approach to sepsis prediction. Data from 48,886 Intensive Care Unit 
(ICU) patient stays were extracted from the Medical Information Mart for 
Intensive Care -IV dataset. A machine learning model was developed to predict 
sepsis onset based solely on vital signs. The model's efficacy was compared with 
the existing scoring systems of SIRS, qSOFA, and a Logistic Regression model. 
The machine learning model demonstrated superior performance at 6 hrs prior to 
sepsis onset, achieving 88.1% sensitivity and 81.3% specificity, surpassing 
existing scoring systems. This novel approach offers clinicians a timely 
assessment of patients' likelihood of developing sepsis.

Predicting clinical patients' vital signs is a leading critical issue in 
intensive care units (ICUs) related studies. Early prediction of the mortality 
of ICU patients can reduce the overall mortality and cost of complication 
treatment. Some studies have predicted mortality based on electronic health 
record (EHR) data by using machine learning models. However, the semi-structured 
data (i.e., patients' diagnosis data and inspection reports) is rarely used in 
these models. This study utilized data from the Medical Information Mart for 
Intensive Care III. We used a Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) model to 
classify text in the semi-structured data of some particular topics and 
established and compared the classification and regression trees (CART), 
logistic regression (LR), multivariate adaptive regression splines (MARS), 
random forest (RF), and gradient boosting (GB). A total of 46,520 ICU Patients 
were included, with 11.5% mortality in the Medical Information Mart for 
Intensive Care III group. Our results revealed that the semi-structured data 
(diagnosis data and inspection reports) of ICU patients contain useful 
information that can assist clinical doctors in making critical clinical 
decisions. In addition, in our comparison of five machine learning models (CART, 
LR, MARS, RF, and GB), the GB model showed the best performance with the highest 
area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUROC) (0.9280), 
specificity (93.16%), and sensitivity (83.25%). The RF, LR, and MARS models 
showed better performance (AUROC are 0.9096, 0.8987, and 0.8935, respectively) 
than the CART (0.8511). The GB model showed better performance than other 
machine learning models (CART, LR, MARS, and RF) in predicting the mortality of 
patients in the intensive care unit. The analysis results could be used to 
develop a clinically useful decision support system.

OBJECTIVE: This study aims to construct and validate several machine learning 
(ML) algorithms to predict long-term mortality and identify risk factors in 
unselected patients post-cardiac surgery.
METHODS: The Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care (MIMIC-III) database 
was used to perform a retrospective administrative database study. Candidate 
predictors consisted of the demographics, comorbidity, vital signs, laboratory 
test results, scoring systems, and treatment information on the first day of ICU 
admission. Four-year mortality was set as the study outcome. We used the ML 
methods of logistic regression (LR), artificial neural network (NNET), naïve 
bayes (NB), gradient boosting machine (GBM), adapting boosting (Ada), random 
forest (RF), bagged trees (BT), and eXtreme Gradient Boosting (XGB). The 
prognostic capacity and clinical utility of these ML models were compared using 
the area under the receiver operating characteristic curves (AUC), calibration 
curves, and decision curve analysis (DCA).
RESULTS: Of 7,368 patients in MIMIC-III included in the final cohort, a total of 
1,337 (18.15%) patients died during a 4-year follow-up. Among 65 variables 
extracted from the database, a total of 25 predictors were selected using 
recursive feature elimination and included in the subsequent analysis. The Ada 
model performed best among eight models in both discriminatory ability with the 
highest AUC of 0.801 and goodness of fit (visualized by calibration curve). 
Moreover, the DCA shows that the net benefit of the RF, Ada, and BT models 
surpassed that of other ML models for almost all threshold probability values. 
Additionally, through the Ada technique, we determined that red blood cell 
distribution width (RDW), blood urea nitrogen (BUN), SAPS II, anion gap (AG), 
age, urine output, chloride, creatinine, congestive heart failure, and SOFA were 
the Top 10 predictors in the feature importance rankings.
CONCLUSIONS: The Ada model performs best in predicting 4-year mortality after 
cardiac surgery among the eight ML models, which might have significant 
application in the development of early warning systems for patients following 
operations.

BACKGROUND: Intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH) is a severe stroke subtype with a 
high mortality rate; the lactate-to-albumin ratio (LAR) is a new biomarker for 
predicting clinical outcomes in patients with ICH. However, the relationship 
between LAR and mortality in patients with ICH treated in the intensive care 
unit (ICU) remains controversial. Therefore, in this study, we aimed to 
investigate the association between LAR and in-hospital and ICU mortality in 
patients with ICH.
METHODS: Patients with ICH were selected from the Medical Information Mart for 
Intensive Care III (MIMIC-III) database; their clinical information, including 
baseline characteristics, vital signs, comorbidities, laboratory test results, 
and scoring systems, was extracted. Univariate and multivariate Cox proportional 
hazards analyses were used to investigate the association of LAR with 
in-hospital and ICU mortality. The maximum selection statistical method and 
subgroup analysis were used to investigate these relationships further. 
Kaplan-Meier (KM) analysis was used to draw survival curves.
RESULTS: This study enrolled 237 patients with ICH whose lactate and albumin 
levels, with median values of 1.975 and 3.6 mg/dl, respectively, were measured 
within the first 24 h after ICU admission. LAR had an association with increased 
risk of in-hospital mortality [unadjusted hazards ratio (HR), 1.79; 95% 
confidence interval (CI), 1.32-2.42; p < 0.001] and ICU mortality (unadjusted 
HR, 1.88; 95% CI, 1.38-2.55; p < 0.001). A cut-off value of 0.963 mg/dl was used 
to classify patients into high LAR (≥0.963) and low LAR (<0.963) groups, and 
survival curves suggested that those two groups had significant survival 
differences (p = 0.0058 and 0.0048, respectively). Furthermore, the high LAR 
group with ICH had a significantly increased risk of in-hospital and ICU 
mortality compared to the low LAR group.
CONCLUSION: Our study suggests that a high LAR is associated with an increased 
risk of in-hospital and ICU mortality in patients with ICH. Thus, the LAR is a 
useful prognostic predictor of clinical outcomes in patients with ICH.

BACKGROUND: Sepsis is a common and severe disease with a high mortality rate in 
intensive care unit (ICU). The hemoglobin (HGB) level is a key parameter for 
oxygen supply in sepsis. Although HGB is associated with the progression of 
inflammation in sepsis patients, its role as a marker following sepsis treatment 
remains unclear. Here, we studied the correlation between early temporal changes 
in HGB levels and long-term mortality rates in septic patients.
METHOD: In this retrospective study of data on patients with sepsis from the 
Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care (MIMIC) IV database, the outcome was 
long-term mortality. Patients were divided based on the cut-off of the HGB 
percentage for receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve calculation. 
Kaplan-Meier (KM) survival curves and Cox proportional hazards regression models 
were used to analyse the associations between groups and outcomes. Propensity 
score matching (PSM) was used to verify the results.
RESULTS: In this study, 2042 patients with sepsis and changes in HGB levels at 
day 4 after admission compared to day 1 were enrolled and divided into two 
groups: group 1 (n = 1147) for those with reduction of HGB < 7% and group 2 
(n = 895) for those with dropping ≥ 7%. The long-term survival chances of sepsis 
with less than a 7% reduction in the proportion of HGB at day four were 
significantly higher than those of patients in the group with a reduction of 7% 
or more. After adjusting for covariates in the Cox model, the hazard ratios 
(HRs) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) for long-term all-cause mortality in 
the group with a reduction of 7% or more were as follows: 180 days [HR = 1.41, 
95% CI (1.22 to 1.63), P < 0.001]; 360 days [HR = 1.37, 95% CI (1.21 to 1.56), 
P < 0.001]; 540 days [HR = 1.35, 95% CI (1.20 to 1.53), P < 0.001]; 720 days 
[HR = 1.45, 95% CI (1.29 to 1.64), P < 0.001]. Additionally, the long-term 
survival rates, using Kaplan-Meier analysis, for the group with a reduction of 
7% or more were lower compared to the group with less than 7% reduction at 
180 days (54.3% vs. 65.3%, P < 0.001), 360 days (42.3% vs. 50.9%, P < 0.001), 
540 days (40.2% vs. 48.6%, P < 0.001), and 720 days (35.5% vs. 46.1%, 
P < 0.001). The same trend was obtained after using PSM.
CONCLUSION: A ≥ 7% decrease in HGB levels on Day 4 after admission was 
associated with worse long-term prognosis in sepsis patients admitted to the 
ICU.

BACKGROUND: The triglyceride-glucose (TyG) index and stress hyperglycemia ratio 
(SHR) have been linked to the cardiovascular risks in critical ill patients. 
However, little is known about the predictive power of the TyG index, SHR and 
their combination on the incidence and mortality risks of new-onset atrial 
fibrillation (NOAF) in patients with sepsis.
METHOD: This retrospective study included patients from the Medical Information 
Mart for Intensive Care (MIMIC)-IV database. Primary outcomes were defined as 
the incidence and 360-day mortality of in-hospital NOAF among patients with 
sepsis. Logistic model, Cox proportional hazard model, Kaplan-Meier analysis and 
receiver-operating characteristic (ROC) were performed to explore the 
association between the indices and clinical outcomes. Machine learning approach 
also was constructed to evaluate and compare the indices in predicting mortality 
risks.
RESULTS: 4276 patients meeting the inclusion criteria were enrolled and 764 
individuals developed NOAF during hospitalization. The multivariable adjusted 
odds ratios (95%, CI) of incidence of NOAF in patients with sepsis in the 
highest group versus the lowest group were 1.36 (1.10-1.69), 1.35 (1.09-1.67) 
and 1.58 (1.23-2.02), respectively, for the TyG index, SHR and the TyG index-SHR 
combination. However, the predictive powers of these indices were relatively 
low. Among septic patients who developed in-hospital NOAF, those in the highest 
TyG index group and the highest SHR group exhibited an increased risk of 360-day 
mortality compared with those with the lowest TyG index and the lowest SHR (the 
TyG index: hazard ratio [HR] 1.59, 95% CI 1.00-2.62; SHR: HR 1.67, 95% CI 
1.03-2.70). Patients with both the highest the TyG index and the highest SHR 
demonstrated the highest risk of 360-day mortality (HR 1.72, 95% CI 1.08-2.72). 
The ROC also confirmed the TyG index-SHR combination had more robust predictive 
power for 360-day mortality among septic patients with NOAF than the TyG index 
and SHR itself (p < 0.05). The random forest model validated that the predictive 
capability was significantly enhanced with the integration of the TyG index and 
SHR.
CONCLUSION: The TyG index and SHR were associated with the incidence of 
in-hospital NOAF during sepsis, although their predictive powers were limited. 
In septic patients with in-hospital NOAF, high levels of the TyG index and SHR 
were significantly associated with increased 360-day mortality risks, with their 
combination demonstrating superior predictive power. Joint assessments of the 
TyG index and SHR could help identify individuals at high risks of mortality 
post-discharge, enabling clinicians to prioritize follow-up care and improve 
patient management.

BACKGROUND: Serum lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) is a nonspecific inflammatory 
biomarker and has been reported to be associated with pneumonia prognosis. This 
study aimed to evaluate the relationship between LDH levels and 
ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) risk in intensive care unit (ICU) 
patients.
METHODS: This retrospective cohort study used data from the Multiparameter 
Intelligent Monitoring in Intensive Care database from 2001 to 2019. ICU 
patients aged ≥ 18 years and receiving mechanical ventilation were included. LDH 
levels were analyzed as continuous and categorical variables (< 210, 210-279, 
279-390, > 390 IU/L), respectively. Restricted cubic spline (RCS) curves and 
quartiles were used to categorize LDH levels. Logistic regression and linear 
regression were utilized to assess the relationship of LDH levels with VAP risk 
and duration of mechanical ventilation, respectively.
RESULTS: A total of 9,164 patients were enrolled, of which 646 (7.05%) patients 
developed VAP. High levels of LDH increased the risk of VAP [odds ratio 
(OR) = 1.15, 95% confidence interval (CI): 1.06-1.24] and LDH levels were 
positively correlated with the duration of mechanical ventilation [β = 4.49, 
95%CI: (3.42, 5.56)]. Moreover, patients with LDH levels of 279-390 IU/L 
(OR = 1.38, 95%CI: 1.08-1.76) and > 390 IU/L (OR = 1.50, 95%CI: 1.18-1.90) had a 
higher risk of VAP than patients with LDH levels < 210 IU/L. Patients with LDH 
levels of 279-390 IU/L [β = 3.84, 95%CI: (0.86, 6.82)] and > 390 IU/L 
[β = 11.22, 95%CI: (8.21, 14.22)] (vs. <210 IU/L) had a longer duration of 
mechanical ventilation.
CONCLUSION: Elevated serum LDH levels were related to a higher risk of VAP and 
longer duration of mechanical ventilation and may be useful for monitoring VAP 
risk.

BACKGROUND: This study aimed to develop and validate an interpretable 
machine-learning model that utilizes clinical features and inflammatory 
biomarkers to predict the risk of in-hospital mortality in critically ill 
patients suffering from sepsis.
METHODS: We enrolled all patients diagnosed with sepsis in the Medical 
Information Mart for Intensive Care IV (MIMIC-IV, v.2.0), eICU Collaborative 
Research Care (eICU-CRD 2.0), and the Amsterdam University Medical Centers 
databases (AmsterdamUMCdb 1.0.2). LASSO regression was employed for feature 
selection. Seven machine-learning methods were applied to develop prognostic 
models. The optimal model was chosen based on its accuracy, F1 score and area 
under curve (AUC) in the validation cohort. Moreover, we utilized the SHapley 
Additive exPlanations (SHAP) method to elucidate the effects of the features 
attributed to the model and analyze how individual features affect the model's 
output. Finally, Spearman correlation analysis examined the associations among 
continuous predictor variables. Restricted cubic splines (RCS) explored 
potential non-linear relationships between continuous risk factors and 
in-hospital mortality.
RESULTS: 3535 patients with sepsis were eligible for participation in this 
study. The median age of the participants was 66 years (IQR, 55-77 years), and 
56% were male. After selection, 12 of the 45 clinical parameters collected on 
the first day after ICU admission remained associated with prognosis and were 
used to develop machine-learning models. Among seven constructed models, the 
eXtreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost) model achieved the best performance, with an 
AUC of 0.94 and an F1 score of 0.937 in the validation cohort. Feature 
importance analysis revealed that Age, AST, invasive ventilation treatment, and 
serum urea nitrogen (BUN) were the top four features of the XGBoost model with 
the most significant impact. Inflammatory biomarkers may have prognostic value. 
Furthermore, SHAP force analysis illustrated how the constructed model 
visualized the prediction of the model.
CONCLUSIONS: This study demonstrated the potential of machine-learning 
approaches for early prediction of outcomes in patients with sepsis. The SHAP 
method could improve the interoperability of machine-learning models and help 
clinicians better understand the reasoning behind the outcome.

The heterogeneity of critical illness complicates both clinical trial design and 
real-world management. This complexity has resulted in conflicting evidence and 
opinion regarding the optimal management in many intensive care scenarios. 
Understanding this heterogeneity is essential to tailoring management to 
individual patients. Hyperglycaemia is one such complication in the intensive 
care unit (ICU), accompanied by decades of conflicting evidence around 
management strategies. We hypothesized that analysis of highly-detailed 
electronic medical record (EMR) data would demonstrate that patients vary widely 
in their glycaemic response to critical illness and response to insulin therapy. 
Due to this variability, we believed that hyper- and hypoglycaemia would remain 
common in ICU care despite standardised approaches to management. We utilized 
the Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care III v1.4 (MIMIC) database. We 
identified 19,694 admissions between 2008 and 2012 with available glucose 
results and insulin administration data. We demonstrate that hyper- and 
hypoglycaemia are common at the time of admission and remain so 1 week into an 
ICU admission. Insulin treatment strategies vary significantly, irrespective of 
blood glucose level or diabetic status. We reveal a tremendous opportunity for 
EMR data to guide tailored management. Through this work, we have made available 
a highly-detailed data source for future investigation.

OBJECTIVE: To explore the values of neutrophil to lymphocyte ratio (NLR), 
platelet to lymphocyte ratio (PLR), neutrophil to albumin ratio (NAR), 
prognostic nutritional index (PNI), systemic immune inflammatory index (SII) and 
red cell distribution width to albumin ratio (RA) for evaluating the risk of 
30-day mortality of ischemic stroke or hemorrhagic stroke patients.
METHODS: In this cohort study, the data of 1,601 patients diagnosed with stroke 
were extracted from the Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care III 
(MIMIC-III) database. Among them, 908 were hemorrhagic stroke patients and 693 
were ischemic stroke patients. Demographic and clinical variables of patients 
were collected. Univariate and multivariable Cox regression were performed to 
evaluate the predictive values of NLR, PLR, SII, NAR, RA, and PNI for 30-day 
mortality in hemorrhagic stroke or ischemic stroke patients. The receiver 
operator characteristic (ROC) curves were plotted to assess the predictive 
values of NLR, NAR, and RA for 30-day mortality of hemorrhagic stroke patients.
RESULTS: At the end of follow-up, 226 hemorrhagic stroke patients and 216 
ischemic stroke patients died. The elevated NLR level was associated with 
increased risk of 30-day mortality in hemorrhagic stroke [hazard ratio (HR) = 
1.17, 95% confidence interval (CI): 1.06-1.29]. The increased NAR level was 
associated with elevated risk of 30-day mortality in hemorrhagic stroke (HR = 
1.16, 95% CI: 1.02-1.30). The high RA level was linked with increased risk of 
30-day mortality (HR = 1.44, 95% CI: 1.23-1.69). No significant correlation was 
observed in these inflammation biomarkers with the risk of 30-day mortality in 
ischemic stroke patients. The area under the curves (AUCs) of NLR, RA, and NAR 
for evaluating the risk of 30-day mortality of hemorrhagic stroke patients were 
0.552 (95% CI: 0.503-0.601), 0.644 (95% CI: 0.590-0.699) and 0.541 (95% CI: 
0.490-0.592).
CONCLUSION: NLR, NAR, and RA were potential prognostic biomarkers for predicting 
30-day mortality of hemorrhagic stroke patients, which might provide clinicians 
an easy and cheap way to quickly identify patients with high risk of mortality.

Acute myocardial infarction (AMI) and sepsis are the leading causes of high 
mortality rates in intensive care units. While sepsis frequently affects the 
cardiovascular system, distinguishing between sepsis-induced cardiomyopathy and 
AMI remains challenging due to overlapping biomarkers. Misdiagnosis can hinder 
timely treatment and increase risk of complications. This study used 
multidimensional clinical data and machine learning techniques to develop and 
validate a novel predictive model for identifying AMI in critically ill patients 
with sepsis. Data from patients with sepsis were extracted from the Medical 
Information Mart for Intensive Care-IV database. Six machine learning algorithms 
were employed for model construction. Additionally, the machine learning-based 
models were compared with traditional scoring systems. Model performance was 
evaluated in terms of discrimination, calibration, and clinical applicability. 
In total, 2,103 critically ill patients with sepsis were included, 459 (21.8%) 
of whom experienced AMI during hospitalization. A total of 26 variables were 
selected for model construction. Among all models, the Gradient Boosting 
Classifier model demonstrated the best predictive performance in terms of 
discrimination, calibration, and clinical applicability. Machine learning models 
have the potential to serve as tools for predicting AMI in patients with sepsis. 
The Gradient Boosting Classifier model developed herein demonstrated promising 
predictive performance, supporting clinicians in identifying patients at 
high-risk of sepsis and implementing early interventions to reduce mortality 
rates.

BACKGROUND: Sepsis presents a significant healthcare challenge, characterized by 
high morbidity and mortality rates. There is a scarcity of relevant studies 
investigating the association between serum lactate dehydrogenase level and the 
prognosis of sepsis in patients from intensive care unit, with smaller sample 
sizes compared to other studies.
METHODS: A retrospective analysis was conducted utilizing data from the Second 
Affiliated Hospital of Guangzhou Medical University and the Medical Information 
Mart for Intensive Care IV (MIMIC-IV). The primary outcome was the in-hospital 
mortality. Multivariate Cox proportional hazards regression was adopted to 
assess the independent association. Receiver operator characteristic (ROC) curve 
was used to evaluate the predictive value.
RESULTS: We included a total of 2148 patients in the Guangzhou Sepsis Cohort 
(GZSC) database and 5830 patients in the MIMIC-IV database. In multivariate Cox 
proportional hazards regression, high levels of LDH are significantly associated 
with higher mortality (HR = 1.21, 95% CI 1.13-1.30, p < 0.001 in the GZSC 
database and HR = 1.19, 95% CI 1.13-1.25, p < 0.001 in the MIMIC-IV database). 
The ROC curves showed that the AUC of LDH was 0.663 in the GZSC database and 
0.660 in the MIMIC-IV database.
CONCLUSIONS: A lower lactate dehydrogenase level is associated with reduced 
in-hospital mortality among patients with sepsis, suggesting its potential as a 
valuable marker for predicting prognosis in this patient population.

BACKGROUND: The burden of atrial fibrillation (AF) in the intensive care unit 
(ICU) remains heavy. Glycaemic control is important in the AF management. 
Glycaemic variability (GV), an emerging marker of glycaemic control, is 
associated with unfavourable prognosis, and abnormal GV is prevalent in ICUs. 
However, the impact of GV on the prognosis of AF patients in the ICU remains 
uncertain. This study aimed to evaluate the relationship between GV and 
all-cause mortality after ICU admission at short-, medium-, and long-term 
intervals in AF patients.
METHODS: Data was obtained from the Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care 
IV 3.0 database, with admissions (2008-2019) as primary analysis cohort and 
admissions (2020-2022) as external validation cohort. Multivariate Cox 
proportional hazards models, and restricted cubic spline analyses were used to 
assess the associations between GV and mortality outcomes. Subsequently, GV and 
other clinical features were used to construct machine learning (ML) prediction 
models for 30-day all-cause mortality after ICU admission.
RESULTS: The primary analysis cohort included 8989 AF patients (age 76.5 
[67.7-84.3] years; 57.8% male), while the external validation cohort included 
837 AF patients (age 72.9 [65.3-80.2] years; 67.4% male). Multivariate Cox 
proportional hazards models revealed that higher GV quartiles were associated 
with higher risk of 30-day (Q3: HR 1.19, 95%CI 1.04-1.37; Q4: HR 1.33, 95%CI 
1.16-1.52), 90-day (Q3: HR 1.25, 95%CI 1.11-1.40; Q4: HR 1.34, 95%CI 1.29-1.50), 
and 360-day (Q3: HR 1.21, 95%CI 1.09-1.33; Q4: HR 1.33, 95%CI 1.20-1.47) 
all-cause mortality, compared with lowest GV quartile. Moreover, our data 
suggests that GV needs to be contained within 20.0%. Among all ML models, light 
gradient boosting machine had the best performance (internal validation: AUC 
[0.780], G-mean [0.551], F1-score [0.533]; external validation: AUC [0.788], 
G-mean [0.578], F1-score [0.568]).
CONCLUSION: GV is a significant predictor of ICU short-term, mid-term, and 
long-term all-cause mortality in patients with AF (the potential risk 
stratification threshold is 20.0%). ML models incorporating GV demonstrated high 
efficiency in predicting short-term mortality and GV was ranked anterior in 
importance. These findings underscore the potential of GV as a valuable 
biomarker in guiding clinical decisions and improving patient outcomes in this 
high-risk population.

OBJECTIVE: To develop machine learning models for predicting intensive care unit 
(ICU) readmission using ensemble learning algorithms.
METHODS: A publicly accessible American ICU database, medical information mart 
for intensive care (MIMIC)-Ⅲ as the data source was used, and the patients were 
selected by the inclusion and exclusion criteria. A set of variables that had 
the predictive ability of outcome including demographics, vital signs, 
laboratory tests, and comorbidities of patients were extracted from the dataset. 
We built the ICU readmission prediction models based on ensemble learning 
methods including random forest, adaptive boosting (AdaBoost), and gradient 
boosting decision tree (GBDT), and compared the prediction performance of the 
machine learning models with a conventional Logistic regression model. Five-fold 
cross validation was used to train and validate the prediction models. Average 
sensitivity, positive prediction value, negative prediction value, false 
positive rate, false negative rate, area under the receiver operating 
characteristic curve (AUROC) and Brier score were used as performance measures. 
After constructing the prediction models, top 10 predictive variables based on 
importance ranking were identified by the model with the best discrimination.
RESULTS: Among these ICU readmission prediction models, GBDT (AUROC=0.858) had 
better performance than random forest (AUROC=0.827), and was slightly superior 
to AdaBoost (AUROC=0.851) in terms of AUROC. Compared with Logistic regression 
(AUROC=0.810), the discrimination of the three ensemble learning models was much 
better. The feature importance provided by GBDT showed that the top ranking 
variables included vital signs and laboratory tests. The patients with ICU 
readmission had higher mean arterial pressure, systolic blood pressure, 
diastolic blood pressure, and heart rate than the patients without ICU 
readmission. Meanwhile, the patients readmitted to ICU experienced lower urine 
output and higher serum creatinine. Overall, the patients having repeated 
admissions during their hospitalization showed worse heart function and renal 
function compared with the patients without ICU readmission.
CONCLUSION: The ensemble learning based ICU readmission prediction models had 
better performance than Logistic regression model. Such ensemble learning models 
have the potential to aid ICU physicians in identifying those patients with high 
risk of ICU readmission and thus help improve overall clinical outcomes.

目的: 基于集成学习算法建立患者再入重症监护病房(intensive care unit, ICU)的风险预测模型，并比较各个模型的预测性能。
方法: 使用美国重症医学数据库(medical information mart for intensive 
care，MIMIC)-Ⅲ，根据纳入、排除标准筛选患者，提取人口学特征、生命体征、实验室检查、合并症等可能对结局有预测作用的变量，基于集成学习方法随机森林、自适应提升算法(adaptive 
boosting, AdaBoost)和梯度提升决策树(gradient boosting decision tree, 
GBDT)建立再入ICU预测模型，并比较集成学习与Logistic回归的预测性能。使用五折交叉验证后的平均灵敏度、阳性预测值、阴性预测值、假阳性率、假阴性率、受试者工作特征曲线下面积(area 
under the receiver operating characteristic 
curve，AUROC)和Brier评分评价模型效果，基于最佳性能模型给出重要性排序前10位的预测变量。
结果: 所有模型中，GBDT (AUROC=0.858)优于随机森林(AUROC=0.827)，略好于AdaBoost 
(AUROC=0.851)。与Logistic回归(AUROC=0.810)相比，集成学习算法在区分度上均有较大的提升。GBDT算法给出的变量重要性排序中，平均动脉压、收缩压、舒张压、心率、尿量、血肌酐等变量排序靠前，相对而言，再入ICU患者的心血管功能和肾功能更差。
结论: 
基于集成学习算法的患者再入ICU预测模型表现出较好的性能，优于Logistic回归。使用集成学习算法建立的再入ICU风险预测模型可用于识别再入ICU风险高的患者，医务人员可针对高风险患者采取干预措施，改善患者的整体临床结局。

BACKGROUND: Patient monitoring is vital in all stages of care. In particular, 
intensive care unit (ICU) patient monitoring has the potential to reduce 
complications and morbidity, and to increase the quality of care by enabling 
hospitals to deliver higher-quality, cost-effective patient care, and improve 
the quality of medical services in the ICU.
OBJECTIVE: We here report the development and validation of ICU length of stay 
and mortality prediction models. The models will be used in an intelligent ICU 
patient monitoring module of an Intelligent Remote Patient Monitoring (IRPM) 
framework that monitors the health status of patients, and generates timely 
alerts, maneuver guidance, or reports when adverse medical conditions are 
predicted.
METHODS: We utilized the publicly available Medical Information Mart for 
Intensive Care (MIMIC) database to extract ICU stay data for adult patients to 
build two prediction models: one for mortality prediction and another for ICU 
length of stay. For the mortality model, we applied six commonly used machine 
learning (ML) binary classification algorithms for predicting the discharge 
status (survived or not). For the length of stay model, we applied the same six 
ML algorithms for binary classification using the median patient population ICU 
stay of 2.64 days. For the regression-based classification, we used two ML 
algorithms for predicting the number of days. We built two variations of each 
prediction model: one using 12 baseline demographic and vital sign features, and 
the other based on our proposed quantiles approach, in which we use 21 extra 
features engineered from the baseline vital sign features, including their 
modified means, standard deviations, and quantile percentages.
RESULTS: We could perform predictive modeling with minimal features while 
maintaining reasonable performance using the quantiles approach. The best 
accuracy achieved in the mortality model was approximately 89% using the random 
forest algorithm. The highest accuracy achieved in the length of stay model, 
based on the population median ICU stay (2.64 days), was approximately 65% using 
the random forest algorithm.
CONCLUSIONS: The novelty in our approach is that we built models to predict ICU 
length of stay and mortality with reasonable accuracy based on a combination of 
ML and the quantiles approach that utilizes only vital signs available from the 
patient's profile without the need to use any external features. This approach 
is based on feature engineering of the vital signs by including their modified 
means, standard deviations, and quantile percentages of the original features, 
which provided a richer dataset to achieve better predictive power in our 
models.

BACKGROUND: The association between red blood cell distribution width (RDW) to 
albumin ratio (RAR) and prognosis in patients with acute respiratory failure 
(ARF) admitted to the Intensive Care Unit (ICU) remains unclear. This 
retrospective cohort study aims to investigate this association.
METHODS: Clinical information of ARF patients was collected from the Medical 
Information Mart for Intensive Care IV (MIMIC-IV) version 2.0 database. The 
primary outcome was, in-hospital mortality and secondary outcomes included 
28-day mortality, 60-day mortality, length of hospital stay, and length of ICU 
stay. Cox regression models and subgroup analyses were conducted to explore the 
relationship between RAR and mortality.
RESULTS: A total of 4547 patients with acute respiratory failure were enrolled, 
with 2277 in the low ratio group (RAR < 4.83) and 2270 in the high ratio group 
(RAR > = 4.83). Kaplan-Meier survival analysis demonstrated a significant 
difference in survival probability between the two groups. After adjusting for 
confounding factors, the Cox regression analysis showed that the high RAR ratio 
had a higher hazard ratio (HR) for in-hospital mortality (HR 1.22, 95% CI 
1.07-1.40; P = 0.003), as well as for 28-day mortality and 60-day mortality. 
Propensity score-matched (PSM) analysis further supported the finding that high 
RAR was an independent risk factor for ARF.
CONCLUSION: This study reveals that RAR is an independent risk factor for poor 
clinical prognosis in patients with ARF admitted to the ICU. Higher RAR levels 
were associated with increased in-hospital, 28-day and 60-day mortality rates.

BACKGROUND: Serum lactate dehydrogenase to albumin ratio (LAR) is associated 
with poor outcomes in malignancy and pneumonia. However, there are few studies 
suggesting that LAR is associated with the occurrence of acute kidney injury 
(AKI) in patients with sepsis, which was investigated in this study.
METHODS: We conducted a retrospective cohort study based on the Medical 
Information Mart for Intensive Care (MIMIC)-IV database. The primary outcome was 
the occurrence of AKI within 2 days and 7 days. Multivariable logistic 
regression models were used to calculate odds ratios to validate the association 
between LAR and AKI, in-hospital mortality, RRT use, and recovery of renal 
function, respectively.
RESULTS: A total of 4010 participants were included in this study. The median 
age of the participants was 63.5 years and the median LAR was 10.5. After 
adjusting for confounding variables, patients in the highest LAR quartile had a 
higher risk of AKI than those in the lowest LAR quartile within 2 days and 
7 days, with odds ratios of 1.37 (95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.23-1.52) and 
1.95 (95% CI: 1.72-2.22), respectively. The adjusted odds of AKI within 2 and 
7 days were 1.16 (95% CI: 1.12-1.20) and 1.29 (95% CI: 1.24-1.35) for each 
1 unit increase in LAR(log2), respectively.
CONCLUSION: This study demonstrated that elevated LAR was associated with poor 
prognosis in patients with sepsis. The risk of AKI and in-hospital mortality 
increased, the need for RRT increased, and the chance of recovery of renal 
function decreased with the increase of LAR.

Early warning prediction of traumatic hemorrhagic shock (THS) can greatly reduce 
patient mortality and morbidity. We aimed to develop and validate models with 
different stepped feature sets to predict THS in advance. From the PLA General 
Hospital Emergency Rescue Database and Medical Information Mart for Intensive 
Care III, we identified 604 and 1,614 patients, respectively. Two popular 
machine learning algorithms (i.e., extreme gradient boosting [XGBoost] and 
logistic regression) were applied. The area under the receiver operating 
characteristic curve (AUROC) was used to evaluate the performance of the models. 
By analyzing the feature importance based on XGBoost, we found that features in 
vital signs (VS), routine blood (RB), and blood gas analysis (BG) were the most 
relevant to THS (0.292, 0.249, and 0.225, respectively). Thus, the stepped 
relationships existing in them were revealed. Furthermore, the three stepped 
feature sets (i.e., VS, VS + RB, and VS + RB + sBG) were passed to the two 
machine learning algorithms to predict THS in the subsequent T hours (where 
T = 3, 2, 1, or 0.5), respectively. Results showed that the XGBoost model 
performance was significantly better than the logistic regression. The model 
using vital signs alone achieved good performance at the half-hour time window 
(AUROC = 0.935), and the performance was increased when laboratory results were 
added, especially when the time window was 1 h (AUROC = 0.950 and 0.968, 
respectively). These good-performing interpretable models demonstrated 
acceptable generalization ability in external validation, which could flexibly 
and rollingly predict THS T hours (where T = 0.5, 1) prior to clinical 
recognition. A prospective study is necessary to determine the clinical utility 
of the proposed THS prediction models.

BACKGROUND: In-hospital mortality, prolonged length of stay (LOS), and 30-day 
readmission are common outcomes in the intensive care unit (ICU). Traditional 
scoring systems and machine learning models for predicting these outcomes 
usually ignore the characteristics of ICU data, which are time-series forms. We 
aimed to use time-series deep learning models with the selective combination of 
three widely used scoring systems to predict these outcomes.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: A retrospective cohort study was conducted on 40,083 
patients in ICU from the Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care-IV 
(MIMIC-IV) database. Three deep learning models, namely, recurrent neural 
network (RNN), gated recurrent unit (GRU), and long short-term memory (LSTM) 
with attention mechanisms, were trained for the prediction of in-hospital 
mortality, prolonged LOS, and 30-day readmission with variables collected during 
the initial 24 h after ICU admission or the last 24 h before discharge. The 
inclusion of variables was based on three widely used scoring systems, namely, 
APACHE II, SOFA, and SAPS II, and the predictors consisted of time-series vital 
signs, laboratory tests, medication, and procedures. The patients were randomly 
divided into a training set (80%) and a test set (20%), which were used for 
model development and model evaluation, respectively. The area under the 
receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC), sensitivity, specificity, and 
Brier scores were used to evaluate model performance. Variable significance was 
identified through attention mechanisms.
RESULTS: A total of 33 variables for 40,083 patients were enrolled for mortality 
and prolonged LOS prediction and 36,180 for readmission prediction. The rates of 
occurrence of the three outcomes were 9.74%, 27.54%, and 11.79%, respectively. 
In each of the three outcomes, the performance of RNN, GRU, and LSTM did not 
differ greatly. Mortality prediction models, prolonged LOS prediction models, 
and readmission prediction models achieved AUCs of 0.870 ± 0.001, 0.765 ± 0.003, 
and 0.635 ± 0.018, respectively. The top significant variables co-selected by 
the three deep learning models were Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS), age, blood urea 
nitrogen, and norepinephrine for mortality; GCS, invasive ventilation, and blood 
urea nitrogen for prolonged LOS; and blood urea nitrogen, GCS, and ethnicity for 
readmission.
CONCLUSION: The prognostic prediction models established in our study achieved 
good performance in predicting common outcomes of patients in ICU, especially in 
mortality prediction. In addition, GCS and blood urea nitrogen were identified 
as the most important factors strongly associated with adverse ICU events.

The objective of this study was to investigate whether serum anion gap (AG), 
which may serve as an indicator for multiple organic dysfunctions in the 
condition of hypoxia, could be utilized as a reliable prognostic marker for 
short-term mortality and a potential therapeutic target in patients with acute 
respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). A retrospective cohort study was conducted 
using data from the Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care (MIMIC-IV) 
electronic database (version 2.2), including 11,227 confirmed patients with 
ARDS. Multivariate Cox proportional hazards analysis revealed a significant 
association between elevated AG levels and all-cause mortality. After adjusting 
for confounding factors, elevated AG levels were strongly correlated with 90-day 
mortality [adjusted hazard ratio (HR) 1.23; 95% confidence interval (CI) 
1.10-1.37; P < 0.001]. Restricted cubic splines and Kaplan-Meier curves 
demonstrated an increased risk of all-cause mortality with higher AG levels. 
Subgroup analysis results emphasized the significance of furosemide as a pivotal 
therapeutic option, which was further supported by subsequent Kaplan-Meier 
curves and Cox proportional hazards analysis showing its protective effects in 
patients with elevated serum AG levels. Even after adjusting for relevant 
confounding factors, furosemide continued to exhibit a significant protective 
effect in the group with the highest AG level (Q4: adjusted HR 0.57; 95% CI 
0.50-0.65; P < 0.001); however, no significant protective effect was observed in 
the intermediate level groups (Q2 and Q3). In summary, this research 
demonstrated a significant association between heightened serum AG levels and 
increased mortality risk among ARDS patients, which was mitigated by 
administration of furosemide.

OBJECTIVE: As data science and artificial intelligence continue to rapidly gain 
traction, the publication of freely available ICU datasets has become invaluable 
to propel data-driven clinical research. In this guide for clinicians and 
researchers, we aim to: 1) systematically search and identify all publicly 
available adult clinical ICU datasets, 2) compare their characteristics, data 
quality, and richness and critically appraise their strengths and weaknesses, 
and 3) provide researchers with suggestions, which datasets are appropriate for 
answering their clinical question.
DATA SOURCES: A systematic search was performed in Pubmed, ArXiv, MedRxiv, and 
BioRxiv.
STUDY SELECTION: We selected all studies that reported on publicly available 
adult patient-level intensive care datasets.
DATA EXTRACTION: A total of four publicly available, adult, critical care, 
patient-level databases were included (Amsterdam University Medical Center data 
base [AmsterdamUMCdb], eICU Collaborative Research Database eICU CRD], High 
time-resolution intensive care unit dataset [HiRID], and Medical Information 
Mart for Intensive Care-IV). Databases were compared using a priori defined 
categories, including demographics, patient characteristics, and data richness. 
The study protocol and search strategy were prospectively registered.
DATA SYNTHESIS: Four ICU databases fulfilled all criteria for inclusion and were 
queried using SQL (PostgreSQL version 12; PostgreSQL Global Development Group) 
and analyzed using R (R Foundation for Statistical Computing, Vienna, Austria). 
The number of unique patient admissions varied between 23,106 (AmsterdamUMCdb) 
and 200,859 (eICU-CRD). Frequency of laboratory values and vital signs was 
highest in HiRID, for example, 5.2 (±3.4) lactate values per day and 29.7 
(±10.2) systolic blood pressure values per hour. Treatment intensity varied with 
vasopressor and ventilatory support in 69.0% and 83.0% of patients in 
AmsterdamUMCdb versus 12.0% and 21.0% in eICU-CRD, respectively. ICU mortality 
ranged from 5.5% in eICU-CRD to 9.9% in AmsterdamUMCdb.
CONCLUSIONS: We identified four publicly available adult clinical ICU datasets. 
Sample size, severity of illness, treatment intensity, and frequency of reported 
parameters differ markedly between the databases. This should guide clinicians 
and researchers which databases to best answer their clinical questions.

BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: Interpretable and real-time prediction of sepsis and 
risk factor analysis could enable timely treatment by clinicians and improve 
patient outcomes. To develop an interpretable machine-learning model for the 
prediction and risk factor analysis of sepsis and septic death.
METHODS: This is a retrospective observational cohort study based on the Medical 
Information Mart for Intensive Care (MIMIC-IV) dataset; 69,619 patients from the 
database were screened. The two outcomes include patients diagnosed with sepsis 
and the death of septic patients. Clinical variables from ICU admission to 
outcomes were analyzed: demographic data, vital signs, Glasgow Coma Scale 
scores, laboratory test results, and results for arterial blood gasses (ABGs). 
Model performance was compared using the area under the receiver operating 
characteristic curve (AUROC). Model interpretations were based on the Shapley 
additive explanations (SHAP), and the clustered analysis was based on the 
combination of K-means and dimensionality reduction algorithms of t-SNE and PCA.
RESULTS: For the analysis of sepsis and septic death, 47,185 and 2480 patients 
were enrolled, respectively. The XGBoost model achieved a predictive value of 
area under the curve (AUC): 0.745 [0.731-0.759] for sepsis prediction and 0.8 
[0.77, 0.828] for septic death prediction. The real-time prediction model was 
trained to predict by day and visualize the individual or combined risk factor 
effects on the outcomes based on SHAP values. Clustered analysis separated the 
two phenotypes with distinct risk factors among patients with septic death.
CONCLUSION: The proposed real-time, clustered prediction model for sepsis and 
septic death exhibited superior performance in predicting the outcomes and 
visualizing the risk factors in a real-time and interpretable manner to 
distinguish and mitigate patient risks, thus promising immense potential in 
effective clinical decision making and comprehensive understanding of complex 
diseases such as sepsis.

BACKGROUND: Conventional systemic inflammatory biomarkers could predict 
prognosis in patients with ischemic stroke (IS) admitted to the intensive care 
unit (ICU). Acute kidney injury (AKI) is common in patients with IS admitted to 
ICU, but few studies have used systemic inflammatory biomarkers to predict AKI 
in critically ill patients with IS. This study aimed to establish a risk model 
based on white blood cell (WBC)-related biomarkers to predict AKI in critically 
ill patients with IS.
METHODS: Data were extracted from the Medical Information Mart for Intensive 
Care-IV (MIMIC-IV) for a training cohort, and data were extracted from the 
Medical Information Mart for eICU Collaborative Research Database (eICU-CRD) for 
a validation cohort. Logistic regression analysis was used to determine the 
significant predictors of WBC-related biomarkers on AKI prediction, and a risk 
model was established based on those significant indicators in multivariate 
logistic regression. The receiver operating characteristics (ROC) curve was 
utilized to obtain the best cut-off value of the risk model. The Kaplan-Meier 
curve was used to evaluate the prognosis-predictive ability of the risk model.
RESULTS: The overall incidence of AKI was 28.4% in the training cohort and 33.2% 
in the validation cohort. WBC to lymphocyte ratio (WLR), WBC to basophils ratio 
(WBR), WBC to hemoglobin ratio (WHR), and neutrophil to lymphocyte ratio (NLR) 
could independently predict AKI, and a novel risk model was established based on 
WLR, WBR, WHR, and NLR. This risk model depicted good prediction performance 
both in AKI and other clinical outcomes including hemorrhage, persistent AKI, 
AKI progression, ICU mortality, and in-hospital mortality both in the training 
set and in the validation set.
CONCLUSION: A risk model based on WBC-related indicators exhibited good AKI 
prediction performance in critically ill patients with IS which could provide a 
risk stratification tool for clinicians in the ICU.

OBJECTIVES: There are many studies of acute kidney injury (AKI) diagnosis models 
lack of external validation and prospective validation. We constructed the 
models using three databases to predict severe AKI within 48 hours in intensive 
care unit (ICU) patients.
DESIGN: A retrospective and prospective cohort study.
SETTING: We studied critically ill patients in our database (SHZJU-ICU) and two 
other public databases, the Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care (MIMIC) 
and AmsterdamUMC databases, including basic demographics, vital signs and 
laboratory results. We predicted the diagnosis of severe AKI in patients in the 
next 48 hours using machine-learning algorithms with the three databases. Then, 
we carried out real-time severe AKI prediction in the prospective validation 
study at our centre for 1 year.
PARTICIPANTS: All patients included in three databases with uniform exclusion 
criteria.
PRIMARY AND SECONDARY OUTCOME MEASURES: Effect evaluation index of prediction 
models.
RESULTS: We included 58 492 patients, and a total of 5257 (9.0%) patients met 
the definition of severe AKI. In the internal validation of the SHZJU-ICU and 
MIMIC databases, the best area under the receiver operating characteristic curve 
(AUROC) of the model was 0.86. The external validation results by AmsterdamUMC 
database were also satisfactory, with the best AUROC of 0.86. A total of 2532 
patients were admitted to the centre for prospective validation; 358 positive 
results were predicted and 344 patients were diagnosed with severe AKI, with the 
best sensitivity of 0.72, the specificity of 0.80 and the AUROC of 0.84.
CONCLUSION: The prediction model of severe AKI exhibits promises as a clinical 
application based on dynamic vital signs and laboratory results of multicentre 
databases with prospective and external validation.

BACKGROUNDS: Decreased urine output (UO) is associated with adverse outcomes in 
certain patients, but this effect in patients admitted for cardiovascular 
diseases is still unproven. Moreover, the relationship between increased UO and 
prognosis is also unclear.
OBJECTIVE: To investigate the relationship between decreased or increased UO and 
outcomes in patients with the cardiovascular intensive care unit (CICU).
METHODS: This study was a retrospective cohort analysis based on the medical 
information mart for intensive care III (MIMIC-III) database. The patients' data 
were extracted from the Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center (Boston, MA) 
between 2001 and 2012. With the initial 24-h UO range from 0.5 to 1.0 ml/kg/h as 
the reference, participants were divided into the several groups. The primary 
outcome was 30-day mortality. The secondary outcomes were 90-day mortality, ICU 
mortality, hospital mortality, use of mechanical ventilation (MV), and 
vasopressor agents in the first 24-h of ICU. The association between UO and 
mortality was assessed by multivariable logistic regression.
RESULTS: A total of 13,279 patients admitted to CICU were included. Low UO (< 
0.5 ml/kg/h) was strongly associated with 30-day mortality (unadjusted OR = 
3.993, 95% CI: 3.447-4.625, p < 0.001), and very high UO (≥ 2.0 ml/kg/h) was 
also a significantly risk factor for 30-day mortality (Unadjusted OR = 2.069, 
95% CI: 1.701-2.516, p < 0.001) compared with the reference. The same effects 
also were shown in the multivariable logistic regression, adjusted by age, 
gender, vital signs, common comorbidities, and use of diuretics, with an 
adjusted OR of 2.023 (95% CI: 1.693-2.417, p < 0.001) for low UO and 1.771 (95% 
CI: 1.389-2.256, p < 0.001) for very high UO. Moreover, both decreased UO and 
increased UO were risk factors for 90-day mortality, ICU mortality, hospital 
mortality, use of MV and vasopressor agents.
CONCLUSION: The decreased and increased UO both were significantly associated 
with short-term mortality, the relationship between UO and mortality was U-shape 
rather than linear.

BACKGROUND: Even brief hypotension is associated with increased morbidity and 
mortality. We developed a machine learning model to predict the initial 
hypotension event among intensive care unit (ICU) patients and designed an alert 
system for bedside implementation.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: From the Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care III 
(MIMIC-3) dataset, minute-by-minute vital signs were extracted. A hypotension 
event was defined as at least five measurements within a 10-min period of 
systolic blood pressure ≤ 90 mmHg and mean arterial pressure ≤ 60 mmHg. Using 
time series data from 30-min overlapping time windows, a random forest (RF) 
classifier was used to predict risk of hypotension every minute. 
Chronologically, the first half of extracted data was used to train the model, 
and the second half was used to validate the trained model. The model's 
performance was measured with area under the receiver operating characteristic 
curve (AUROC) and area under the precision recall curve (AUPRC). Hypotension 
alerts were generated using risk score time series, a stacked RF model. A 
lockout time were applied for real-life implementation.
RESULTS: We identified 1307 subjects (1580 ICU stays) as the hypotension group 
and 1619 subjects (2279 ICU stays) as the non-hypotension group. The RF model 
showed AUROC of 0.93 and 0.88 at 15 and 60 min, respectively, before 
hypotension, and AUPRC of 0.77 at 60 min before. Risk score trajectories 
revealed 80% and > 60% of hypotension predicted at 15 and 60 min before the 
hypotension, respectively. The stacked model with 15-min lockout produced on 
average 0.79 alerts/subject/hour (sensitivity 92.4%).
CONCLUSION: Clinically significant hypotension events in the ICU can be 
predicted at least 1 h before the initial hypotension episode. With a highly 
sensitive and reliable practical alert system, a vast majority of future 
hypotension could be captured, suggesting potential real-life utility.

BACKGROUND: The aim of this study was to investigate the prognostic role of 
platelet to albumin ratio (PAR) and in persistent acute kidney injury (pAKI) of 
patients admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU).
METHODS: We involved pAKI patients from the Medical Information Mart for 
Intensive Care-IV (MIMIC-IV) database and eICU Collaborative Research Database 
(eICU-CRD). Receiver operating curve (ROC) analysis was performed to evaluate 
the optimal cut-off PAR.
RESULTS: A total of 7,646 patients were finally included in the present study. 
The optimal cut-off value of PAR was 7.2. The high-PAR group was associated with 
pAKI (hazard ratio [HR]: 3.25, 95% CI: 2.85-3.72, P < 0.001). We also performed 
this in the validation cohort, the results further confirmed that the high-PAR 
group was associated with pAKI (HR: 2.24, 95% CI: 1.86-2.71, P < 0.001). The PAR 
exhibited good pAKI predictive abilities in the original cohort (C-index: 0.726, 
95%CI: 0.714-0.739) and in the validation cohort (C-index: 0.744, 
95%CI:0.722-0.766) Moreover, as a systemic inflammatory indicator, PAR depicted 
better predictive ability compared to other systemic inflammatory indicators.
CONCLUSION: The present study manifested that elevated PAR could predicts pAKI 
in patients admitted to ICU. PAR may be an easily obtained and useful biomarker 
to clinicians for the early identification of pAKI.

BACKGROUND: Congestive heart failure (HF) is a common condition in the intensive 
care unit (ICU). Cardiomyopathy is an important etiological factor in HF. 
However, few studies have explored the effect of cardiomyopathy on the prognosis 
of HF. This study explored the association between comorbid cardiomyopathy and 
the outcomes of critically ill patients with congestive HF.
METHODS: A retrospective cohort study was performed using data extracted from 
Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care IV (MIMIC-IV) database. All adult 
patients with the first ICU admission were enrolled as participants but those 
diagnosed with cardiomyopathy alone were excluded. The demographics, 
comorbidities, vital signs, laboratory tests, scoring systems, and treatments of 
patients were extracted to further analyze. The composite endpoints included 
in-hospital mortality, cardiac arrest, and re-admission to the ICU. The 
association between cardiomyopathy comorbidity and the composite endpoints was 
assessed using propensity-score matching (PSM) and multivariable logistic 
regression models.
RESULTS: A total of 27,901 critically ill patients were enrolled, including 
1,023 patients diagnosed with cardiomyopathy and congestive HF. The average age 
of the cohort was 64.37±17.36 years, and 58.13% of the patients were men. The 
ethnicity of patients was mainly white (64.67%). Multivariable logistic 
regression analyses found the risk of composite endpoints in patients with 
cardiomyopathy was higher than other groups [odds ratio (OR) =1.87; 95% 
confidence interval (CI): 1.62-2.15; P<0.001]. Compared to patients with 
congestive HF alone (OR =1.43; 95% CI: 1.26-1.62; P<0.001), patients with 
cardiomyopathy had a similar risk of in-hospital death (OR =1.35; 95% CI: 
1.06-1.71; P=0.014). Moreover, the risks of cardiac arrest (OR =1.53; 95% CI: 
1.01-2.34; P=0.029) and re-admission to the ICU (OR =1.74; 95% CI: 1.39-2.17; 
P<0.001) were both higher in patients with cardiomyopathy than other groups. 
After PSM, the risk of composite endpoints was still higher in patients with 
cardiomyopathy (OR =1.64; 95% CI: 1.33-2.02; P<0.001). The association was 
consistent among patients admitted to the coronary care unit (CCU) and medical 
ICU (MICU)/surgical ICU (SICU).
CONCLUSIONS: Comorbid cardiomyopathy increased the risk of composite endpoints 
in patients with congestive HF admitted to the ICU. Cardiomyopathy is related to 
the poor outcomes of critically ill patients with congestive HF.

OBJECTIVE: To predict the 28-day mortality of critically ill, elderly patients 
with colorectal cancer (CRC) using five machine learning approaches.
METHODS: Data were extracted from the eICU Collaborative Research Database 
(eICU-CRD) (version 2.0) for a training cohort and from the Medical Information 
Mart for Intensive Care-IV (MIMIC-IV) and Wuhan Union hospital for validation 
cohorts. Clinical information (i.e., demographics; initial laboratory tests; 
vital signs; outcomes) were collected. Five machine learning algorithms 
(LightGBM, decision tree, XGBoost, random forest, and ensemble model) and a 
logistic regression were applied for the prediction of 28-day mortality.
RESULTS: Overall, 693 patients were included from the eICU cohort, 181 patients 
from the MIMIC-IV cohort and 95 from the Wuhan Union cohort. Among the six 
machine learning models, the ensemble model exhibited the best predictive 
ability (AUC, 0.86), followed by random forest (AUC, 0.83) and LightGBM (AUC, 
0.82) in the training cohort. The models also obtained the good predictive 
performance for the 28-day mortality in the validation cohorts.
CONCLUSIONS: We showed that machine learning algorithms can be used for the 
28-day mortality prediction in critically ill, elderly patients with CRC.

BACKGROUND: Intensive care unit (ICU) resources are inadequate for the large 
population in China, so it is essential for physicians to evaluate the condition 
of patients at admission. In this study, our objective was to construct a 
machine-learning risk prediction model for mortality in respiratory intensive 
care units (RICUs).
METHODS: This study involved 817 patients who made 1,063 visits and who were 
admitted to the RICU from 2012 to 2017. Potential predictors such as demographic 
information, laboratory results, vital signs and clinical characteristics were 
considered. We constructed eXtreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost) models and 
compared performances with random forest models, logistic regression models and 
clinical scores such as Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation II 
(APACHE II) and the sequential organ failure assessment (SOFA) system. The model 
was externally validated using data from Medical Information Mart for Intensive 
Care (MIMIC-III) database. A web-based calculator was developed for practical 
use.
RESULTS: Among the 1,063 visits, the RICU mortality rate was 13.5%. The XGBoost 
model achieved the best performance with the area under the receiver operating 
characteristics curve (AUROC) of 0.860 (95% confidence interval (CI): 0.808 - 
0.909) in the test set, which was significantly greater than APACHE II (0.749, 
95% CI: 0.674 - 0.820; P = 0.015) and SOFA (0.751, 95% CI: 0.669 - 0.818; P = 
0.018). The Hosmer-Lemeshow test indicated a good calibration of our predictive 
model in the test set with a P-value of 0.176. In the external validation 
dataset, the AUROC of XGBoost model was 0.779 (95% CI: 0.714 - 0.813). The final 
model contained variables that were previously known to be associated with 
mortality, but it also included some features absent from the clinical scores. 
The mean N-terminal pro-B-type natriuretic peptide (NTproBNP) of survivors was 
significantly lower than that of the non-survival group (2066.43 pg/mL vs. 
8232.81 pg/mL; P < 0.001).
CONCLUSIONS: Our results showed that the XGBoost model could be a suitable model 
for predicting RICU mortality with easy-to-collect variables at admission and 
help intensivists improve clinical decision-making for RICU patients. We found 
that higher NT-proBNP can be a good indicator of poor prognosis.

Objective/Introduction : Sequential vital-sign information and trends in vital 
signs are useful for predicting changes in patient state. This study aims to 
predict latent shock by observing sequential changes in patient vital signs. 
Methods : The dataset for this retrospective study contained a total of 93,194 
emergency department (ED) visits from January 1, 2016, and December 31, 2020, 
and Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care (MIMIC)-IV-ED data. We further 
divided the data into training and validation datasets by random sampling 
without replacement at a 7:3 ratio. We carried out external validation with 
MIMIC-IV-ED. Our prediction model included logistic regression (LR), random 
forest (RF) classifier, a multilayer perceptron (MLP), and a recurrent neural 
network (RNN). To analyze the model performance, we used area under the receiver 
operating characteristic curve (AUROC). Results : Data of 89,250 visits of 
patients who met prespecified criteria were used to develop a latent-shock 
prediction model. Data of 142,250 patient visits from MIMIC-IV-ED satisfying the 
same inclusion criteria were used for external validation of the prediction 
model. The AUROC values of prediction for latent shock were 0.822, 0.841, 0.852, 
and 0.830 with RNN, MLP, RF, and LR methods, respectively, at 3 h before latent 
shock. This is higher than the shock index or adjusted shock index. Conclusion : 
We developed a latent shock prediction model based on 24 h of vital-sign 
sequence that changed with time and predicted the results by individual.

BACKGROUND: Early prognosis evaluation is crucial for decision-making in 
cardiogenic shock (CS) patients. Dynamic lactate assessment, for example, 
normalized lactate load, has been a better prognosis predictor than single 
lactate value in septic shock. Our objective was to investigate the correlation 
between normalized lactate load and in-hospital mortality in patients with CS.
METHODS: Data were extracted from the Medical Information Mart for Intensive 
Care (MIMIC)-IV database. The calculation of lactate load involved the 
determination of the cumulative area under the lactate curve, while normalized 
lactate load was computed by dividing the lactate load by the corresponding 
period. Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) curves were constructed, and the 
evaluation of areas under the curves (AUC) for various parameters was performed 
using the DeLong test.
RESULTS: Our study involved a cohort of 1932 CS patients, with 687 individuals 
(36.1%) experiencing mortality during their hospitalization. The AUC for 
normalized lactate load demonstrated significant superiority compared to the 
first lactate (0.675 vs. 0.646, P < 0.001), maximum lactate (0.675 vs. 0.651, 
P < 0.001), and mean lactate (0.675 vs. 0.669, P = 0.003). Notably, the AUC for 
normalized lactate load showed comparability to that of the Sequential Organ 
Failure Assessment (SOFA) score (0.675 vs. 0.695, P = 0.175).
CONCLUSION: The normalized lactate load was an independently associated with the 
in-hospital mortality among CS patients.

BACKGROUND: There is no evidence to determine the association between the 
lactate dehydrogenase to albumin ratio (LAR) and the development of 
sepsis-associated acute kidney injury (SAKI). We aimed to investigate the 
predictive impact of LAR for SAKI in patients with sepsis.
METHODS: A total of 4,087 patients with sepsis from the Medical Information Mart 
for Intensive Care IV (MIMIC IV) database were included. Logistic regression 
analysis was used to identify the association between LAR and the risk of 
developing SAKI, and the relationship was visualized using restricted cubic 
spline (RCS). The clinical predictive value of LAR was evaluated by ROC curve 
analysis. Subgroup analysis was used to search for interactive factors.
RESULTS: The LAR level was markedly increased in the SAKI group (p < 0.001). 
There was a positive linear association between LAR and the risk of developing 
SAKI (p for nonlinearity = 0.867). Logistic regression analysis showed an 
independent predictive value of LAR for developing SAKI. The LAR had moderate 
clinical value, with an AUC of 0.644. Chronic kidney disease (CKD) was 
identified as an independent interactive factor. The predictive value of LAR for 
the development of SAKI disappeared in those with a history of CKD but remained 
in those without CKD.
CONCLUSIONS: Elevated LAR 12 h before and after the diagnosis of sepsis is an 
independent risk factor for the development of SAKI in patients with sepsis. 
Chronic comorbidities, especially the history of CKD, should be taken into 
account when using LAR to predict the development of AKI in patients with 
sepsis.

Chronic heart failure (CHF) poses a significant threat to human health. The 
stress hyperglycemia ratio (SHR) is a novel metric for accurately assessing 
stress hyperglycemia, which has been correlated with adverse outcomes in various 
major diseases. However, it remains unclear whether SHR is associated with 
28-day mortality in patients with pre-existing CHF who were admitted to 
intensive care units (ICUs). This study retrospectively recruited patients who 
were admitted to ICUs with both acute critical illness and pre-existing CHF from 
the Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care (MIMIC) database. 
Characteristics were compared between the survival and non-survival groups. The 
relationship between SHR and 28-day all-cause mortality was analyzed using 
restricted cubic splines, receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves, 
Kaplan-Meier survival analysis, and Cox proportional hazards regression 
analysis. The importance of the potential risk factors was assessed using the 
Boruta algorithm. Prediction models were constructed using machine learning 
algorithms. A total of 913 patients were enrolled. The risk of 28-day mortality 
increased with higher SHR levels (P < 0.001). SHR was independently associated 
with 28-day all-cause mortality, with an unadjusted hazard ratio (HR) of 1.45 
(P < 0.001) and an adjusted HR of 1.43 (P < 0.001). Subgroup analysis found that 
none of the potential risk factors, such as demographics, comorbidities, and 
drugs, affected the relationship (P for interaction > 0.05). The area under the 
ROC (AUC) curve for SHR was larger than those for admission blood glucose and 
HbA1c; the cut-off for SHR was 0.57. Patients with SHR higher than the cut-off 
had a significantly lower 28-day survival probability (P < 0.001). SHR was 
identified as one of the key factors for 28-day mortality by the Boruta 
algorithm. The predictive performance was verified through four machine learning 
algorithms, with the neural network algorithm being the best (AUC 0.801). For 
patients with both acute critical illness and pre-existing CHF, SHR was an 
independent predictor of 28-day all-cause mortality. Its prognostic performance 
surpasses those of HbA1c and blood glucose, and prognostic models based on SHR 
provide clinicians with an effective tool to make therapeutic decisions.

BACKGROUND: Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) complicated by atrial 
fibrillation (AF) in ICU patients is associated with higher risks of adverse 
outcomes. The red cell distribution width to albumin ratio (RAR), may predict 
mortality in critical illness, yet its link to 28-day mortality in ICU patients 
with COPD and AF remains unclear.
METHODS: This retrospective cohort study analyzed 693 ICU patients with COPD and 
AF from the Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care IV (MIMIC-IV) database, 
grouped by RAR tertiles. The primary endpoint was 28-day mortality, with 
secondary endpoints including 90-day, 365-day, and ICU mortality. Multivariate 
cox models estimated hazard ratios (HRs) for mortality, while restricted cubic 
spline regression assessed the linearity of the RAR-mortality relationship. 
Kaplan-Meier curves compared survival across tertiles, and subgroup analyses 
explored RAR's impact across age, gender, race, and comorbidities.
RESULTS: Our study included 693 ICU patients with both COPD and AF, with an 
average age of 74.9 years. The 28-day mortality was 30.7%. Patients in the 
highest RAR tertile had significantly worse 28-day survival (p < 0.0001). Higher 
RAR was linearly associated with increased 28-day mortality (p for 
non-linearity > 0.05), with each 1-unit increase in RAR linked to an 18% rise in 
mortality risk (95% CI: 1.08-1.29). Sensitivity analyses confirmed RAR's 
relevance for 90-day, 365-day, and ICU mortality.
CONCLUSIONS: RAR is independently associated with 28-day mortality in COPD 
patients with AF. Elevated RAR levels correlate with higher 28-day mortality 
rates in this population.

According to the WTO, there were 1.13 billion hypertension patients worldwide in 
2015. The WTO encouraged people to check the blood pressure regularly because a 
large amount of patients do not have any symptoms. However, traditional cuff 
measurement results are not enough to represent the patient's blood pressure 
status over a period of time. Therefore, there is an urgent need for portable, 
easy to operate, continuous measurement, and low-cost blood pressure measuring 
devices. In this paper, we adopted the convolutional neural network (CNN), based 
on the Hilbert-Huang Transform (HHT) method, to predict blood pressure (BP) risk 
level using photoplethysmography (PPG). Considering that the PPG's first and 
second derivative signals are related to atherosclerosis and vascular 
elasticity, we created a dataset called PPG+; the images of PPG+ carry 
information on PPG and its derivatives. We built three classification 
experiments by collecting 582 data records (the length of each record is 10 s) 
from the Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care (MIMIC) database: NT 
(normotension) vs. HT (hypertension), NT vs. PHT (prehypertension), and (NT + 
PHT) vs. HT; the F1 scores of the PPG + experiments using AlexNet were 98.90%, 
85.80%, and 93.54%, respectively. We found that, first, the dataset established 
by the HHT method performed well in the BP grade prediction experiment. Second, 
because the Hilbert spectra of the PPG are simple and periodic, AlexNet, which 
has only 8 layers, got better results. More layers instead increased the cost 
and difficulty of training.

BACKGROUND: Glucose metabolism and systemic inflammation have been associated 
with prognosis in acute pancreatitis (AP) patients. However, the possible value 
as a prognostic marker of the glucose-to-lymphocyte ratio (GLR) has not been 
evaluated in critically ill patients with AP.
METHODS: This study included 1,133 critically ill patients with AP from the 
Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care-IV (MIMIC-IV) database, who were 
randomly divided into the training cohort (n=806) and the validation cohort 
(n=327) at a ratio of 7:3. X-tile software was used to determine the optimal 
cut-off values for GLR. Area under the curve (AUC) analysis was performed to 
compare the performance between GLR and other blood-based inflammatory 
biomarkers. Univariate and multivariate Cox regression analyses were applied to 
select prognostic factors associated with in-hospital mortality. A nomogram 
model was developed based on the identified prognostic factors and the 
validation cohort was used to further validate the nomogram.
RESULTS: The optimal cut-off value for GLR was 0.9. The ROC analyses showed that 
the discrimination abilities of GLR were better than other blood-based 
inflammatory biomarkers. Multivariate Cox regression analysis demonstrated that 
age, platelet, albumin, bilirubin, Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (SOFA) 
score, and GLR are independent predictors of poor overall survival in the 
training cohort and were incorporated into the nomogram for in-hospital 
mortality as independent factors. The nomogram exhibited better discrimination 
with C-indexes in the training cohort and the validation cohort of 0.886 (95% 
CI=0.849-0.922) and 0.841 (95% CI=0.767-0.915), respectively. The calibration 
plot revealed an adequate fit of the nomogram for predicting the risk of 
in-hospital mortality in both sets.
CONCLUSION: As an easily available biomarker, GLR can independently predict the 
in-hospital mortality of critically ill patients with AP. The nomogram combining 
GLR with other significant features exerted favorable predictive performance for 
in-hospital mortality.

BACKGROUND: Septic shock is a lethal disease, and identifying high-risk patients 
through noninvasive and widely available biomarkers can help improve global 
outcomes. While the clinical impact of chloride levels on critically ill 
patients remains unclear, this study aims to investigate the association between 
hypochloremia and mortality following ICU admission among septic shock patients.
METHODS: This is an analysis of data stored in the databases of Medical 
Information Mart for Intensive Care IV (MIMIC-IV). The initial chloride levels 
were classified ashypochloremia, normal chloraemia, and hyperchloraemia. A 
multivariate logistic regression model was applied, adjusting for age, lactate, 
pH, PO2, urine volume, RDW, creatinine, and liver disease, to assess the 
association between the three categories of chloride levels and mortality.
RESULTS: Of 3726 patients included in the study, 470 patients (12.6%) had 
hypochloremia on ICU admission. During the follow-up period, 1120 (33.5%) 
patients died. Hypochloremia was significantly associated with increased 
mortality and the incidence of AKI after adjusting for several variables.
CONCLUSIONS: Hypochloremia is independently associated with higher hospital 
mortality, AKI incidence among septic shock patients. However, further 
high-quality research is necessary to establish the precise relationship between 
hypochloremia and septic shock prognosis.

We developed an interpretable machine learning algorithm that prospectively 
predicts the risk of thrombocytopenia in older critically ill patients during 
their stay in the intensive care unit (ICU), ultimately aiding clinical 
decision-making and improving patient care. Data from 2286 geriatric patients 
who underwent surgery and were admitted to the ICU of Dongyang People's Hospital 
between 2012 and 2021 were retrospectively analyzed. Integrated algorithms were 
developed, and four machine-learning algorithms were used. Selected 
characteristics included common demographic data, biochemical indicators, and 
vital signs. Eight key variables were selected using the Least Absolute 
Shrinkage and Selection Operator and Random Forest Algorithm. Thrombocytopenia 
occurred in 18.2% of postoperative geriatric patients, with a higher mortality 
rate. The C5.0 model showed the best performance, with an area under the 
receiver operating characteristic curve close to 0.85, along with unparalleled 
accuracy, precision, specificity, recall, and balanced accuracy scores of 0.88, 
0.98, 0.89, 0.98, and 0.85, respectively. The support vector machine model 
excelled at predictively assessing thrombocytopenia severity, demonstrating an 
accuracy rate of 0.80 in the MIMIC database. Thus, our machine learning-based 
models have considerable potential in effectively predicting the risk and 
severity of postoperative thrombocytopenia in geriatric ICU patients for better 
clinical decision-making and patient care.

PURPOSE: Cardiac arrest (CA) is the most serious death-related event in 
critically ill patients and the early detection of CA is beneficial to reduce 
mortality according to clinical research. This study aims to develop and verify 
a real-time, interpretable machine learning model, namely cardiac arrest 
prediction index (CAPI), to predict CA of critically ill patients based on 
bedside vital signs monitoring.
METHODS: A total of 1,860 patients were analyzed retrospectively from the 
Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care III (MIMIC-III) database. Based on 
vital signs, we extracted a total of 43 features for building machine learning 
model. Extreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost) was used to develop a real-time 
prediction model. Three-fold cross validation determined the consistency of 
model accuracy. SHAP value was used to capture the overall and real-time 
interpretability of the model.
RESULTS: On the test set, CAPI predicted 95% of CA events, 80% of which were 
identified more than 25 min in advance, resulting in an area under the receiver 
operating characteristic curve (AUROC) of 0.94. The sensitivity, specificity, 
area under the precision-recall curve (AUPRC) and F1-score were 0.86, 0.85, 0.12 
and 0.05, respectively.
CONCLUSION: CAPI can help predict patients with CA in the vital signs monitoring 
at bedside. Compared with previous studies, CAPI can give more timely 
notifications to doctors for CA events. However, current performance was at the 
cost of alarm fatigue. Future research is still needed to achieve better 
clinical application.

BACKGROUND: Sepsis is one of the main causes of mortality in intensive care 
units (ICUs). Early prediction is critical for reducing injury. As approximately 
36% of sepsis occur within 24 h after emergency department (ED) admission in 
Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care (MIMIC-IV), a prediction system for 
the ED triage stage would be helpful. Previous methods such as the quick 
Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (qSOFA) are more suitable for screening than 
for prediction in the ED, and we aimed to find a light-weight, convenient 
prediction method through machine learning.
METHODS: We accessed the MIMIC-IV for sepsis patient data in the EDs. Our 
dataset comprised demographic information, vital signs, and synthetic features. 
Extreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost) was used to predict the risk of developing 
sepsis within 24 h after ED admission. Additionally, SHapley Additive 
exPlanations (SHAP) was employed to provide a comprehensive interpretation of 
the model's results. Ten percent of the patients were randomly selected as the 
testing set, while the remaining patients were used for training with 10-fold 
cross-validation.
RESULTS: For 10-fold cross-validation on 14,957 samples, we reached an accuracy 
of 84.1%±0.3% and an area under the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) 
curve of 0.92±0.02. The model achieved similar performance on the testing set of 
1,662 patients. SHAP values showed that the five most important features were 
acuity, arrival transportation, age, shock index, and respiratory rate.
CONCLUSION: Machine learning models such as XGBoost may be used for sepsis 
prediction using only a small amount of data conveniently collected in the ED 
triage stage. This may help reduce workload in the ED and warn medical workers 
against the risk of sepsis in advance.

We determined the relative strengths of association between 23 most commonly 
ordered laboratory tests and the adverse outcome as indicators of relative 
criticalness. The lowest and highest results for 23 most commonly ordered 
laboratory tests, 24 hours prior to death during critical care unit (CCU) stay 
or discharge from CCU were extracted from a publicly available CCU database 
(Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care-III). Following this, the Random 
Forest model was applied to assess the association between the laboratory 
results and the outcomes (death or discharge). The mean decrease in Gini 
coefficient for each laboratory test was then ranked as an indication of their 
relative importance to the outcome of a patient. In descending order, the 10 
laboratory tests with the strongest association with death were: bicarbonate, 
phosphate, anion gap, white cell count (total), partial thromboplastin time, 
platelet, total calcium, chloride, glucose and INR; moreover, the strength of 
association was different for critically high versus low results.

BACKGROUND: The albumin-bilirubin (ALBI) score has demonstrated prognostic value 
in a range for liver and heart diseases. However, its association with all-cause 
mortality in intensive care unit (ICU) patients with heart failure remains 
uncertain.
OBJECTIVE: This study sought to investigate the relationship between the ALBI 
score and the risk of all-cause mortality in ICU patients with heart failure.
METHODS AND RESULTS: The ICU patients diagnosed with heart failure were selected 
from the Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care IV database (MIMIC-IV, 
version 2.2) and stratified into tertiles according to their ALBI scores. The 
primary outcome of interest was the occurrence of all-cause mortality within 365 
days post-discharge. The analysis encompassed a cohort of 4,239 patients, with 
Kaplan-Meier curves indicating that individuals with higher ALBI levels 
exhibited an elevated risk of all-cause mortality (log-rank p < 0.001). 
Multivariate adjusted Cox regression and subgroup analysis demonstrated that 
individuals in T2 (hazard ratio (HR) 1.09, 95% CI 0.99-1.21) and T3 (HR 1.17, 
95% CI 1.02-1.34) had an increased risk of mortality compared to individuals in 
T1 (p for trend < 0.001), and each incremental tertile in ALBI was linked to a 
10% rise in mortality risk, while each individual unit increase in ALBI was 
associated with a 36% increase in mortality risk. This relationship was 
consistently observed across most subgroups, except for using or not using 
inotropes or vasopressors, different ages, different creatinine levels. The 
restricted cubic spline (RCS) analysis indicated a linear relationship between 
ALBI levels and the risk of all-cause mortality.
CONCLUSION: The ALBI scores are independently associated with the risk of 
all-cause mortality in ICU patients with heart failure, particularly in those 
not using inotropes or vasopressors, younger patients, and with lower levels of 
creatinine. ALBI may help identify high-risk patients and optimize risk 
stratification in this population.

OBJECTIVE: The objective of the present study was to explore the correlation 
between the advanced lung cancer inflammation index (ALI) and in-hospital 
mortality among patients diagnosed with community-acquired pneumonia (CAP).
METHODS: Data from the Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care-IV database 
were adopted to analyze the in-hospital mortality of ICU patients with CAP. Upon 
admission to the ICU, fundamental data including vital signs, critical illness 
scores, comorbidities, and laboratory results, were collected. The in-hospital 
mortality of all CAP patients was documented. Multivariate logistic regression 
(MLR) models and restricted cubic spline (RCS) analysis together with subgroup 
analyses were conducted.
RESULTS: This study includes 311 CAP individuals, involving 218 survivors as 
well as 93 nonsurvivors. The participants had an average age of 63.57 years, and 
the females accounted for approximately 45.33%. The in-hospital mortality was 
documented to be 29.90%. MLR analysis found that ALI was identified as an 
independent predictor for in-hospital mortality among patients with CAP solely 
in the Q1 group with ALI ≤ 39.38 (HR: 2.227, 95% CI: 1.026-4.831, P = 0.043). 
RCS analysis showed a nonlinear relationship between the ALI and in-hospital 
mortality, with a turning point at 81, and on the left side of the inflection 
point, a negative correlation was observed between ALI and in-hospital mortality 
(HR: 0.984, 95% CI: 0.975-0.994, P = 0.002). The subgroup with high blood 
pressure showed significant interaction with the ALI.
CONCLUSION: The present study demonstrated a nonlinear correlation of the ALI 
with in-hospital mortality among individuals with CAP. Additional confirmation 
of these findings requires conducting larger prospective investigations.

OBJECTIVE: Clinical notes contain information that has not been documented 
elsewhere, including responses to treatment and clinical findings, which are 
crucial for predicting key outcomes in patients in acute care. In this study, we 
propose the automatic annotation of phenotypes from clinical notes as a method 
to capture essential information to predict outcomes in the intensive care unit 
(ICU). This information is complementary to typically used vital signs and 
laboratory test results.
METHODS: In this study, we developed a novel phenotype annotation model to 
extract the phenotypical features of patients, which were then used as input 
features of predictive models to predict ICU patient outcomes. We demonstrated 
and validated this approach by conducting experiments on three ICU prediction 
tasks, including in-hospital mortality, physiological decompensation and length 
of stay (LOS) for over 24 000 patients using the Medical Information Mart for 
Intensive Care (MIMIC-III) dataset.
RESULTS: The predictive models incorporating phenotypical information achieved 
0.845 (area under the curve-receiver operating characteristic (AUC-ROC)) for 
in-hospital mortality, 0.839 (AUC-ROC) for physiological decompensation and 
0.430 (kappa) for LOS, all of which consistently outperformed the baseline 
models using only vital signs and laboratory test results. Moreover, we 
conducted a thorough interpretability study showing that phenotypes provide 
valuable insights at both the patient and cohort levels.
CONCLUSION: The proposed approach demonstrates that phenotypical information 
complements traditionally used vital signs and laboratory test results and 
significantly improves the accuracy of outcome prediction in the ICU.

OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to evaluate the predictive capability of glycolipid 
metabolism index (triglyceride-glucose index, TyG; atherogenic index of plasma, 
AIP; triglyceride to high-density lipoprotein cholesterol ratio, TG/HDL-C; and 
non-HDL-C to HDL-C ratio, NHHR) for complications and ventilator use in patients 
with intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH) admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU).
METHODS: Patients with ICH requiring ICU admission were selected from the 
Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care IV (MIMIC-IV) database. Outcomes 
assessed included incidence of complications and use of ventilator support. 
Multivariate logistic regression, receiver operating characteristic (ROC) 
analysis, and restricted cubic spline were employed to investigate the 
relationship between glycolipid metabolism index and clinical outcomes in ICH 
patients.
RESULTS: A total of 733 patients were included. Multivariate logistic regression 
analysis revealed that elevated TyG, AIP, and TG/HDL-C levels were associated 
with increased incidence of complications and prolonged ventilator use. ROC 
curve analysis demonstrated that TyG (AUC 0.646) exhibited the strongest 
predictive ability for multiple complications in ICH patients. Further multiple 
regression analysis identified TG/HDL-C as an independent predictor of deep vein 
thrombosis, while TyG, AIP, and TG/HDL-C independently predicted pulmonary 
embolism, and TyG, AIP, NHHR, and TG/HDL-C independently predicted acute kidney 
injury. Moreover, ventilator use further heightened the risk of multiple 
complications in ICU patients with elevated glycolipid metabolism index.
CONCLUSION: Glycolipid metabolism index represent promising and readily 
accessible biomarkers for predicting multiple complications and ventilator use 
in ICU patients with ICH.

Background: This study aimed to investigate the association between 
triglyceride-glucose (TyG) index and prognosis in critically ill patients with 
acute coronary syndrome (ACS), exploring potential heterogeneity of the 
association among patient subgroups with different characteristics. Methods: 
Records of patients with ACS were extracted from the MIMIC-IV database. The 
association between TyG index and mortality was analyzed using Cox 
proportional-hazard regression model, while potential non-linear associations 
were assessed using restricted cubic spline (RCS) regression. Meanwhile, linear 
regression model was used to explore the association between TyG index and 
length of stay in hospital or ICU. Subpopulation Treatment Effect Pattern Plot 
(STEPP) was utilized to explore the potential heterogeneous subgroups. 
Time-dependent Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) curve analyses were 
performed to compare the predictive ability of different Cox proportional-hazard 
regression models (with or without TyG index). Results: A total of 849 patients 
were enrolled. Multivariate Cox regression analyses demonstrated that TyG index 
was significantly associated with 28-day mortality (HR:2.13 [95%CI: 1.23-3.68], 
P<0.01) and 365-day mortality (HR:1.65 [95%CI: 1.11-2.47], P<0.01). RCS 
regression analyses revealed an inverted U-shaped association between TyG index 
and 28-day mortality (P for non-linearity=0.027) and a linear association 
between TyG index and 365-day mortality (P for non-linearity =0.086). There were 
subgroups specified by age for 28-day mortality (P for interaction=0.04) and 
365-day mortality (P for interaction<0.01), with a cut-off point of 70 years old 
obtained by STEPP. TyG index was associated with a higher risk of mortality in 
subgroups aged ≤ 70 years old. Time-dependent ROC curve suggested that TyG index 
could slightly improve the prediction of mortality. A higher TyG index was 
associated with longer time of stay in hospital (β: 1.79 [95%CI: 0.06-3.52], 
P=0.04). Conclusions: A higher TyG index is associated with both short-term and 
long-term all-cause mortality in critically ill patients with ACS, especially in 
short-term all-cause mortality. TyG index is associated with higher mortality 
risk in patient subgroups aged ≤ 70 years old. A higher TyG index is associated 
with longer time of stay in hospital. TyG index may serve as a useful prognostic 
marker for patient management and strategic decision-making in clinical 
settings.

BACKGROUND: Among critically ill patients, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease 
(COPD) is an independent risk factor for death. Recently, biomarkers such as 
neutrophil-lymphocyte ratio (NLR) and albumin (ALB) have been used to predict 
the prognosis in patients with COPD. However, the association between NLR/ALB 
and all-cause mortality in critically ill COPD patients remains unclear. This 
study aims to explore the association between the NLR/ALB and prognosis in 
critically ill patients with COPD.
METHODS: Data was sourced from the Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care 
IV (MIMIC-IV) database. Primary outcome was 28-day all-cause mortality, with 
secondary outcomes being in-hospital and 90-day all-cause mortality. The area 
under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUROC) was calculated to 
compare prognostic accuracy of NLR, NLR/ALB, PLR, SII and MLR variables. After 
identifying the most predictive factor, KM survival curves, Cox models and 
subgroup analyses were used to examine NLR/ALB's relationship with mortality in 
critically ill COPD patients. Additionally, patients with COPD from the National 
Health and Nutrition Examination Survey data (1999-2018) was used with Cox 
regression to investigate NLR/ALB's correlation with all-cause mortality in COPD 
patients.
RESULTS: 1916 critically ill COPD patients from MIMIC IV, divided into quartiles 
by NLR/ALB levels: Q1 (NLR/ALB<1.108), Q2 (2.095>NLR/ALB≥1.108), Q3 
(4.221>NLR/ALB≥2.095), Q4 (NLR/ALB≥4.221). In multivariate Cox regression, Q4 vs 
Q1: 28-day mortality HR=2.27 (95% CI: 1.63-3.16); 90-day mortality HR=2.06 (95% 
CI: 1.56-2.71); in-hospital mortality HR=1.93 (95% CI: 1.35-2.77); P<0.001. 
Subgroup analyses showed that the correlation between NLR/ALB and 28-day 
mortality was stable Additionally, we recruited 2,003 COPD patients from the 
NHANES that found NLR/ALB also correlated with all-cause mortality in COPD (In 
multivariate Cox regression: Q4 vs Q1 hR=1.92 (95% CI: 1.45-2.55, P<0.001)).
CONCLUSION: Elevated NLR/ALB levels are associated with increased all-cause 
mortality in critically ill patients with COPD.

AIM: To explore the predictive value of lactate-to-albumin ratio (LAR) on 28-day 
mortality in patients with exacerbation of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease 
(AECOPD) admitted to the Intensive Care Unit (ICU).
METHODS: According to ICD-9 and ICD-10 diagnosis codes, patients diagnosed with 
AECOPD in the Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care IV (v.2.2) database 
were selected. The primary endpoint was 28-day mortality after ICU admission. We 
used receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve, Kaplan-Meier (K-M) survival 
curve, logistic regression analyses and subgroup analysis to assess predictive 
power of LAR.
RESULTS: 606 patients were included in this study. The 28-day mortality was 
29.7%. The area under the ROC curves (AUC) for LAR were 0.641 [95% confidence 
interval (CI) 0.592-0.689], which was comparable with OASIS (AUC: 0.662; 95% CI 
0.616-0.709; p = 0.471) and SOFA (AUC: 0.660; 95% CI 0.612-0.708; p = 0.500). 
The cutoff value of LAR was 0.645 by ROC curve. The high-LAR group showed a bad 
prognosis in K-M analysis (p < 0.001). Multivariate logistic regression shown 
that LAR was significantly associated with a poor outcome (odds ratio: 1.77; 95% 
CI 1.16-2.71; p = 0.008). Subgroup analysis showed no significant interaction of 
LAR with each subgroup (p for interaction: 0.175-0.775).
CONCLUSION: LAR is a rational and easily accessible marker, which is remarkably 
associated with 28-day mortality in ICU patients with AECOPD.

BACKGROUND: To investigate the association between serum osmolality and 
deteriorating renal function in patients with acute myocardial infarction (AMI).
METHODS: Three thousand eight hundred eighty-five AMI patients from the Medical 
Information Mart for Intensive Care IV were enrolled for this study. The primary 
outcome was deteriorating renal function. Secondary outcomes included the 
new-onset of acute kidney injury (AKI) and progress of AKI. < 293.2725 mmol/L 
was defined as low serum osmolality, and ≥ 293.2725 mmol/L as high serum 
osmolality based on upper quartile. Univariate and multivariate logistic 
regression models were used to explore the associations between serum osmolality 
and the development of deteriorating renal function, the new-onset of AKI and 
progress of AKI among AMI patients. Subgroup analysis was also conducted.
RESULTS: One thousand three hundred ninety-three AMI patients developed 
deteriorating renal function. After adjusting all confounding factors, high 
serum osmolality was associated with increased risk of deteriorating renal 
function [odds ratio (OR) = 1.47, 95% confidence interval (CI): 1.22-1.78], 
new-onset of AKI (OR = 1.31, 95% CI: 1.01-1.69), and progress of AKI risk 
(OR = 1.26, 95% CI: 1.01-1.59) among AMI patients. In addition, when the 
stratified analysis was performed for age, AMI type, cardiogenic shock, and 
estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR), high serum osmolality was risk 
factor for the risk of deteriorating renal function among patients aged 65 years 
or older, without cardiogenic shock, and with an eGFR ≥ 60 mL/min/1.73m2.
CONCLUSION: Higher serum osmolality increased the risk of deteriorating renal 
function among AMI patients.

OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study was to develop and validate a predictive 
model based on a machine learning (ML) approach to identify patients with DKA at 
increased risk of AKI within 1 week of hospitalization in the intensive care 
unit (ICU).
METHODS: Patients diagnosed with DKA from the Medical Information Mart for 
Intensive Care IV (MIMIC-IV) database according to the International 
Classification of Diseases (ICD)-9/10 code were included. The patient's medical 
history is extracted, along with data on their demographics, vital signs, 
clinical characteristics, laboratory results, and therapeutic measures. The 
best-performing model is chosen by contrasting the 8 Ml models. The area under 
the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC), sensitivity, accuracy, and 
specificity were calculated to select the best-performing ML model.
RESULTS: The final study enrolled 1,322 patients with DKA in total, randomly 
split into training (1,124, 85%) and validation sets (198, 15%). 497 (37.5%) of 
them experienced AKI within a week of being admitted to the ICU. The eXtreme 
Gradient Boosting (XGBoost) model performed best of the 8 Ml models, and the AUC 
of the training and validation sets were 0.835 and 0.800, respectively. 
According to the result of feature importance, the top 5 main features 
contributing to the XGBoost model were blood urea nitrogen (BUN), urine output, 
weight, age, and platelet count (PLT).
CONCLUSION: An ML-based individual prediction model for DKA-associated AKI 
(DKA-AKI) was developed and validated. The model performs robustly, identifies 
high-risk patients early, can assist in clinical decision-making, and can 
improve the prognosis of DKA patients to some extent.

OBJECTIVE: To select variables related to mortality risk of stroke patients in 
intensive care unit (ICU) through long short-term memory (LSTM) with attention 
mechanisms and Logistic regression with L1 norm, and to construct mortality risk 
prediction model based on conventional Logistic regression with important 
variables selected from the two models and to evaluate the model performance.
METHODS: Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care (MIMIC)-Ⅳ database was 
retrospectively analyzed and the patients who were primarily diagnosed with 
stroke were selected as study population. The outcome was defined as whether the 
patient died in hospital after admission. Candidate predictors included 
demogra-phic information, complications, laboratory tests and vital signs in the 
initial 48 h after ICU admission. The data were randomly divided into a training 
set and a test set for ten times at a ratio of 8 ∶2. In training sets, LSTM with 
attention mechanisms and Logistic regression with L1 norm were constructed to 
select important variables. In the test sets, the mean importance of variables 
of ten times was used as a reference to pick out the top 10 variables in each of 
the two models, and then these variables were included in conventional Logistic 
regression to build the final prediction model. Model evaluation was based on 
the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC), sensitivity, 
specificity, and accuracy. And the model performance was compared with the 
forward Logistic regression model which hadn't conducted variable selection 
previously.
RESULTS: A total of 2 755 patients with 2 979 ICU admission records were 
included in the analysis, of which 526 recorded deaths. The AUC of Logistic 
regression model with L1 norm was statistically better than that of LSTM with 
attention mechanisms (0.819±0.031 vs. 0.760±0.018, P < 0.001). Age, blood 
glucose, and blood urea nitrogen were at the top ten important variables in both 
of the two models. AUC, sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy of Logistic 
regression models were 0.85, 85.98%, 71.74% and 74.26%, respectively. And the 
final prediction model was superior to forward Logistic regression model.
CONCLUSION: The variables selected by Logistic regression with L1 norm and LSTM 
with attention mechanisms had good prediction performance, which showed 
important implications on the mortality prediction of stroke patients in ICU.

memory，LSTM)和L1正则化的Logistic回归筛选变量，再通过传统的Logistic回归建立重症监护病房(intensive care 
unit，ICU)脑卒中患者院内死亡风险预测模型并评价模型效果。
方法: 选取重症医学信息数据库(Medical Information Mart for Intensive 
Care-Ⅳ，MIMIC-Ⅳ)中的脑卒中患者作为研究对象，以是否发生院内死亡作为结局变量，备选预测因子包括人口学特征、合并症、入院48

∶2的比例随机进行10次训练集和测试集的划分，在训练集上构建LSTM和L1正则化的Logistic回归模型，在测试集上选取重要程度排名前10的变量的并集纳入Logistic回归建立预测模型，以受试者工作特征曲线下面积(area 
under curve, AUC)、灵敏度、特异度、预测准确度为指标对模型进行评价，并与未预先进行变量筛选的前进法Logistic回归模型的预测效果进行比较。
结果: 共纳入2 755例脑卒中患者的2 
979条ICU入院记录，其中院内死亡记录占17.66%。两个变量筛选模型中，L1正则化的Logistic回归模型的AUC显著优于LSTM模型(0.819±0.031 
vs. 0.760±0.018, P < 
0.001)，两个模型中重要程度均位于前10的变量包括年龄、血糖和尿素氮。最终预测模型的AUC为0.85，灵敏度为85.98%，特异度为71.74%，预测准确率为74.26%，优于未预先进行变量筛选的前进法Logistic回归模型。
结论: 用引入注意力机制的LSTM和L1正则的Logistic回归筛选出的变量的预测效果较好，具有一定的临床价值。

BACKGROUND: Serum lactate is associated with mortality in diverse kinds of 
patients. This study aimed to investigate whether serum lactate level may 
independently predict mortality in acute kidney injury (AKI) patients.
METHODS: A total of 4461 AKI patients were collected from the Medical 
Information Mart for Intensive Care (MIMIC III) database and followed up for 
365 days. According to serum lactate tertiles, participants were divided into 
three groups (Q1-Q3) by: Q1 ≤ 1.60 mg/dl, Q2 = 1.61-2.70 mg/dl, and 
Q3 ≥ 2.71 mg/dl. We calculated the hazard ratio (HR) and 95% confidence 
intervals (Cls) for mortality across each tertile of lactate by using the Q1 as 
reference and constructed four models to adjust for the HR of mortality.
RESULTS: Nonsurvivors had significantly higher lactate compared with patients in 
the survival group. Mortality rate gradually elevated with the increase in serum 
lactate level (Q1: 29.30%, Q2: 33.40%, Q3: 37.40%). When compared with Q1 after 
adjustment of all confounders, the HRs of Q3 still was 1.20 (95% Cl 1.05-1.37).
CONCLUSIONS: This study demonstrated that high serum lactate levels were an 
independent predictor of mortality in AKI patients.

BACKGROUND: Previous models on prediction of shock mostly focused on septic 
shock and often required laboratory results in their models. The purpose of this 
study was to use deep learning approaches to predict vasopressor requirement for 
critically ill patients within 24 h of intensive care unit (ICU) admission using 
only vital signs.
METHODS: We used data from the Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care III 
database and the eICU Collaborative Research Database to develop a vasopressor 
prediction model. We performed systematic data preprocessing using matching of 
cohorts, oversampling, and imputation to control for bias, class imbalance, and 
missing data. Bidirectional long short-term memory (Bi-LSTM), a multivariate 
time series model, was used to predict the need for vasopressor therapy using 
serial physiological data collected 21 h prior to prediction time.
RESULTS: Using data from 10,941 critically ill patients from 209 ICUs, our model 
achieved an initial area under the curve of 0.96 (95% CI 0.96-0.96) to predict 
the need for vasopressor therapy in 2 h within the first day of ICU admission. 
After matching to control class imbalance, the Bi-LSTM model had area under the 
curve of 0.83 (95% CI 0.82-0.83). Heart rate, respiratory rate, and mean 
arterial pressure contributed most to the model.
CONCLUSIONS: We used Bi-LSTM to develop a model to predict the need for 
vasopressor for critically ill patients for the first 24 h of ICU admission. 
With attention mechanism, respiratory rate, mean arterial pressure, and heart 
rate were identified as key sequential determinants of vasopressor requirements.

AIM: To investigate the relationship between the ionized-to-total calcium ratio 
and the incidence of acute kidney injury (AKI) in critically ill patients with 
autoimmune diseases.
METHODS: A retrospective study was conducted utilizing data from the Medical 
Information Mart for Intensive Care IV database. In-hospital AKI was the primary 
outcome. Patients were classified into four distinct categories depending on the 
calcium ratio. Cox proportional hazards model and restricted cubic spline (RCS) 
analysis were applied to assess the association between the calcium ratio and 
AKI risk. Subgroup analyses were conducted to evaluate the consistency of this 
association across various patient characteristics.
RESULTS: A total of 1054 critically ill patients with autoimmune diseases were 
enrolled and stratified by calcium ratio quartiles into four groups (< 0.515; 
0.515-0.546; 0.546-0.576; > 0.576). Cumulative incidence curves showed 
significant difference in AKI risk among the four groups. Patients in the 
highest calcium ratio quartile experienced a markedly reduced likelihood of AKI 
versus those in the lowest, especially in the fully adjusted model (HR = 0.66, 
95% CI 0.51-0.84, p < 0.001). RCS analysis demonstrated an obvious nonlinear 
relationship, showing a steep decline in AKI risk with increasing calcium ratio, 
which eventually plateaued. This protective effect of higher calcium ratios 
against AKI was consistent across subgroups, except in those with chronic kidney 
disease at baseline.
CONCLUSION: The ionized-to-total calcium ratio proves to be significantly 
associated with the development of AKI in critically ill patients with 
autoimmune diseases, with its elevation indicating a reduced AKI risk.

OBJECTIVES: Developing and validating interpretable machine learning (ML) models 
for predicting whether triaged patients need to be admitted to the intensive 
care unit (ICU).
MEASURES: The study analyzed 189,167 emergency patients from the Medical 
Information Mart for Intensive Care IV database, with the outcome being ICU 
admission. Three models were compared: Model 1 based on Emergency Severity Index 
(ESI), Model 2 on vital signs, and Model 3 on vital signs, demographic 
characteristics, medical history, and chief complaints. Nine ML algorithms were 
employed. The area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC), F1 
Score, Positive Predictive Value, Negative Predictive Value, Brier score, 
calibration curves, and decision curves analysis were used to evaluate the 
performance of the models. SHapley Additive exPlanations was used for explaining 
ML models.
RESULTS: The AUC of Model 3 was superior to that of Model 1 and Model 2. In 
Model 3, the top four algorithms with the highest AUC were Gradient Boosting 
(0.81), Logistic Regression (0.81), naive Bayes (0.80), and Random Forest 
(0.80). Upon further comparison of the four algorithms, Gradient Boosting was 
slightly superior to Random Forest and Logistic Regression, while naive Bayes 
performed the worst.
CONCLUSIONS: This study developed an interpretable ML triage model using vital 
signs, demographics, medical history, and chief complaints, proving more 
effective than traditional models in predicting ICU admission. Interpretable ML 
aids clinical decisions during triage.

BACKGROUND: Heart failure (HF) combined with diabetes is highly prevalent and is 
associated with more severe left ventricular dysfunction and a higher mortality 
rate. Early prediction of prognosis in such patients is crucial. This study aims 
to investigate the relationship between the lactate-to-albumin ratio (LAR) and 
outcomes in critically ill patients diagnosed with HF and diabetes.
METHODS: Data on critically ill HF patients with diabetes were retrospectively 
collected from the Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care IV (MIMIC-IV) 
database. Restricted cubic spline (RCS) analysis identified a threshold value of 
0.44, dividing patients into low-LAR (< 0.44) and high-LAR (≥ 0.44) groups. 
Least Absolute Shrinkage and Selection Operator (LASSO) regression with tenfold 
cross-validation identified variables associated with mortality. RCS, 
Kaplan-Meier curves, and Cox regression analyses were employed to evaluate the 
association between LAR and mortality. Subgroup analyses were conducted to 
validate the robustness of the findings.
RESULTS: A total of 3,774 patients were included, with a determined LAR cutoff 
value of 0.44. RCS analysis revealed a positive correlation between LAR and 
all-cause mortality at 90 days, 180 days, and 1 year. Cox regression analysis 
showed that both low-LAR and high-LAR groups were independent risk factors for 
all-cause mortality at 90 days, 180 days, and 1 year in HF patients with 
diabetes (P < 0.05). Kaplan-Meier survival curves demonstrated that the 
cumulative survival rates at 90 days, 180 days, and 1 year were lower in the 
low-LAR group compared to the high-LAR group. Subgroup analyses confirmed the 
stability of the association between LAR and all-cause mortality at all time 
points.
CONCLUSION: In summary, LAR is a reliable and independent predictor of increased 
mortality in critically ill HF patients with diabetes. However, additional 
comprehensive prospective studies are needed to validate these findings.

Background: Acute ischemic stroke is a leading cause of death in the United 
States. Identifying patients with stroke at high risk of mortality is crucial 
for timely intervention and optimal resource allocation. This study aims to 
develop and validate machine learning-based models to predict in-hospital 
mortality risk for intensive care unit (ICU) patients with acute ischemic stroke 
and identify important associated factors. Methods: Our data include 3,489 acute 
ischemic stroke admissions to the ICU for patients not discharged or dead within 
48 h from the Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care-IV (MIMIC-IV) 
database. Demographic, hospitalization type, procedure, medication, intake 
(intravenous and oral), laboratory, vital signs, and clinical assessment [e.g., 
Glasgow Coma Scale Scores (GCS)] during the initial 48 h of admissions were used 
to predict in-hospital mortality after 48 h of ICU admission. We explored 3 
machine learning models (random forests, logistic regression, and XGBoost) and 
applied Bayesian optimization for hyperparameter tuning. Important features were 
identified using learned coefficients. Results: Experiments show that XGBoost 
tuned for area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC ROC) was 
the best performing model (AUC ROC 0.86, F1 0.52), compared to random forests 
(AUC ROC 0.85, F1 0.47) and logistic regression (AUC ROC 0.75, F1 0.40). Top 
features include GCS, blood urea nitrogen, and Richmond RASS score. The model 
also demonstrates good fairness for males versus females and across 
racial/ethnic groups. Conclusions: Machine learning has shown great potential in 
predicting in-hospital mortality risk for people with acute ischemic stroke in 
the ICU setting. However, more ethical considerations need to be applied to 
ensure that performance differences across different racial/ethnic groups will 
not exacerbate existing health disparities and will not harm historically 
marginalized populations.

BACKGROUND: Both blood urea nitrogen (BUN) and creatinine (Cr) are indicators of 
kidney function, and the BUN/Cr ratio has been identified as an independent 
prognostic marker for adverse outcomes in critically ill patients with various 
conditions. However, the relationship between the BUN/Cr ratio and long-term 
mortality in critically ill patients with acute pancreatitis (AP) remains 
unclear. Hence, the primary objective of this study was to determine the 
prognostic value of the BUN/Cr ratio in patients with AP.
METHODS: We conducted a retrospective cohort study using data from the Medical 
Information Mart for Intensive Care IV (MIMIC-IV) database. The primary exposure 
variable was the BUN/Cr ratio at intensive care unit (ICU) admission, and the 
primary outcome was 365-day all-cause mortality. Kaplan-Meier analyses and 
multivariate Cox proportional hazards models were used to assess this 
relationship, while restricted cubic spline (RCS) was used to explore potential 
non-linear associations. In addition, subgroup analyses were conducted to assess 
consistency between groups.
RESULTS: A total of 850 critically ill patients with AP were included, with a 
mean age of 59.61 years, 58.59% male, and an overall 365-day mortality rate of 
20.94%. Patients in the highest BUN/Cr quartile had significantly higher 
mortality rates compared to those in lower quartiles. Multivariate Cox 
regression analysis demonstrated that, even after adjusting for potential 
confounders, an elevated BUN/Cr ratio remained an independent predictor of 
increased 28-day and 365-day mortality. RCS analysis confirmed a J-shaped 
relationship between the BUN/Cr ratio and 28-day and 365-day mortality, with a 
sharp increase in the risk of death above the 16.80 threshold. Subgroup analysis 
indicated that this association was consistent across various patient 
characteristics.
CONCLUSION: This study identified a non-linear relationship between the BUN/Cr 
ratio and 365-day mortality in critically ill patients with AP, suggesting that 
the BUN/Cr ratio may serve as an easily accessible, cost-effective, and accurate 
prognostic marker for this population.

Healthcare.

Teng F, Ma Z, Chen J, Xiao M, Huang L.

With the development of healthcare 4.0, there has been an explosion in the 
amount of data such as image, medical text, physiological signals, lab tests, 
etc. Among them, medical records provide a complete picture of the associated 
clinical events. However, the processing of medical texts is difficult because 
they are structurally free, diverse in style, and have subjective factors. 
Assigning metadata codes from the International Classification of Diseases (ICD) 
presents a standardized way of indicating diagnoses and procedures, so it 
becomes a mandatory process for understanding medical records to make better 
clinical and financial decisions. Such a manual encoding task is time-consuming, 
error-prone and expensive. In this paper, we proposed a deep learning approach 
and a medical topic mining method to automatically predict ICD codes from 
text-free medical records. The result of the F1 score on Medical Information 
Mart for Intensive Care (MIMIC-III) dataset increases by 5% over the state of 
art. It also suitable for multiple ICD versions and languages. For the specific 
disease, atrial fibrillation, the F1 score is up to 96% and 93.3% using in-house 
ICD-10 datasets and MIMIC-III datasets, respectively. We developed an Artificial 
Intelligence based coding system, which can greatly improve the efficiency and 
accuracy of human coders, and meanwhile accelerate the secondary use for 
clinical informatics.

BACKGROUND Sepsis-associated acute kidney injury (SA-AKI) is linked to high 
mortality rates and an unfavorable prognosis. Early identification of patients 
with poor prognosis is crucial. This study aimed to investigate the relationship 
between the systemic immune-inflammation index (SII) and mortality in this 
specific patient population. MATERIAL AND METHODS This retrospective cohort 
study used data from the Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care IV 
database. Data on patient demographics, comorbidities, vital signs, laboratory 
parameters, treatment usage, acute kidney injury staging, and renal replacement 
therapy were collected within 48 h of intensive care unit admission. Restricted 
cubic splines, Kaplan-Meier curves, and Cox regression models were used for 
analysis. Stratified analyses were performed on the basis of various factors. 
RESULTS In total, 7856 patients were included, with a median age of 66.9 years 
and a male-to-female ratio of 57.7%-42.3%. A J-shaped relationship was observed 
between SII and mortality risk. The lowest mortality risk occurred at an SII of 
760.078×10⁹/L. Compared to the reference group (second quartile of SII), the 
highest and third quartiles had increased 28-day mortality risk, with adjusted 
hazard ratios (HRs) of 1.33 (1.16-1.52) and 1.55 (1.36-1.77), respectively. 
Although a trend towards higher mortality hazard was observed in the lowest SII 
group (Q1), it was not statistically significant, with an adjusted HR of 1.15 
(1-1.32). CONCLUSIONS In patients with SA-AKI, both low and high SII were 
associated with increased short-term mortality risk. The lowest mortality risk 
was observed at an SII of 760.078×10⁹/L within a 28-day period.

RATIONALE: Patients transferred from the intensive care unit to the wards who 
are later readmitted to the intensive care unit have increased length of stay, 
healthcare expenditure, and mortality compared with those who are never 
readmitted. Improving risk stratification for patients transferred to the wards 
could have important benefits for critically ill hospitalized patients.
OBJECTIVES: We aimed to use a machine-learning technique to derive and validate 
an intensive care unit readmission prediction model with variables available in 
the electronic health record in real time and compare it to previously published 
algorithms.
METHODS: This observational cohort study was conducted at an academic hospital 
in the United States with approximately 600 inpatient beds. A total of 24,885 
intensive care unit transfers to the wards were included, with 14,962 transfers 
(60%) in the training cohort and 9,923 transfers (40%) in the internal 
validation cohort. Patient characteristics, nursing assessments, International 
Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision codes from prior admissions, 
medications, intensive care unit interventions, diagnostic tests, vital signs, 
and laboratory results were extracted from the electronic health record and used 
as predictor variables in a gradient-boosted machine model. Accuracy for 
predicting intensive care unit readmission was compared with the Stability and 
Workload Index for Transfer score and Modified Early Warning Score in the 
internal validation cohort and also externally using the Medical Information 
Mart for Intensive Care database (n = 42,303 intensive care unit transfers).
RESULTS: Eleven percent (2,834) of discharges to the wards were later readmitted 
to the intensive care unit. The machine-learning-derived model had significantly 
better performance (area under the receiver operating curve, 0.76) than either 
the Stability and Workload Index for Transfer score (area under the receiver 
operating curve, 0.65), or Modified Early Warning Score (area under the receiver 
operating curve, 0.58; P value < 0.0001 for all comparisons). At a specificity 
of 95%, the derived model had a sensitivity of 28% compared with 15% for 
Stability and Workload Index for Transfer score and 7% for the Modified Early 
Warning Score. Accuracy improvements with the derived model over Modified Early 
Warning Score and Stability and Workload Index for Transfer were similar in the 
Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care-III cohort.
CONCLUSIONS: A machine learning approach to predicting intensive care unit 
readmission was significantly more accurate than previously published algorithms 
in both our internal validation and the Medical Information Mart for Intensive 
Care-III cohort. Implementation of this approach could target patients who may 
benefit from additional time in the intensive care unit or more frequent 
monitoring after transfer to the hospital ward.

BACKGROUND: Serum anion gap (AG) has been proven to be associated with prognosis 
in critically ill patients. However, few studies have investigated the 
association between AG and all-cause mortality in critically ill patients with 
chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD).
OBJECTIVE: We hypothesized that the initial AG level would predict the mortality 
risk in critically ill patients with COPD.
METHODS: This retrospective cohort study was based on the Medical Information 
Mart for Intensive Care (MIMIC) IV database. We extracted demographics, vital 
signs, laboratory tests, comorbidity, and scoring systems from the first 24 
hours after patient ICU admission. Multivariable logistic regression analysis 
models were used to explore the association between serum AG levels and 
mortality. Interaction and stratified analyses were conducted including age, 
gender and comorbidity.
RESULTS: A total of 5531 critically ill patients with COPD were enrolled, 
composed of 53.6% male and 46.4% female with a median age of 73 years. The 
all-cause mortality of these patients during ICU hospitalization was 13.7%. The 
risk of all-cause mortality increased as the AG level increased in the 
univariate logistic regression analysis (OR=1.13, 95% CI: 1.11-1.15, p<0.01). 
After adjusting for all the covariates in multivariate logistic regression 
analysis, the odds ratio was 1.06 (95% CI: 1.04-1.09, p<0.01). Compared with the 
lowest AG group Q1 (≤11mmol/L), the adjusted OR value for AG and mortality in Q2 
(12-13mmol/L) was 0.89 (95% CI: 0.63-1.25, p=0.502), Q3 (14-15mmol/L) was 0.95 
(95% CI: 0.68-1.34, p=0.788), and Q4 (≥16mmol/L) was 1.49 (95% CI: 1.10-2.02, 
p=0.009) respectively. In addition, the results of the subgroup and stratified 
analyses were robust.
CONCLUSION: AG is positively related to all-cause mortality in critically ill 
patients with COPD.

BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Sepsis-associated AKI is a heterogeneous clinical 
entity. We aimed to agnostically identify sepsis-associated AKI subphenotypes 
using deep learning on routinely collected data in electronic health records.
DESIGN, SETTING, PARTICIPANTS, & MEASUREMENTS: We used the Medical Information 
Mart for Intensive Care III database, which consists of electronic health record 
data from intensive care units in a tertiary care hospital in the United States. 
We included patients ≥18 years with sepsis who developed AKI within 48 hours of 
intensive care unit admission. We then used deep learning to utilize all 
available vital signs, laboratory measurements, and comorbidities to identify 
subphenotypes. Outcomes were mortality 28 days after AKI and dialysis 
requirement.
RESULTS: We identified 4001 patients with sepsis-associated AKI. We utilized 
2546 combined features for K-means clustering, identifying three subphenotypes. 
Subphenotype 1 had 1443 patients, and subphenotype 2 had 1898 patients, whereas 
subphenotype 3 had 660 patients. Subphenotype 1 had the lowest proportion of 
liver disease and lowest Simplified Acute Physiology Score II scores compared 
with subphenotypes 2 and 3. The proportions of patients with CKD were similar 
between subphenotypes 1 and 3 (15%) but highest in subphenotype 2 (21%). 
Subphenotype 1 had lower median bilirubin levels, aspartate aminotransferase, 
and alanine aminotransferase compared with subphenotypes 2 and 3. Patients in 
subphenotype 1 also had lower median lactate, lactate dehydrogenase, and white 
blood cell count than patients in subphenotypes 2 and 3. Subphenotype 1 also had 
lower creatinine and BUN than subphenotypes 2 and 3. Dialysis requirement was 
lowest in subphenotype 1 (4% versus 7% [subphenotype 2] versus 26% [subphenotype 
3]). The mortality 28 days after AKI was lowest in subphenotype 1 (23% versus 
35% [subphenotype 2] versus 49% [subphenotype 3]). After adjustment, the 
adjusted odds ratio for mortality for subphenotype 3, with subphenotype 1 as a 
reference, was 1.9 (95% confidence interval, 1.5 to 2.4).
CONCLUSIONS: Utilizing routinely collected laboratory variables, vital signs, 
and comorbidities, we were able to identify three distinct subphenotypes of 
sepsis-associated AKI with differing outcomes.

BACKGROUND: There is need to identify biomarkers for prognosis of acute 
respiratory distress syndrome (ADRS). This may allow early and accurate 
identification of patients with high-risk ARDS to guide adjustment of clinical 
treatment and nursing intervention, which would ultimately improve prognosis of 
patients with ARDS. Biomarkers based on a combination of fasting glucose and 
lymphocyte counts to predict prognosis in critically ill patients with ARDS 
remain undefined. In this study, we investigated the association between 
glucose-to-lymphocyte ratio (GLR) and in-hospital mortality.
METHODS: The study obtained data from Medical Information Mart for Intensive 
Care-IV (MIMIC-IV Version 1.0) database. We defined the GLR as fasting 
glucose/lymphocyte count and the patient in-hospital mortality was considered as 
the outcome. In addition, we employed linear and logistic regression models for 
analysis.
RESULTS: In total, 1,085 patients with ARDS were included in this study. The 
eligible participants included 498 female and 587 males, with a mean age of 
64.2 ± 17.5 years. Logistic regression analysis demonstrated that higher GLR was 
an independent risk factor for all-cause mortality (OR =1.67, 95% CI: 1.26-2.22) 
after adjusting for age, sex, anion gap, white blood cell count, congestive 
heart failure, sequential organ failure assessment (SOFA), SBP, DBP, and 
respiratory rate in both the dichotomized group and subgroups. We also analyzed 
the in-hospital mortality to ROC curves by comparing the value between 
SOFA + GLR and SOFA. The area under the curve (AUC) was 0.6991 for the 
SOFA + GLR (95% CI: 0.6634-0.7348), and 0.6613 for the SOFA (95% CI: 
0.6238-0.6988).
CONCLUSION: Our data showed that the GLR was an independent predictor of 
in-hospital mortality for patients with ARDS. The GLR is an integrated, readily 
available clinical biomarker for mortality in patients with ARDS.

BACKGROUND: The Triglyceride-Glucose (TyG) index, a reliable marker for insulin 
resistance, is now employed to assess the onset and prognosis of various 
conditions like acute coronary syndrome, chronic kidney disease, and ischemic 
stroke. However, whether the TyG index can be used to assess respiratory failure 
(RF) risk among Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) patients remains 
uncertain. The present study aims to delve into the link between the TyG index 
and the risk of RF in COPD patients.
METHODS: Individuals with COPD were retrospectively acquired from the MIMIC-IV 
2.2 (The Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care IV, version 2.2) database. 
The association between the TyG index and the probability of RF among COPD 
patients was evaluated using Cox proportional hazards models and restricted 
cubic spline (RCS) curves. Cumulative incidence curves were generated to 
appraise the RF risk across the quartile groups. Finally, 1188 patients were 
recruited from the First Hospital of Jiaxing City to externally validate the Cox 
modeling results for the primary outcome.
RESULTS: This study incorporated a total of 1,232 participants from MIMIC 
database. Among these individuals, 134 cases (10.9%) experienced RF. According 
to Cox regression analysis, a one-unit increment in the TyG index was linked to 
a 1.821-fold elevated risk of RF in the COPD population (HR, 1.821[95% CI 
1.349-2.459], P < 0.001). High TyG index levels were significantly linked to a 
higher RF risk (HR, 3.510 [95% CI 1.885-6.535], P < 0.001). RCS curve analysis 
also signaled a linear correlation between the TyG index and RF risk 
(P-Nonlinear = 0.074).
CONCLUSION: There exists a certain correlation between high-level TyG index and 
the risk of RF occurrence in COPD patients, indicating promising prospects for 
utilizing the TyG index to assess the severity of COPD patients.

AIM: Acute kidney injury (AKI) and coagulation disorders are two common 
complications of traumatic brain injury (TBI) that are associated with poor 
prognosis. However, the relationship between early coagulation disorders and the 
risk of severe AKI in TBI patients remains unclear. This study aimed to explore 
the association between early coagulation disorders and the risk of severe AKI 
in TBI patients admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU).
METHODS: In this retrospective cohort study, adults diagnosed with TBI were 
selected from the Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care (MIMIC)-IV 
database. The outcome was the risk of severe AKI within 7 days of ICU admission 
in TBI patients. Covariates including sociodemographic information, vital signs, 
scoring systems, and laboratory parameters were extracted from the database. 
Univariable and multivariable Cox proportional hazard regression models were 
used to assess the association between early coagulation disorders and the risk 
of severe AKI within 7 days of admission to the ICU in TBI patients. Subgroup 
analyses based on age and the Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) score were further 
conducted to assess the association.
RESULTS: A total of 846 patients were finally included, of whom 187 (22.10%) had 
severe AKI. After adjusting for all covariates, the TBI patients with early 
coagulation disorders had a higher risk of developing severe AKI within 7 days 
of ICU admission compared to the TBI patients without early coagulation 
disorders (hazard ratio (HR) = 1.40, 95% confidence interval (CI): 1.04-1.89), 
particularly among those aged ≥65 years (HR = 1.46, 95%CI: 1.01-2.04) and those 
with a GCS score ≤ 13 (HR = 1.91, 95%CI: 1.16-3.15).
CONCLUSION: TBI patients with early coagulation disorders had a higher risk of 
developing severe AKI within 7 days of ICU admission. This may serve as a 
promising biomarker and could be helpful for managing kidney health in TBI 
patients.

OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to develop and validate several artificial 
intelligence (AI) models to identify acute myocardial infarction (AMI) patients 
at an increased risk of acute kidney injury (AKI) during hospitalization.
METHODS: Included were patients diagnosed with AMI from the Medical Information 
Mart for Intensive Care (MIMIC) III and IV databases. Two cohorts of AMI 
patients from Changzhou Second People's Hospital and Xuzhou Center Hospital were 
used for external validation of the models. Patients' demographics, vital signs, 
clinical characteristics, laboratory results, and therapeutic measures were 
extracted. Totally, 12 AI models were developed. The area under the receiver 
operating characteristic curve (AUC) were calculated and compared.
RESULTS: AKI occurred during hospitalization in 1098 (28.3 %) of the 3882 final 
enrolled patients, split into training (3105) and test (777) sets randomly. 
Among them, Random Forest (RF), C5.0 and Bagged CART models outperformed the 
other models in both the training and test sets. The AUCs for the test set were 
0.754, 0.734 and 0.730, respectively. The incidence of AKI was 9.8 % and 9.5 % 
in 2202 patients in the Changzhou cohort and 807 patients in the Xuzhou cohort 
with AMI, respectively. The AUCs for patients in the Changzhou cohort were RF, 
0.761; C5.0, 0.733; and bagged CART, 0.725, respectively, and Xuzhou cohort were 
RF, 0.799; C5.0, 0.808; and bagged CART, 0.784, respectively.
CONCLUSION: Several machines learning-based prediction models for AKI after AMI 
were developed and validated. The RF, C5.0 and Bagged CART model performed 
robustly in identifying high-risk patients earlier.

AIMS: Serum calcium level is widely used for evaluating disease severity, but 
its impact on clinical outcomes in patients with congestive heart failure (CHF) 
remains poorly understood. The aim of this study is to investigate the 
relationship between serum calcium levels and in-hospital mortality in CHF 
patients.
METHODS AND RESULTS: We conducted a retrospective analysis utilizing clinical 
data from the Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care database, encompassing 
a cohort of 15 983 CHF patients. This cohort was stratified based on their serum 
calcium levels, with the primary objective being the determination of 
in-hospital mortality. To assess the impact of admission serum calcium levels on 
in-hospital mortality, we employed various statistical methodologies, including 
multivariable logistic regression models, a generalized additive model, a 
two-piecewise linear regression model, and subgroup analysis. Comparative 
analysis of the reference group (Q3) revealed increased in-hospital mortality in 
the first quintile (Q1, the group with the lowest blood calcium level) and the 
fifth quintile (Q5, the group with the highest blood calcium level), with fully 
adjusted odds ratios of 1.38 [95% confidence interval (CI): 1.13-1.68, 
P = 0.002] and 1.23 (95% CI: 1.01-1.5, P = 0.038), respectively. A U-shaped 
relationship was observed between serum calcium levels and in-hospital 
mortality, with the lowest risk occurring at a threshold of 8.35 mg/dL. The 
effect sizes and corresponding CIs below and above this threshold were 0.782 
(95% CI: 0.667-0.915, P = 0.0023) and 1.147 (95% CI: 1.034-1.273, P = 0.0094), 
respectively. Stratified analyses confirmed the robustness of this correlation.
CONCLUSIONS: Our study identifies a U-shaped association between serum calcium 
levels and in-hospital mortality in CHF patients, with a notable inflection 
point at 8.35 mg/dL. Further investigation through prospective, randomized, and 
controlled studies is warranted to validate the findings presented in this 
study.

BACKGROUND: Sepsis is a serious disease with high clinical morbidity and 
mortality. Despite the tremendous advances in medicine and nursing, treatment of 
sepsis remains a huge challenge. Our purpose was to explore the effects of shock 
index (SI) trajectory changes on the prognosis of patients within 24 h after the 
diagnosis of sepsis.
METHODS: This study was based on Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care IV 
(MIMIC- IV). The effects of SI on the prognosis of patients with sepsis were 
investigated using C-index and restricted cubic spline (RCS). The trajectory of 
SI in 24 h after sepsis diagnosis was classified by latent growth mixture 
modeling (LGMM). Cox proportional hazard model, double robust analysis, and 
subgroup analysis were conducted to investigate the influence of SI trajectory 
on in-hospital death and secondary outcomes.
RESULTS: A total of 19,869 patients were eventually enrolled in this study. 
C-index showed that SI had a prognostic value independent of Sequential Organ 
Failure Assessment for patients with sepsis. Moreover, the results of RCS showed 
that SI was a prognostic risk factor. LGMM divided SI trajectory into seven 
classes, and patients with sepsis in different classes had notable differences 
in prognosis. Compared with the SI continuously at a low level of 0.6, the SI 
continued to be at a level higher than 1.0, and the patients in the class whose 
initial SI was at a high level of 1.2 and then declined had a worse prognosis. 
Furthermore, the trajectory of SI had a higher prognostic value than the initial 
SI.
CONCLUSION: Both initial SI and trajectory of SI were found to be independent 
factors that affect the prognosis of patients with sepsis. Therefore, in 
clinical treatment, we should closely monitor the basic vital signs of patients 
and arrive at appropriate clinical decisions on basis of their change 
trajectory.

On average, more than 5 million patients are admitted to intensive care units 
(ICUs) in the US, with mortality rates ranging from 10 to 29%. The acuity state 
of patients in the ICU can quickly change from stable to unstable, sometimes 
leading to life-threatening conditions. Early detection of deteriorating 
conditions can assist in more timely interventions and improved survival rates. 
While Artificial Intelligence (AI)-based models show potential for assessing 
acuity in a more granular and automated manner, they typically use mortality as 
a proxy of acuity in the ICU. Furthermore, these methods do not determine the 
acuity state of a patient (i.e., stable or unstable), the transition between 
acuity states, or the need for life-sustaining therapies. In this study, we 
propose APRICOT-M (Acuity Prediction in Intensive Care Unit-Mamba), a 
1M-parameter state space-based neural network to predict acuity state, 
transitions, and the need for life-sustaining therapies in real-time among ICU 
patients. The model integrates ICU data in the preceding four hours (including 
vital signs, laboratory results, assessment scores, and medications) and patient 
characteristics (age, sex, race, and comorbidities) to predict the acuity 
outcomes in the next four hours. Our state space-based model can process sparse 
and irregularly sampled data without manual imputation, thus reducing the noise 
in input data and increasing inference speed. The model was trained on data from 
107,473 patients (142,062 ICU admissions) from 55 hospitals between 2014-2017 
and validated externally on data from 74,901 patients (101,356 ICU admissions) 
from 143 hospitals. Additionally, it was validated temporally on data from 
12,927 patients (15,940 ICU admissions) from one hospital in 2018-2019 and 
prospectively on data from 215 patients (369 ICU admissions) from one hospital 
in 2021-2023. Three datasets were used for training and evaluation: the 
University of Florida Health (UFH) dataset, the electronic ICU Collaborative 
Research Database (eICU), and the Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care 
(MIMIC)-IV dataset. APRICOT-M significantly outperforms the baseline acuity 
assessment, Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (SOFA), for mortality prediction 
in both external (AUROC 0.95 CI: 0.94-0.95 compared to 0.78 CI: 0.78-0.79) and 
prospective (AUROC 0.99 CI: 0.97-1.00 compared to 0.80 CI: 0.65-0.92) cohorts, 
as well as for instability prediction (external AUROC 0.75 CI: 0.74-0.75 
compared to 0.51 CI: 0.51-0.51, and prospective AUROC 0.69 CI: 0.64-0.74 
compared to 0.53 CI: 0.50-0.57). This tool has the potential to help clinicians 
make timely interventions by predicting the transition between acuity states and 
decision-making on life-sustaining within the next four hours in the ICU.

BACKGROUND: Acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) is a life-threatening 
disease for which biomarkers to predict mortality are needed. Total bilirubin 
(TBIL), an end-product of hemoglobin catabolism in mammals reflecting liver 
dysfunction, has been demonstrated as an independent risk indicator for 
critically ill patients. This study aimed to examine whether TBIL on intensive 
care unit (ICU) admission is associated with ARDS mortality.
METHODS: We analyzed the data of patients diagnosed with ARDS according to the 
Berlin definition from the Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care IV 
(MIMIC-IV) database. The primary endpoint was 30-day ICU mortality after 
admission to the ICU, and the second endpoint was in-hospital mortality. 
Multivariable logistic analysis adjusted for potential confounders was used to 
determine the association between TBIL and short-term mortality.
RESULTS: Of 1,539 ARDS patients enrolled, 261 patients died within 30 days of 
admission to the ICU. In the multivariable logistic analysis, each 1 g/dL 
increase in TBIL levels led to a 4% increase in the odds of 30-day ICU mortality 
[adjusted odds ratio (OR) =0.04; 95% confidence interval (CI): 0.01 to 0.08] and 
a 4% increase in the odds of in-hospital mortality (adjusted OR =0.04; 95% CI: 
0.01 to 0.07). Furthermore, TBIL levels ≥2 mg/dL were significantly associated 
with 30-day ICU mortality (adjusted OR =1.51, 95% CI: 1.02 to 1.07) and 
in-hospital mortality (OR =1.41; 95% CI: 1.01 to 1.87). Similarly, associations 
between serum TBIL levels and 30-day ICU mortality were found in all subgroups 
stratified by comorbidities, the severity of ARDS, and other variables.
CONCLUSIONS: A higher serum TBIL on ICU admission was independently associated 
with mortality in ARDS patients. Intensive care and observation should be 
provided to ARDS patients with increased TBIL.

BACKGROUND: Although protective mechanical ventilation (MV) has been used in a 
variety of applications, lung injury may occur in both patients with and without 
acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). The purpose of this study is to use 
machine learning to identify clinical phenotypes for critically ill patients 
with MV in intensive care units (ICUs).
METHODS: A retrospective cohort study was conducted with 5013 patients who had 
undergone MV and treatment in the Department of Critical Care Medicine, Peking 
Union Medical College Hospital. Statistical and machine learning methods were 
used. All the data used in this study, including demographics, vital signs, 
circulation parameters and mechanical ventilator parameters, etc., were 
automatically extracted from the electronic health record (EHR) system. An 
external database, Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care III (MIMIC III), 
was used for validation.
RESULTS: Phenotypes were derived from a total of 4009 patients who underwent MV 
using a latent profile analysis of 22 variables. The associations between the 
phenotypes and disease severity and clinical outcomes were assessed. Another 
1004 patients in the database were enrolled for validation. Of the five derived 
phenotypes, phenotype I was the most common subgroup (n = 2174; 54.2%) and was 
mostly composed of the postoperative population. Phenotype II (n = 480; 12.0%) 
led to the most severe conditions. Phenotype III (n = 241; 6.01%) was associated 
with high positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) and low mean airway pressure. 
Phenotype IV (n = 368; 9.18%) was associated with high driving pressure, and 
younger patients comprised a large proportion of the phenotype V group (n = 746; 
18.6%). In addition, we found that the mortality rate of Phenotype IV was 
significantly higher than that of the other phenotypes. In this subgroup, the 
number of patients in the sequential organ failure assessment (SOFA) score 
segment (9,22] was 198, the number of deaths was 88, and the mortality rate was 
higher than 44%. However, the cumulative 28-day mortality of Phenotypes IV and 
II, which were 101 of 368 (27.4%) and 87 of 480 (18.1%) unique patients, 
respectively, was significantly higher than those of the other phenotypes. There 
were consistent phenotype distributions and differences in biomarker patterns by 
phenotype in the validation cohort, and external verification with MIMIC III 
further generated supportive results.
CONCLUSIONS: Five clinical phenotypes were correlated with different disease 
severities and clinical outcomes, which suggested that these phenotypes may help 
in understanding heterogeneity in MV treatment effects.

Evidence regarding the relationship between age-adjusted Charlson comorbidity 
index (ACCI) and in-hospital mortality is limited. Therefore, the present study 
investigated whether there was an independent association between ACCI and 
in-hospital mortality in critically ill patients with cardiogenic shock (CS) 
after adjusting for other covariates (age, sex, history of disease, scoring 
system, in-hospital management, vital signs at presentation, laboratory ﬁndings 
and vasopressors). ACCI, calculated retrospectively after hospitalization 
between 2008 and 2019, was derived from intensive care unit (ICU) admissions at 
the Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center (Boston, MA, USA). Patients with CS 
were classified into two categories based on predefined ACCI scores (low, <8; 
high, ≥8). Based on baseline ACCI, the risk of in-hospital mortality in patients 
with CS was calculated using a multivariate Cox proportional risk model, and the 
threshold effect was calculated using a two-piece linear regression model. The 
in-hospital mortality rate was ~1.5 times greater in the ACCI high group 
compared with that in the ACCI low group [hazard ratio (HR)=1.45; 95% confidence 
interval (CI), 1.14-1.86]. Additional analysis showed that ACCI had a 
curvilinear association with in-hospital mortality risk in patients with CS, 
with a saturation effect predicted at 4.5. When ACCI was >4.5, the risk of 
in-hospital CS death increased signiﬁcantly with increasing ACCI (HR=1.122; 95% 
CI, 1.054-1.194). Overall, ACCI was an independent predictor of in-hospital 
mortality in ICU patients with CS. A non-linear relationship was revealed 
between ACCI and in-hospital mortality, where in-hospital mortality increased 
significantly when ACCI was >4.5.

Sepsis results in various patient complications and is due to a heightened 
inflammatory response against infection. This condition requires further 
exploration of biomarkers. We employed an "in silico" method comprised of 
text-mining and additionally clinical validation through the Medical Information 
Mart for Intensive Care. We highlight that Factor VIII shows potential as a 
pertinent septic shock biomarker.

BACKGROUND: It is crucial to identify patients at high risk for acute 
respiratory failure (ARF) to provide appropriate and optimal clinical treatment. 
While previous studies have explored the use of prognostic biomarkers based on a 
combination of blood urea nitrogen (BUN) and albumin levels, no reports to date 
have evaluated its utility across a wide range of ARF etiologies in a large and 
diverse critical care population. Therefore, we aimed to ascertain the 
association between the BUN-to-albumin ratio (BAR) and mortality in these 
patients.
METHODS: Data recorded in the first 24 h following intensive care unit (ICU) 
admission, including demographics, vital signs, laboratory test results, 
comorbidities, and score systems were retrieved from the Medical Information 
Mart for Intensive Care IV (MIMIC-IV) database. A general additive model was 
used to determine whether there was a non-linear relationship between BAR and 
30-day mortality. A multivariate Cox analysis was performed to measure the 
association between them.
RESULTS: The study enrolled 9,734 patients with ARF. In comparison to survivors, 
non-survivors exhibited higher BAR [10.79 (6.25-18.81) vs. 7.35 (4.48-13.62), 
P<0.001]. The correlation between baseline BAR and 30-day all-cause mortality in 
patients with ARF was non-linear, with a significant inflection point (11.76 
mg/g). The Kaplan-Meier curve demonstrated that ARF patients had higher 30-day 
all-cause mortality rates when they had higher BAR levels (>11.76 mg/g) with 
hazard ratio (HR) 1.54 [95% confidence interval (CI): 1.39-1.70].
CONCLUSIONS: A high BAR was linked to a higher risk of mortality in ARF 
patients. BAR is a straightforward and possibly useful prognostic biomarker for 
ARF.

Previous studies have shown an independent association between increased red 
cell distribution width (RDW) and mortality after acute myocardial infarction 
(AMI). However, evidence regarding the predictive significance of repeated 
measures of RDW in patients with AMI remains scarce. We aimed to investigate the 
association between the dynamic profile of RDW and in-hospital mortality in 
patients with AMI.This was a cross-sectional study. We extracted clinical data 
from the Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care IIIV1.4 database. 
Demographic data, vital signs, laboratory test data, and comorbidities were 
collected from the database. The clinical endpoint was in-hospital mortality. 
Cox proportional hazards models were used to evaluate the prognostic values of 
basic RDW, and the Kaplan-Meier method was used to plot survival curves. 
Subgroup analyses were performed to measure mortality across various subgroups. 
The repeated-measures data were compared using a generalized additive mixed 
model.In total, 3101eligible patients were included. In multivariate analysis, 
adjusted for age, sex, and ethnicity, RDW was a significant risk predictor of 
in-hospital mortality. Furthermore, after adjusting for more confounding 
factors, RDW remained a significant predictor of in-hospital mortality (tertile 
3 vs tertile 1: hazard ratio 2.3; 95% confidence interval 1.39-4.01; P for trend 
<.05). The Kaplan-Meier curve for tertiles of RDW indicated that survival rates 
were highest when RDW was ≤13.2% and lowest when RDW was ≥14.2% after adjustment 
for age, sex, and ethnicity. During the intensive care unit stay, the RDW of 
nonsurvivors progressively increased until death occurred.Our findings showed 
that a higher RDW was associated with an increased risk of in-hospital mortality 
in patients with AMI.

Unnecessary antibiotic regimens in the intensive care unit (ICU) are associated 
with adverse patient outcomes and antimicrobial resistance. Bacterial infections 
(BI) are both common and deadly in ICUs, and as a result, patients with a 
suspected BI are routinely started on broad-spectrum antibiotics prior to having 
confirmatory microbiologic culture results or when an occult BI is suspected, a 
practice known as empiric antibiotic therapy (EAT). However, EAT guidelines lack 
consensus and existing methods to quantify patient-level BI risk rely largely on 
clinical judgement and inaccurate biomarkers or expensive diagnostic tests. As a 
consequence, patients with low risk of BI often are continued on EAT, exposing 
them to unnecessary side effects. Augmenting current intuition-based practices 
with data-driven predictions of BI risk could help inform clinical decisions to 
shorten the duration of unnecessary EAT and improve patient outcomes. We propose 
a novel framework to identify ICU patients with low risk of BI as candidates for 
earlier EAT discontinuation. For this study, patients suspected of having a 
community-acquired BI were identified in the Medical Information Mart for 
Intensive Care III (MIMIC-III) dataset and categorized based on microbiologic 
culture results and EAT duration. Using structured longitudinal data collected 
up to 24-, 48-, and 72-hours after starting EAT, our best models identified 
patients at low risk of BI with AUROCs up to 0.8 and negative predictive values 
>93%. Overall, these results demonstrate the feasibility of forecasting BI risk 
in a critical care setting using patient features found in the electronic health 
record and call for more extensive research in this promising, yet relatively 
understudied, area.

OBJECTIVE: To develop and validate a mechanical power (MP)-oriented nomogram 
prediction model of weaning failure in mechanically ventilated patients.
METHODS: Patients who underwent invasive mechanical ventilation (IMV) for more 
than 24 hours and were weaned using a T-tube ventilation strategy were collected 
from the Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care-IV v1.0 (MIMIC-IV v1.0) 
database. Demographic information and comorbidities, respiratory mechanics 
parameters 4 hours before the first spontaneous breathing trial (SBT), 
laboratory parameters preceding the SBT, vital signs and blood gas analysis 
during SBT, length of intensive care unit (ICU) stay and IMV duration were 
collected and all eligible patients were enrolled into the model group. Lasso 
method was used to screen the risk factors affecting weaning outcomes, which 
were included in the multivariate Logistic regression analysis. R software was 
used to construct the nomogram prediction model and build the dynamic web page 
nomogram. The discrimination and accuracy of the nomogram were assessed by 
receiver operator characteristic curve (ROC curve) and calibration curves, and 
the clinical validity was assessed by decision curve analysis (DCA). The data of 
patients undergoing mechanical ventilation hospitalized in ICU of the First 
People's Hospital of Lianyungang City and the Second People's Hospital of 
Lianyungang City from November 2021 to October 2022 were prospectively collected 
to externally validate the model.
RESULTS: A total of 3 695 mechanically ventilated patients were included in the 
model group, and the weaning failure rate was 38.5% (1 421/3 695). Lasso 
regression analysis finally screened out six variables, including positive 
end-expiratory pressure (PEEP), MP, dynamic lung compliance (Cdyn), inspired 
oxygen concentration (FiO2), length of ICU stay and IMV duration, with 
coefficients of 0.144, 0.047, -0.032, 0.027, 0.090 and 0.098, respectively. 
Logistic regression analysis showed that the six variables were all independent 
risk factors for predicting weaning failure risk [odds ratio (OR) and 95% 
confidence interval (95%CI) were 1.155 (1.111-1.200), 1.048 (1.031-1.066), 0.968 
(0.963-0.974), 1.028 (1.017-1.038), 1.095 (1.076-1.113), and 1.103 
(1.070-1.137), all P < 0.01]. The MP-oriented nomogram prediction model of 
weaning failure in mechanically ventilated patients showed accurate 
discrimination both in the model group and external validation group, with area 
under the ROC curve (AUC) and 95%CI of 0.832 (0.819-0.845) and 0.879 
(0.833-0.925), respectively. Furthermore, its predictive accuracy was 
significantly higher than that of individual indicators such as MP, Cdyn, and 
PEEP. Calibration curves showed good correlation between predicted and observed 
outcomes. DCA indicated that the nomogram model had high net benefits, and was 
clinically beneficial.
CONCLUSIONS: The MP-oriented nomogram prediction model of weaning failure 
accurately predicts the risk of weaning failure in mechanical ventilation 
patients and provides valuable information for clinicians making decisions on 
weaning.

OBJECTIVE: To investigate the risk factors affecting the prognosis of patients 
with acute kidney injury (AKI) in the intensive care unit (ICU) based on the 
Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care III (MIMIC-III) database, and to 
establish a prognostic model for AKI.
METHODS: Patients (aged ≥ 18 years) with acute renal failure, admitted to the 
ICU for the first time, and had complete hospital records (the RIFLE diagnostic 
criteria were used in the database, and the diagnosis was expressed as AKI in 
this article) were screened from MIMIC-III database according to diagnostic 
codes. Patients were divided into two groups based on survival state at 
discharge, and the general information, underlying diseases, injury factors, 
vital signs and laboratory indicators within 24 hours after AKI, related 
intervention and prognostic indicators were analyzed. Univariate and 
multivariate Logistic regression analysis were used to determine the risk 
factors affecting mortality in patients with AKI and established a prediction 
model. The receiver operator characteristic curve (ROC curve) was used to 
analyze the predictive value of the prediction model for the prognosis of AKI 
patients.
RESULTS: There were 4 554 patients with AKI included and 862 died, with 
mortality of 18.93%. Univariate Logistic regression analysis was performed for 
factors that might be associated with death in AKI patients, and the results 
showed that age, hypertension, lymphoma, metastatic carcinoma, vancomycin, 
aspirin, coagulation abnormalities, cardiac arrest, sepsis or septic shock, 
invasive mechanical ventilation, white blood cell count (WBC), platelet count 
(PLT), K+, blood urea nitrogen (BUN), total bilirubin (TBil), renal replacement 
therapy (RRT) and length of stay (LOS) were independent risk factors [odds ratio 
(OR) and 95% confidence interval (95%CI) were 1.002 (1.001-1.003), 0.764 
(0.618-0.819), 1.749 (1.112-2.752), 2.606 (1.968-3.451), 1.779 (1.529-2.071), 
0.689 (0.563-0.842), 1.871 (1.590-2.201), 2.468 (1.209-5.036), 2.610 
(2.226-3.060), 2.154 (1.853-2.505), 1.105 (1.009-1.021), 0.998 (0.997-0.998), 
1.132 (1.057-1.212), 1.008 (1.006-1.011), 1.061 (1.049-1.073), 2.142 
(1.793-2.997), 0.805 (0.778-1.113), all P < 0.05]. Further binary Logistic 
regression analysis showed that lymphoma, metastatic cancer, vancomycin, cardiac 
arrest, sepsis or septic shock, coagulation dysfunction, invasive mechanical 
ventilation, increased BUN, increased TBil, increased or decreased blood K+ and 
increased WBC were independent risk factors for death [β values were 0.636, 
1.005, 0.207, 0.894, 0.787, 0.346, 0.686, 0.006, 0.051, 0.085, and 0.009; OR and 
95%CI were 1.889 (1.177-3.031), 2.733 (2.027-3.683), 1.229 (1.040-1.453), 2.445 
(1.165-5.133), 2.197 (1.850-2.610), 1.413 (1.183-1.689), 1.987 (1.688-2.338), 
1.006 (1.003-1.009), 1.052 (1.039-1.065), 1.089 (1.008-1.176), and 1.009 
(1.004-1.015), respectively, all P < 0.05]. The Hosmer-Lemeshow test showed that 
the AKI prognostic model was able to fit the observed data well (P = 0.604). ROC 
curve analysis showed that the area under ROC curve (AUC) of the AKI prognostic 
model was 0.716 (95%CI was 0.697-0.735), when the cut-off value was 0.320, the 
sensitivity was 71.9%, the specificity was 60.1%, the positive likelihood ratio 
was 1.80, and the negative likelihood ratio was 0.47.
CONCLUSIONS: The prognostic prediction model of AKI in critically ill patients 
established and based on the MIMIC-III database may have practical significance 
for prognostic risk assessment of AKI and later intervention.

Sepsis-associated encephalopathy (SAE) is defined as a dysfunction of the 
central nervous system experienced during sepsis with variable clinical 
features. The study aims to identify the prognostic role of urinary ketone 
bodies in relation to clinical outcomes in patients with SAE. The Medical 
Information Mart for Intensive Care III (MIMIC-III) database was used to conduct 
a retrospective cohort study. We recruited 427 patients with SAE admitted to the 
intensive care unit (ICU) from the MIMIC-III database. Patients with SAE were 
divided into a survival group (380 patients) and a non-survival group (47 
patients). We used the Wilcoxon signed-rank test and the multivariate logistic 
regression analysis to analyze the relationship between the level of urinary 
ketone bodies and the clinical prognosis in patients with SAE. The primary 
outcome was the relationship between urinary ketone body levels and 28-day 
mortality of SAE. The secondary outcomes were the relationship between urinary 
ketone body levels and length of ICU stays, Simplified Acute Physiology Score 
II, Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (SOFA), Glasgow Coma Scale, mechanical 
ventilation, renal replacement therapy, and the use of vasopressors. The 28-day 
mortality of patients with SAE was 11.0%. Urinary ketone body levels were not 
significantly associated with the 28-day mortality of patients with SAE. Urinary 
ketone body levels were associated with SOFA score and the use of vasopressors 
in patients with SAE. The SOFA score was an independent risk factor for the 
28-day mortality in patients with SAE. Urinary ketone body levels were 
significantly associated with SOFA score and the use of vasopressors in patients 
with SAE. Furthermore, the SOFA score can predict the prognosis of short-term 
outcomes of patients with SAE. Therefore, we should closely monitor the changes 
of urinary ketone bodies and SOFA score and intervene in time.

BACKGROUND: This study examines the relationship between Hb, RDW and their 
association and both short-term and long-term mortality in patients with acute 
aortic dissection (AAD), aiming to establish combined effect between Hb and RDW 
as a potential prognostic biomarker for AAD outcomes.
METHODS: We extracted clinical data from the Medical Information Mart for 
Intensive Care (MIMIC) databases for this analysis. Using adjusted Cox 
regression and Kaplan-Meier survival curve analyses, we assessed the 
relationship between Hb, RDW and their association at admission and mortality at 
multiple post-discharge intervals (30 days, 90 days, 1 year, and 5 years) among 
patients with AAD. Additionally, subgroup analyses and receiver operating 
characteristic (ROC) curve analyses were conducted to evaluate the predictive 
accuracy of Hb, RDW and their association for mortality in this patient 
population.
RESULTS: High RDW combined with low Hb (RDW ≥ 13.60 and Hb < 7.9) significantly 
predicted increased mortality at 30 days, 90 days, 1 year, and 5 years 
post-diagnosis, with hazard ratios (HRs) as follows: 4.33 (95% CI: 1.82-10.33, 
P < 0.001), 4.48 (95% CI: 2.06-9.77, P < 0.001), 3.38 (95% CI: 1.70-6.70, 
P < 0.001), and 3.07 (95% CI: 1.66-5.66, P < 0.001), respectively.
CONCLUSION: Hb and RDW are both abnormal (Hb with low level, RDW with high 
level) is positively correlated with 30 days, 90 days, 1 year, and 5 years 
mortality risk in patients with AAD. This suggests that combined effect between 
Hb and RDW is a significant predictor of short-term to long-term mortality risk 
in this patient population, highlighting its potential utility as a prognostic 
marker in clinical settings.

The Surviving Sepsis Campaign Guidelines 2021 recommends that adult patients 
with sepsis requiring intensive care should be admitted to the ICU within 6 
hours of their emergency department (ED) visits. However, there is limited 
evidence on whether 6 hours is the best target time for compliance with the 
sepsis bundle. We aimed to investigate the association between time from ED 
visits to ICU admission (i.e., ED length of stay [ED-LOS]) and mortality and 
identify the optimal ED-LOS for patients with sepsis.
DESIGN: Retrospective cohort study.
SETTING: The Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care Emergency Department 
and Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care IV databases.
PATIENTS: Adult patients (≥ 18 yr old) who were transferred from the ED to the 
ICU and subsequently diagnosed with sepsis based on the Sepsis-3 criteria within 
24 hours of ICU admission.
INTERVENTIONS: None.
MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Among 1,849 patients with sepsis, we found a 
disproportionally higher mortality rate in patients immediately admitted to the 
ICU (e.g., < 2 hr). When using ED-LOS as a continuous variable, ED-LOS was not 
significantly associated with 28-day mortality (adjusted odds ratio [OR] per 
hour increase, 1.04; 95% CI, 0.96-1.13; p = 0.3) after an adjustment for 
potential confounders (e.g., demographics, triage vital signs, and laboratory 
results) in the multivariable analysis. However, when we categorized all 
patients into time quartiles (ED-LOS: < 3.3 hr, 3.3-4.5 hr, 4.6-6.1 hr, and > 
6.1 hr), patients in the higher time quartiles (e.g., 3.3-4.5 hr) had higher 
28-day mortality compared with those in the lowest time quartile (< 3.3 hr) 
(e.g., adjusted OR for patients in the second time quartile [3.3-4.5 hr] 1.59; 
95% CI, 1.03-2.46; p = 0.04).
CONCLUSIONS: Earlier admission to the ICU (e.g., within 3.3 hr of ED visits) was 
associated with lower 28-day mortality in patients with sepsis. Our findings 
suggest patients with sepsis who require intensive care may benefit from a more 
immediate ICU admission than 6 hours.

BACKGROUND: Machine learning has advanced medical event prediction, mostly using 
private data. The public MIMIC-3 (Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care 
III) data set, which contains detailed data on over 40,000 intensive care unit 
patients, stands out as it can help develop better models including structured 
and textual data.
OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to build and test a machine learning model using the 
MIMIC-3 data set to determine the effectiveness of information extracted from 
electronic medical record text using a named entity recognition, specifically 
QuickUMLS, for predicting important medical events. Using the prediction of 
extended-spectrum β-lactamase (ESBL)-producing bacterial infections as an 
example, this study shows how open data sources and simple technology can be 
useful for making clinically meaningful predictions.
METHODS: The MIMIC-3 data set, including demographics, vital signs, laboratory 
results, and textual data, such as discharge summaries, was used. This study 
specifically targeted patients diagnosed with Klebsiella pneumoniae or 
Escherichia coli infection. Predictions were based on ESBL-producing bacterial 
standards and the minimum inhibitory concentration criteria. Both the structured 
data and extracted patient histories were used as predictors. In total, 2 
models, an L1-regularized logistic regression model and a LightGBM model, were 
evaluated using the receiver operating characteristic area under the curve 
(ROC-AUC) and the precision-recall curve area under the curve (PR-AUC).
RESULTS: Of 46,520 MIMIC-3 patients, 4046 were identified with bacterial 
cultures, indicating the presence of K pneumoniae or E coli. After excluding 
patients who lacked discharge summary text, 3614 patients remained. The 
L1-penalized model, with variables from only the structured data, displayed a 
ROC-AUC of 0.646 and a PR-AUC of 0.307. The LightGBM model, combining structured 
and textual data, achieved a ROC-AUC of 0.707 and a PR-AUC of 0.369. Key 
contributors to the LightGBM model included patient age, duration since hospital 
admission, and specific medical history such as diabetes. The structured 
data-based model showed improved performance compared to the reference models. 
Performance was further improved when textual medical history was included. 
Compared to other models predicting drug-resistant bacteria, the results of this 
study ranked in the middle. Some misidentifications, potentially due to the 
limitations of QuickUMLS, may have affected the accuracy of the model.
CONCLUSIONS: This study successfully developed a predictive model for 
ESBL-producing bacterial infections using the MIMIC-3 data set, yielding results 
consistent with existing literature. This model stands out for its transparency 
and reliance on open data and open-named entity recognition technology. The 
performance of the model was enhanced using textual information. With 
advancements in natural language processing tools such as BERT and GPT, the 
extraction of medical data from text holds substantial potential for future 
model optimization.

Continuous Blood Pressure Estimation From Non-Invasive Measurements Using 
Support Vector Regression.

Rastegar A S, GholamHosseini A H, Lowe A A, Linden B M.

Blood pressure (BP) is one of the most crucial vital signs of the human body 
that can be assessed as a critical risk factor for severe health conditions such 
as cardiovascular diseases (CVD) and hypertension. An accurate, continuous, and 
cuff-less BP monitoring technique could help clinicians improve the prevention, 
detection, and diagnosis of hypertension and manage related treatment plans. 
Notably, the complex and dynamic nature of the cardiovascular system 
necessitates that any BP monitoring system could benefit from an intelligent 
technology that can extract and analyze compelling BP features. In this study, a 
support vector regression (SVR) model was developed to estimate systolic blood 
pressure (SBP) and diastolic blood pressure (DBP) continuously. We selected a 
set of features commonly used in previous studies to train the proposed SVR 
model. A total of 120 patients with available ECG, PPG, DBP and SBP data were 
chosen from the Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care (MIMIC III) dataset 
to validate the proposed model. The results showed that the average root mean 
square error (RMSE) of 2.37 mmHg and 4.18 mmHg were achieved for SBP and DBP, 
respectively.

INTRODUCTION: Numerous diseases have been found to be associated with the 
lactate-to-albumin ratio (LAR), as confirmed by existing research. This study 
aims to investigate the relationship between LAR within 24 hours of admission 
and a 28-day mortality rate in patients manifesting ischemic stroke.
METHODS: This retrospective cohort study utilized data from the Medical 
Information Mart for Intensive Care IV (MIMIC-IV, version 2.1) database. We 
included adult patients with acute ischemic stroke (AIS) who were admitted to 
the intensive care unit. The primary outcome entailed evaluating the ability of 
LAR to predict death at 28-day of hospital admission in patients with AIS.
RESULTS: A total of 502 patients with ischemic stroke were enrolled in the 
study, of which 185 (36.9 %) died within 28 days after hospital admission. We 
identified a linear association between LAR and mortality risk. Compared with 
the reference group (first LAR tertile), the 28-day mortality was increased in 
the highest tertile; the fully adjusted HR value was 1.21 (1.08 to 1.40). the 
Area Under the Curve (AUC) value for LAR was 58.26 % (95 % CI: 53.05 % - 63.46 
%), which was higher than that for arterial blood lactate (AUC = 56.88 %) and 
serum albumin (AUC = 55.29 %) alone. It was not inferior even when compared to 
SOFA (AUC = 56.28 %). The final subgroup analysis exhibited no significant 
interaction of LAR with each subgroup (P for interaction: 0.079 - 0.848).
CONCLUSION: In our study, LAR emerged as a promising predictor of all-cause 
mortality in acute ischemic stroke patients within 28 days of admission.

OBJECTIVE: Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is a leading cause of 
global morbidity and death. The blood urea nitrogen-to-creatinine ratio (BCR) is 
recognized as a crucial marker to assess renal function and cardiovascular risk. 
Nevertheless, the effects of BCR on COPD patients suffering comorbid congestive 
heart failure (CHF) is not clarified. This study aims to elucidate the 
association between BCR and CHF risk in the COPD population.
METHODS: Data from COPD patients meeting the eligibility criteria were from the 
Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care IV (MIMIC-IV) database. The 
cumulative incidence curve was utilized for examining the link of BCR to CHF. 
Kaplan-Meier (KM) analysis was carried out for evaluating the relation of BCR to 
in-hospital mortality(IHM). Multivariable Cox regression assisted in assessing 
the correlation of BCR with CHF risk. Restricted cubic splines (RCS) were 
leveraged for unraveling the association of BCR (as a continuous variable) with 
CHF.
RESULTS: Our study included 2,840 COPD patients in the intensive care unit for 
the first time, with hospital stays exceeding 24 h. The incidence of CHF was 
57.18% among these patients. Cumulative incidence curve analysis demonstrated a 
notably increased CHF incidence in patients having higher BCR 
(18.889 < BCR ≤ 92.5) in contrast to those with lower BCR (2.877 ≤ BCR ≤ 18.889) 
(p < 0.0001). KM survival analysis indicated a markedly elevated IHM risk in 
patients with higher BCR in comparison to those with lower BCR (p < 0.0001). 
Multivariable Cox regression and RCS analysis further confirmed that higher BCR 
was linked to a risen likelihood of CHF [hazard ratio (HR) = 1.28, 95% 
confidence interval (CI, 1.15-1.44), p < 0.001]. Subgroup analysis revealed a 
higher risk of CHF [HR = 1.41, 95% CI (1.13-1.76), p = 0.002] in patients with 
diabetes than those without [HR = 1.24, 95% CI (1.08-1.41), p = 0.002].
CONCLUSION: Elevated BCR is an independent risk factor for CHF in critically ill 
COPD individuals and strongly related to a risen risk of CHF. The findings prove 
BCR as a reliable clinical predictor, facilitating risk stratification and 
personalized treatment for COPD patients with comorbid CHF.

BACKGROUND: The growing population of elderly neurocritically ill patients 
highlights the need for effective prognosis prediction tools. This study aims to 
develop and validate machine learning (ML) models for predicting 28-day 
mortality in intensive care units (ICUs).
METHODS: Data were extracted from the Medical Information Mart for Intensive 
Care IV(MIMIC-IV) database, focusing on elderly neurocritical ill patients with 
ICU stays ≥ 24 h. The cohort was split into 70 % for training and 30 % for 
internal validation. We analyzed 58 variables, including demographics, vital 
signs, medications, lab results, comorbidities, and medical scores, using Lasso 
regression to identify predictors of 28-day mortality. Seven ML algorithms were 
evaluated, and the best model was validated with data from Guizhou Medical 
University Affiliated Hospital. A log-rank test was used to assess survival 
differences in Kaplan-Meier curves. Shapley Additive Explanations (SHAP) were 
used to interpret the best model, while subgroup analysis identified variations 
in model performance across different populations.
RESULTS: The study included 1,773 elderly neurocritically ill patients, with a 
28-day mortality rate of 28.6 %. The Light Gradient Boosting Machine (LightGBM) 
outperformed other models, achieving an area under the curve (AUC) of 0.896 in 
internal validation and 0.812 in external validation. Kaplan-Meier analysis 
showed that higher LightGBM prediction scores correlated with lower survival 
probabilities. Key predictors identified through SHAP analysis included partial 
pressure of arterial carbon dioxide (PaCO2), Acute physiology and chronic health 
evaluation II (APACHE II), white blood cell count, age, and lactate. The 
LightGBM model demonstrated consistent performance across various subgroups.
CONCLUSIONS: The LightGBM model effectively predicts 28-day mortality risk in 
elderly neurocritically ill patients, aiding clinicians in management and 
resource allocation. Its reliable performance across diverse subgroups 
underscores its clinical utility.

BACKGROUND: Heart failure (HF) is a common cardiovascular disease, which is 
related to systemic inflammation for decades. Fibrinogen (FIB) is a sign of 
thrombosis and inflammation, which is associated with the prognosis of many 
diseases. Nevertheless, the role of fibrinogen level in the prognosis of 
critically ill patients with acute exacerbation of chronic heart failure is 
unclear.
METHODS: The data are from the Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care III 
(MIMIC III) database, which is a freely accessible critical care database. The 
primary outcome in our study was 90-day mortality. The prognostic value of 
fibrinogen was analyzed with receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve 
analysis, Kaplan-Meier curve, and Cox model.
RESULTS: A total of 554 patients were included. Patients were divided into two 
groups, low fibrinogen level (<284 mg/dl) and high fibrinogen level 
(≥284 mg/dl), through the cut-off value of the ROC curve. The area under the ROC 
curve of fibrinogen for predicting 90-day mortality was 0.65 (95% CI: 
0.59-0.70). In the unadjusted Cox model, compared with the low fibrinogen level 
(<284 mg/dl), the 90-day mortality of the hazard ratio (HR) with 95% confidence 
intervals (CI) of the high fibrinogen level is 3.33 (95% CI 2.15-5.15). In 
different multivariable Cox models, compared with the low fibrinogen level 
(<284 mg/dl), the 90-day mortality of the hazard ratio of the high fibrinogen 
level is from 2.83 to 3.13. In subgroup analyses, significant interactions were 
observed only in age, chronic kidney disease (CKD), and APS III scores.
CONCLUSION: Our data suggest that high fibrinogen levels (≥284 mg/dl) 
independently predict mortality in critically ill patients with acute 
exacerbation of chronic heart failure. Our findings need to be further validated 
by large prospective studies and longer follow-up time.

BACKGROUND: The relationship between albumin-corrected anion gap (ACAG) and 
in-hospital mortality in critically ill patients with COPD remains unclear.
OBJECTIVE: This study investigated the association between ACAG levels and the 
risk of in-hospital mortality in critically ill patients with COPD.
DESIGN: A retrospective cohort study.
METHODS: This study uses data from the Medical Information Mart for Intensive 
Care (MIMIC-IV) database. The receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve was 
used to determine the optimal threshold for ACAG, and participants were divided 
into two categories based on this threshold. The primary outcome was in-hospital 
mortality. We employed univariable and multivariable logistic regression 
analyses and Kaplan-Meier (KM) survival curves to assess the relationship 
between ACAG and the risk of in-hospital mortality. Moreover, subgroup analyses 
were conducted.
RESULTS: A total of 2121 patients (54.7% male) were enrolled in the study. The 
in-hospital mortality rate was 18.9%. In patients with elevated ACAG levels, the 
in-hospital mortality rate was significantly higher than in those with lower 
ACAG levels (27.7% vs 11.3%, p < 0.001). Multivariate logistic regression 
analysis indicated that even after mitigating for potential confounders, 
patients in the high ACAG group had significantly greater odds of in-hospital 
mortality across all models (Model I: OR = 3.000, 95% CI: 2.383-3.777, 
p < 0.001; Model II: OR = 3.021, 95% CI: 2.397-3.808, p < 0.001; Model III: 
OR = 1.916, 95% CI: 1.458-2.519, p < 0.001). Patients with elevated ACAG levels 
have more than twice the risk of in-hospital mortality compared to those with 
lower levels (hazard ratio (HR): 2.1277, 95% CI: 1.7490-2.5884).
CONCLUSION: This study demonstrates that elevated ACAG levels are strongly 
associated with an increased risk of in-hospital mortality in critically ill 
COPD patients, suggesting that ACAG could serve as a potential predictor of 
adverse outcomes in this patient population.

Metabolic acidosis is usually associated with the severity of the condition of 
patients with sepsis or septic shock. Serum anion gap (AG) is one of the 
indicators of response metabolism. This study was performed to investigate 
whether the initial serum AG is associated with the 28-day mortality in 
critically ill adult patients with sepsis. This retrospective cohort study, a 
total of 15,047 patients with confirmed Sepsis disease from 2008 to 2019 from 
the Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care IV (MIMIC-IV) v1.0 database. The 
MIMIC-IV database is a comprehensive, de-identified clinical dataset originating 
from the Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center in Boston, it includes extensive 
data on intensive care unit (ICU) patients, such as vital signs, lab results, 
and medication orders, spanning multiple years, accessible to researchers 
through an application process. AG can be obtained by direct extraction in the 
MIMIC-IV database (itemid = 50,868 from the laboratory events table of 
mimic_hosp), inclusion of AG values for the first test on first day of ICU 
admission. The patients were grouped into quartiles according to the AG 
interquartile range. The primary outcome was the 28-day mortality. Multiple 
logistic regression analysis was used to calculate the odds ratio (OR), while 
accounting for potential confounders, and the robustness of the results were 
evaluated in subgroup analyses. Among the 15,047 patients included in this 
study, the average age was 65.9 ± 16.0 years, 42.5% were female, 66.1% were 
Caucasian, and the 28-day mortality rate was 17.9% (2686/15,047). Multiple 
logistic regression analysis revealed the 28-day mortality in every increase of 
AG (per SD mEq/L), there is an associated 1.2 times (OR 1.2, 95% CI 1.12-1.29, 
P < .001) increase. Increased 28-day mortality (OR 1.53, 95% confidence interval 
1.29-1.81, P < .001) in the group with the AG (15-18 mEq/L), and (OR 1.69, 95% 
confidence interval 1.4-2.04, P < .001) in the group with the highest AG (≥18 
mEq/L), AG (<12 mEq/L) as a reference group, in the fully adjusted model. In 
adult patients with sepsis, the early AG at the time of ICU admission is an 
independent risk factor for prognosis.

OBJECTIVE: Unlocking the data contained within both structured and unstructured 
components of electronic health records (EHRs) has the potential to provide a 
step change in data available for secondary research use, generation of 
actionable medical insights, hospital management, and trial recruitment. To 
achieve this, we implemented SemEHR, an open source semantic search and 
analytics tool for EHRs.
METHODS: SemEHR implements a generic information extraction (IE) and retrieval 
infrastructure by identifying contextualized mentions of a wide range of 
biomedical concepts within EHRs. Natural language processing annotations are 
further assembled at the patient level and extended with EHR-specific knowledge 
to generate a timeline for each patient. The semantic data are serviced via 
ontology-based search and analytics interfaces.
RESULTS: SemEHR has been deployed at a number of UK hospitals, including the 
Clinical Record Interactive Search, an anonymized replica of the EHR of the UK 
South London and Maudsley National Health Service Foundation Trust, one of 
Europe's largest providers of mental health services. In 2 Clinical Record 
Interactive Search-based studies, SemEHR achieved 93% (hepatitis C) and 99% 
(HIV) F-measure results in identifying true positive patients. At King's College 
Hospital in London, as part of the CogStack program (github.com/cogstack), 
SemEHR is being used to recruit patients into the UK Department of Health 
100 000 Genomes Project (genomicsengland.co.uk). The validation study suggests 
that the tool can validate previously recruited cases and is very fast at 
searching phenotypes; time for recruitment criteria checking was reduced from 
days to minutes. Validated on open intensive care EHR data, Medical Information 
Mart for Intensive Care III, the vital signs extracted by SemEHR can achieve 
around 97% accuracy.
CONCLUSION: Results from the multiple case studies demonstrate SemEHR's 
efficiency: weeks or months of work can be done within hours or minutes in some 
cases. SemEHR provides a more comprehensive view of patients, bringing in more 
and unexpected insight compared to study-oriented bespoke IE systems. SemEHR is 
open source, available at https://github.com/CogStack/SemEHR.

OBJECTIVE: Acute kidney injury (AKI) is a clinical syndrome that occurs as a 
result of a dramatic decline in kidney function caused by a variety of 
etiological factors. Its main biomarkers, serum creatinine and urine output, are 
not effective in diagnosing early AKI. For this reason, this study provides 
insight into this syndrome by exploring the comorbidities of AKI, which may 
facilitate the early diagnosis of AKI. In addition, organ crosstalk in AKI was 
systematically explored based on comorbidities to obtain clinically reliable 
results.
METHODS: We collected data from the Medical Information Mart for Intensive 
Care-IV database on patients aged [Formula: see text] 18 years in intensive care 
units (ICU) who were diagnosed with AKI using the criteria proposed by Kidney 
Disease: Improving Global Outcomes. The Apriori algorithm was used to mine 
association rules on the diagnoses of 55,486 AKI and non-AKI patients in the 
ICU. The comorbidities of AKI mined were validated through the Electronic 
Intensive Care Unit database, the Colombian Open Health Database, and medical 
literature, after which comorbidity results were visualized using a disease 
network. Finally, organ diseases were identified and classified from 
comorbidities to investigate renal crosstalk with other distant organs in AKI.
RESULTS: We found 579 AKI comorbidities, and the main ones were disorders of 
lipoprotein metabolism, essential hypertension, and disorders of fluid, 
electrolyte, and acid-base balance. Of the 579 comorbidities, 554 were 
verifiable and 25 were new and not previously reported. In addition, crosstalk 
between the kidneys and distant non-renal organs including the liver, heart, 
brain, lungs, and gut was observed in AKI with the strongest heart-kidney 
crosstalk, followed by lung-kidney crosstalk.
CONCLUSION: The comorbidities mined in this study using association rules are 
scientific and may be used for the early diagnosis of AKI and the construction 
of AKI predictive models. Furthermore, the organ crosstalk results obtained 
through comorbidities may provide supporting information for the management of 
short- and long-term treatment practices for organ dysfunction.

Elevated lactate levels are common in sepsis patients. This study aimed to 
assess the effect of dynamic changes in lactate levels within the first 24 hours 
following admission on patient prognosis. We extracted data from the Medical 
Information Mart for Intensive Care (MIMIC)-IV database and classified patients 
using latent class growth analysis (LCGA). This analysis classified sepsis 
patients into different groups based on dynamic changes in lactate levels during 
the initial 24 hours post-admission, dividing this time frame into four periods 
(0-3 h, 3-6 h, 6-12 h, and 12-24 h). The highest lactate level recorded in each 
period was then used for patient classification. We subsequently compared the 
baseline characteristics and outcomes between these different groups. Our study 
encompassed 7,830 patients, whom LCGA successfully divided into two classes: 
class 1 (steady lactate class) and class 2 (increasing lactate class). Class 2 
demonstrated a worse clinical status at baseline, as indicated by vital signs, 
disease severity scores, and laboratory results. Importantly, class 2 also had a 
significantly higher 28-day mortality rate than class 1 (55.6% vs 13.5%, P < 
0.001). In conclusion, LCGA effectively categorized sepsis patients into two 
distinct groups based on their dynamic changes in lactate levels during the 
first 24 hours post-admission. This methodology has potential utility in 
clinical practice for managing sepsis patients.

BACKGROUND: Alactic base excess (ABE) is a novel biomarker to evaluate the renal 
capability of handling acid-base disturbances, which has been found to be 
associated with adverse prognosis of sepsis and shock patients. This study aimed 
to evaluate the association between ABE and the risk of in-hospital mortality in 
patients with acute myocardial infarction (AMI).
METHODS: This retrospective cohort study collected AMI patients' clinical data 
from the Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care (MIMIC)-IV database. The 
outcome was in-hospital mortality after intensive care unit (ICU) admission. 
Univariate and multivariate Cox proportional hazards models were performed to 
assess the association of ABE with in-hospital mortality in AMI patients, with 
hazard ratios (HRs) and 95% confidence intervals (CI). To further explore the 
association, subgroup analyses were performed based on age, AKI, eGFR, sepsis, 
and AMI subtypes.
RESULTS: Of the total 2779 AMI patients, 502 died in hospital. Negative ABE 
(HR = 1.26, 95%CI: 1.02-1.56) (neutral ABE as reference) was associated with a 
higher risk of in-hospital mortality in AMI patients, but not in positive ABE 
(P = 0.378). Subgroup analyses showed that negative ABE was significantly 
associated with a higher risk of in-hospital mortality in AMI patients aged>65 
years (HR = 1.46, 95%CI: 1.13-1.89), with eGFR<60 (HR = 1.35, 95%CI: 1.05-1.74), 
with AKI (HR = 1.32, 95%CI: 1.06-1.64), with ST-segment elevation acute 
myocardial infarction (STEMI) subtype (HR = 1.79, 95%CI: 1.18-2.72), and without 
sepsis (HR = 1.29, 95%CI: 1.01-1.64).
CONCLUSION: Negative ABE was significantly associated with in-hospital mortality 
in patients with AMI.

INTRODUCTION: Comorbid conditions associated with Alzheimer's disease (AD) are 
poorly understood regarding timing and potential impact on disease onset and 
progression.
METHODS: Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care-IV electronic health 
records from 2008 to 2019 were examined. The study identified 2527 AD patients 
(34.9% male, mean age 80.27 years) among 299,712 patients. We examined the 
timing of 12 cardiovascular and metabolic diseases relative to AD diagnosis. 
Data from the National Alzheimer's Coordinating Center validated the findings.
RESULTS: Hypertension was the most common comorbidity, diagnosed 1.09 years 
before AD. Depression was the only comorbidity diagnosed after AD start, 0.16 
years on average. AD patients had greater rates of hypertension, 
hypercholesterolemia, and depression compared to the general population.
DISCUSSION: The findings emphasize early detection and therapy of AD-related 
comorbidities, notably cardiovascular and metabolic diseases. The temporal link 
between these diseases and AD suggests opportunities for preventive strategies 
and improved care pathways.
HIGHLIGHTS: Temporal analysis of comorbidities: The study reveals hypertension 
and hyperlipidemia as leading precursors to AD, typically diagnosed 1 to 1.3 
years prior to AD onset, while depression emerges predominantly after diagnosis. 
Unique data integration: Large-scale datasets from MIMIC-IV (n = 299,712) and 
NACC (n = 51,836) were leveraged to identify chronological patterns in 12 key 
comorbid conditions relative to AD diagnosis. Sex- and age-specific insights: AD 
prevalence peaks at 80 to 86 years, with females exhibiting higher rates of LOAD 
compared to males. Depression as a post-diagnostic marker: Unlike other 
comorbidities, depression's post-diagnostic mean onset (0.16 years after AD 
diagnosis) highlights the need for targeted mental health interventions in AD 
patients. Implications for early detection: Findings suggest that managing 
hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and other modifiable conditions in midlife may 
delay or reduce the risk of AD development. Comorbidity variability across 
cohorts: Hypertension and hypercholesterolemia showed significantly higher 
prevalence in the NACC cohort compared to MIMIC-IV, reflecting potential 
dataset-specific biases or regional healthcare differences. Future research 
directions: Advocates for longitudinal, multiethnic, and global studies to 
refine early diagnostic criteria and explore preventive strategies tailored to 
comorbid conditions.

BACKGROUND: Acute hypotensive episodes (AHE), defined as a drop in the mean 
arterial pressure (MAP) <65 mm Hg lasting at least 5 consecutive minutes, are 
among the most critical events in the intensive care unit (ICU). They are known 
to be associated with adverse outcome in critically ill patients. AHE prediction 
is of prime interest because it could allow for treatment adjustment to predict 
or shorten AHE.
METHODS: The Super Learner (SL) algorithm is an ensemble machine-learning 
algorithm that we specifically trained to predict an AHE 10 minutes in advance. 
Potential predictors included age, sex, type of care unit, severity scores, and 
time-evolving characteristics such as mechanical ventilation, vasopressors, or 
sedation medication as well as features extracted from physiological signals: 
heart rate, pulse oximetry, and arterial blood pressure. The algorithm was 
trained on the Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care dataset (MIMIC II) 
database. Internal validation was based on the area under the receiver operating 
characteristic curve (AUROC) and the Brier score (BS). External validation was 
performed using an external dataset from Lariboisière hospital, Paris, France.
RESULTS: Among 1151 patients included, 826 (72%) patients had at least 1 AHE 
during their ICU stay. Using 1 single random period per patient, the SL 
algorithm with Haar wavelets transform preprocessing was associated with an 
AUROC of 0.929 (95% confidence interval [CI], 0.899-0.958) and a BS of 0.08. 
Using all available periods for each patient, SL with Haar wavelets transform 
preprocessing was associated with an AUROC of 0.890 (95% CI, 0.886-0.895) and a 
BS of 0.11. In the external validation cohort, the AUROC reached 0.884 (95% CI, 
0.775-0.993) with 1 random period per patient and 0.889 (0.768-1) with all 
available periods and BSs <0.1.
CONCLUSIONS: The SL algorithm exhibits good performance for the prediction of an 
AHE 10 minutes ahead of time. It allows an efficient, robust, and rapid 
evaluation of the risk of hypotension that opens the way to routine use.

BACKGROUND: Predicting long-term survival in intensive care unit patients with 
intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH) is crucial. This study aimed to develop a 
platelet-to-white blood cell ratio (PWR) incorporated nomogram for long-term 
survival prediction.
METHODS: A retrospective analysis was conducted on 1,728 ICH patients in the 
MIMIC-IV 2.2 database. The independent prognostic value of PWR for 1-year 
mortality was assessed. A nomogram was developed using LASSO and Cox regression 
to predict 1-year survival, incorporating PWR and other factors. The performance 
of the nomogram was evaluated through calibration curves, area under the curve, 
Delong test, net reclassification index, integrated discrimination improvement, 
and decision curve analysis.
RESULTS: The nomogram, which included age, weight, Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) 
score, mechanical ventilation, glucose, red blood cell (RBC) count, blood urea 
nitrogen (BUN), and PWR, showed good predictive performance for 1-year survival. 
The C-index was 0.736 (95% CI = 0.716-0.756) for the training set and 0.766 (95% 
CI = 0.735-0.797) for the testing set. Higher age and ventilation increased 
mortality risk, while higher weight, GCS score, RBC count, and PWR decreased 
risk. The nomogram outperformed conventional scores.
CONCLUSIONS: A nomogram incorporating PWR as a prognostic factor accurately 
predicts long-term survival in ICH patients. However, validation in large-scale 
multicenter studies and further exploration of biomarkers are needed.

BACKGROUND: The incidence, mortality, and readmission rates for acute heart 
failure (AHF) are high, and the in-hospital mortality for AHF patients in the 
intensive care unit (ICU) is higher. However, there is currently no method to 
accurately predict the mortality of AHF patients.
METHODS: The Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care Ⅳ (MIMIC-Ⅳ) database 
was used to perform a retrospective study. Patients meeting the inclusion 
criteria were identified from the MIMIC-Ⅳ database and randomly divided into a 
training set (n = 3,580, 70%) and a validation set (n = 1,534, 30%). The 
variates collected include demographic data, vital signs, comorbidities, 
laboratory test results, and treatment information within 24 hours of ICU 
admission. By using the least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) 
regression model in the training set, variates that affect the in-hospital 
mortality of AHF patients were screened. Subsequently, in the training set, five 
common machine learning (ML) algorithms were applied to construct models using 
variates selected by LASSO to predict the in-hospital mortality of AHF patients. 
The predictive ability of the models was evaluated for sensitivity, specificity, 
accuracy, the area under the curve of receiver operating characteristics, and 
clinical net benefit in the validation set. To obtain a model with the best 
predictive ability, the predictive ability of common scoring systems was 
compared with the best ML model.
RESULTS: Among the 5,114 patients, in-hospital mortality was 12.5%. Comparing 
the area under the curve, the XGBoost model had the best predictive ability 
among all ML models, and the XGBoost model was chosen as the final model for its 
higher net benefit. Its predictive ability was superior to common scoring 
systems.
CONCLUSIONS: The XGBoost model can effectively predict the in-hospital mortality 
of AHF patients admitted to the ICU, which may assist clinicians in precise 
management and early intervention for patients with AHF to reduce mortality.

BACKGROUND AND AIM: Acute pancreatitis (AP) is potentially fatal. Therefore, 
early identification of patients at a high mortality risk and timely 
intervention are essential. This study aimed to establish an explainable 
machine-learning model for predicting in-hospital mortality of intensive care 
unit (ICU) patients with AP.
METHODS: Data on patients with AP, including demographics, vital signs, 
laboratory tests, comorbidities, treatment, complication, and severity scores, 
were extracted from the Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care IV 
(MIMIC-IV) and the eICU collaborative research database (eICU-CRD). Based on the 
data from MIMIC-IV, we used the least absolute shrinkage and selection operator 
algorithm to select variables and then established 9 machine-learning models and 
screened the optimal model. Data from the eICU-CRD were used for external 
validation. The area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC), 
sensitivity, specificity, accuracy, decision curve, and calibration plots were 
used to assess the models' efficacy. Shapley's additive explanation values were 
used to explain the model.
RESULTS: Gaussian naive Bayes (GNB) model had the best performance on the data 
from MIMIC-IV, with an AUC, accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity of 0.840, 
0.787, 0.839, and 0.792, respectively. The GNB model also performed well on the 
data from the eICU-CRD, with an AUC, accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity of 
0.862, 0.833, 0.848, and 0.763, respectively. According to Shapley's additive 
explanation values, the top 4 predictive factors were maximum red cell 
distribution width, minimum saturation of blood oxygen, maximum blood urea 
nitrogen, and the Sequential Organ Failure Assessment score.
CONCLUSION: The GNB model demonstrated excellent performance and 
generalizability in predicting mortality in ICU patients with AP. Therefore, it 
can identify patients at a high mortality risk.

OBJECTIVES: Sepsis is an evolving process and proposed subtypes may change over 
time. We hypothesized that previously established sepsis subtypes are dynamic, 
prognostic of outcome, and trajectories are associated with host response 
alterations.
DESIGN: A secondary analysis of two observational critically ill sepsis cohorts: 
the Molecular diAgnosis and Risk stratification of Sepsis (MARS) and the Medical 
Information Mart for Intensive Care-IV (MIMIC-IV).
SETTING: ICUs in the Netherlands and United States between 2011-2014 and 
2008-2019, respectively.
PARTICIPANTS: Patient admission fulfilling the Sepsis-3 criteria upon ICU 
admission adjudicated to one of four previously identified subtypes, comprising 
2,416 admissions in MARS and 10,745 in MIMIC-IV.
MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Subtype stability and the changes per subtype on 
days 2, 4 and 7 of ICU admission were assessed. Next, the associated between 
change in clinical subtype and outcome and host response alterations.
RESULTS: In MARS, upon ICU admission, 6% (n = 150) of the patient admissions 
were α-type, 3% (n = 70) β-type, 55% (n = 1317) γ-type, and 36% (n = 879) 
δ-type; in MIMIC-IV, this was α = 22% (n = 2398), β = 22% (n = 2365), γ = 31% (n 
= 3296), and δ = 25% (2686). Overall, prevalence of subtypes was stable over 
days 2, 4, and 7. However, 28-56% (MARS/MIMIC-IV) changed from α on ICU 
admission to any of the other subtypes on day 2, 33-71% from β, 57-32% from γ, 
and 50-48% from δ. On day 4, overall subtype persistence was 33-36%. γ or δ 
admissions remaining in, or transitioning to, subtype γ on days 2, 4, and 7 
exhibited lower mortality rates compared with those remaining in, or 
transitioning to, subtype δ. Longitudinal host response biomarkers reflecting 
inflammation, coagulation, and endothelial dysfunction were most altered in the 
δ-δ group, followed by the γ-δ group, independent of the day or biomarker 
domain.
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: In two large cohorts, subtype change to δ was 
associated with worse clinical outcome and more aberrant biomarkers reflecting 
inflammation, coagulation, and endothelial dysfunction. These findings 
underscore the importance of monitoring sepsis subtypes and their linked host 
responses for improved prognostication and personalized treatment strategies.

OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the impact of pre-intensive care unit admission (pre-ICU) 
statin use on all-cause in-hospital mortality and ICU length of stay (LOS).
DESIGN: Retrospective cohort study.
SETTING: Adult ICUs at tertiary hospitals.
PATIENTS: Adult critically ill patients diagnosed with sepsis admitted to the 
ICUs.
INTERVENTION: The exposure was pre-ICU statin prescription (statin users); 
unexposed represented absence of pre-ICU prescription (non-users).
MEASUREMENT AND MAIN RESULTS: We used the 2001-2012 Medical Information Mart for 
Intensive Care-III (MIMIC-III) database to determine average treatment effect 
(ATE) of pre-ICU statin use on 30-day ICU mortality, ICU LOS, and 30-day 
in-hospital mortality using the Augmented Inverse Propensity Weighted technique 
(AIPW), after adjusting for confounding factors (age, race, health insurance, 
corticosteroids use, vital signs, laboratory tests, and Sequential Organ Failure 
Assessment score (SOFA). We measured 30-day ICU mortality as deaths within 
30 days of admission to the ICU, and ICU LOS was measured in fractional days. A 
30-day in-hospital mortality was measured as death within 30 days of hospital 
admission. A total of 8200 patients with sepsis were identified; 19.8% (1623) 
were statin users, and 80.2% (6577) were non-users. Most were Caucasian, aged 
80 years and above, and male. After adjusting for confounding factors, pre-ICU 
statin use decreased 30-day ICU mortality (ATE, -0.026; 95% confidence interval 
[CI], -0.048 to -0.009); ICU LOS (ATE, -0.369; 95% Cl, -0.849 to -0.096); and 
30-day in-hospital mortality (ATE, -0.039; 95% CI, -0.084 to -0.026) on average 
compared with non-statin use, respectively. In a stratified analysis, the result 
for ICU LOS (ATE, -0.526; 95% CI, -0.879 to -0.241) and 30-day in-hospital 
mortality (ATE, -0.023; 95% CI, -0.048 to -0.002) was consistent among patients 
admitted to the medical ICU.
CONCLUSIONS: Among patients with sepsis admitted to the medical ICU, pre-ICU 
statin use is causally associated with a decrease in 30-day ICU mortality, ICU 
LOS, and 30-day in-hospital mortality compared to non-use. This study adds to 
the totality of evidence on the pleiotropic effect of statin use in patients 
with sepsis.

Sepsis is a major health concern with global estimates of 31.5 million cases per 
year. Case fatality rates are still unacceptably high, and early detection and 
treatment is vital since it significantly reduces mortality rates for this 
condition. Appropriately designed automated detection tools have the potential 
to reduce the morbidity and mortality of sepsis by providing early and accurate 
identification of patients who are at risk of developing sepsis. In this paper, 
we present "LiSep LSTM"; a Long Short-Term Memory neural network designed for 
early identification of septic shock. LSTM networks are typically well-suited 
for detecting long-term dependencies in time series data. LiSep LSTM was 
developed using the machine learning framework Keras with a Google TensorFlow 
back end. The model was trained with data from the Medical Information Mart for 
Intensive Care database which contains vital signs, laboratory data, and journal 
entries from approximately 59,000 ICU patients. We show that LiSep LSTM can 
outperform a less complex model, using the same features and targets, with an 
AUROC 0.8306 (95% confidence interval: 0.8236, 0.8376) and median offsets 
between prediction and septic shock onset up to 40 hours (interquartile range, 
20 to 135 hours). Moreover, we discuss how our classifier performs at specific 
offsets before septic shock onset, and compare it with five state-of-the-art 
machine learning algorithms for early detection of sepsis.

The purpose of this retrospective study was to assess whether mortality 
following a hip fracture can be predicted by a machine learning model trained on 
basic blood and lab test data as well as basic demographic data. Additionally, 
the purpose was to identify the key variables most associated with 1-, 5-, and 
10-year mortality and investigate their clinical significance. Input data 
included 3751 hip fracture patient records sourced from the Medical Information 
Mart for Intensive Care IV database, which provided records from in-hospital 
database systems at the Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center. The 1-year 
mortality rate for all patients studied was 21% and for those aged 80+ was 29%. 
We assessed 10 different machine learning classification models, finding 
LightGBM to have the strongest 1-year mortality prediction performance, with 
accuracy of 81%, AUC of 0.79, sensitivity of 0.34, and specificity of 0.98 on 
the test set. The strongest-weighted features of the 1-year model included age, 
glucose, red blood cell distribution width, mean corpuscular hemoglobin 
concentration, white blood cells, urea nitrogen, prothrombin time, platelet 
count, calcium levels, and partial thromboplastin time. Most of these were also 
in the top 10 features of the LightGBM 5- and 10-year prediction models trained. 
Testing for these high-ranking biomarkers in new hip fracture patients can aid 
clinicians in assessing the likelihood of poor outcomes for hip fracture 
patients, and additional research can use these biomarkers to develop a 
mortality risk score.

The purpose of this study was to investigate the relationship between glucose to 
lymphocyte ratio (GLR) and the outcome of acute exacerbation chronic obstructive 
pulmonary disease (AECOPD) patients admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU). 
This study included 3573 patients from the eICU Collaborative Research Database 
(eICU-CRD) and 926 AECOPD patients admitted to ICU from the Medical Information 
Mart for Intensive Care-IV (MIMIC-IV) database. The optimal cutoff value for GLR 
was 5.6. Kaplan-Meier analysis demonstrated that patients in lower GLR (< 5.6) 
group showed a better overall survival than patients in higher GLR (≥ 5.6) group 
in all sets. Multivariate Cox regression analysis demonstrated that age, 
Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (SOFA) score, SpO2, albumin and GLR are 
independent predictors of poor overall survival in the training cohort and were 
incorporated into the nomogram for in-hospital mortality as independent factors. 
The nomogram exhibited excellent discrimination with C-indexes in training 
cohort, internal validation and external validation cohort were (0.801, 95%CI: 
0.769-0.863), (0.805, 95%CI: 0.759-0.851) and (0.811, 95%CI: 0.772-0.850), 
respectively. The calibration plot indicated an adequate fit of the nomogram for 
predicting the risk of in-hospital mortality in all sets. Moreover, the ROC 
analyses demonstrated that the discrimination abilities of GLR were better than 
other blood-based inflammatory biomarkers. As an easily available biomarker, GLR 
can independently predict the in-hospital mortality in AECOPD patients admitted 
to ICU. The nomogram combining GLR with other significant indicators exhibited 
excellence predictive performance for in-hospital mortality.

BACKGROUND: Sepsis is a life-threatening condition characterized by a 
dysregulated host immune response to infection. Currently, stress hyperglycemia 
is frequently associated with an unfavorable prognosis in cardiovascular and 
cerebrovascular disease. During sepsis, the progression of the immune response 
and inflammation often leads to aberrant metabolic indicators. However, the 
association between the stress-induced hyperglycemia ratio (SHR) and sepsis in 
patients admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) remains uncertain.
OBJECTIVES: This study aimed to explore the potential correlation between SHR 
and sepsis.
MATERIAL AND METHODS: In this retrospective cohort study, data were obtained 
from the Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care-IV (MIMIC-IV) database. 
Patients with recorded glucose and glycosylated HbA1c levels within 24-h ICU 
admission were identified. The endpoints of the follow-up period were the 
occurrence of sepsis during ICU stay or ICU discharge. After adjustment for 
factors including demographics, vital signs and biochemical indicators, the 
univariate and multivariate logistic regression model was employed to examine 
the relationship between SHR, baseline blood glucose levels and the risk of 
sepsis. The associations were further explored in subgroups based on age, gender 
and presence/absence of type 2 diabetes.
RESULTS: Of the total 2,161 patients, with the average age of 64.96 ±16.84 
years, 205 (9.49%) had sepsis. After adjustment or confounders, high SHR levels 
were associated with the risk of sepsis odds ratio (OR) = 1.53, 95% confidence 
interval (95% CI): 1.07-2.17). Similar results were found in patients aged ≥65 
years (OR = 1.91, 95% CI: 1.16-3.17), in men (OR = 1.64, 95% CI: 1.02-2.63) and 
patients without type 2 diabetes history (OR = 1.58, 95% CI: 1.01-2.48). The 
baseline blood glucose level did not exhibit a significant association with the 
risk of sepsis.
CONCLUSIONS: Elevated SHR levels were correlated with sepsis. Bedside monitoring 
of SHR may be a valuable tool for clinicians to identify patients at high risk 
of sepsis, and be beneficial to promptly implement clinical interventions.

BACKGROUND: This study aimed to evaluate the role of platelet count (PLT) in the 
prognosis of patients with acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS).
METHODS: The data were extracted from the Medical Information Mart for Intensive 
Care database (version 2.2). Patients diagnosed with ARDS according to criteria 
from Berlin Definition and had the platelet count (PLT) measured within the 
first day after intensive care unit admission were analyzed. Based on PLT, ARDS 
patients were divided into four groups: PLT ≤ 100 × 109/L, PLT 101-200 × 109/L, 
PLT 201-300 × 109/L, and PLT > 300 × 109/L. The primary outcome was 28-day 
mortality. Survival probabilities were analyzed using Kaplan-Meier. Furthermore, 
the association between PLT and mortality in ARDS patients was assessed using a 
univariate and multivariable Cox proportional hazards model.
RESULTS: Overall, the final analysis included 3,207 eligible participants with 
ARDS. According to the Kaplan-Meier curves for 28-day mortality of PLT, 
PLT ≤ 100 × 109/L was associated with a higher incidence of mortality 
(P = 0.001), the same trends were observed in the 60-day (P = 0.001) and 90-day 
mortality (P = 0.001). In the multivariate model adjusted for the potential 
factors, the adjusted hazard ratio at PLT 101-200 × 109/L group, PLT 
201-300 × 109/L, and PLT > 300 × 109/L was 0.681 [95% confidence interval (CI): 
0.576-0.805, P < 0.001], 0.733 (95% CI: 0.604-0.889, P = 0.002), and 0.787 (95% 
CI: 0.624-0.994, P = 0.044) compared to the reference group (PLT ≤ 100 × 109/L), 
respectively. Similar relationships between the PLT ≤ 100 × 109/L group and 
28-day mortality were obtained in most subgroups.
CONCLUSION: PLT appeared to be an independent predictor of mortality in 
critically ill patients with ARDS.

OBJECTIVE: The Emergency Severity Index (ESI) is the most commonly used system 
in over 70% of all U.S. emergency departments (ED) that uses predicted resource 
utilization as a means to triage [1], Mistriage, which includes both undertriage 
and overtriage has been a persistent issue, affecting 32.2% of total ED visits 
[2]. Our goal is to develop a machine learning framework that predicts patients' 
resource needs, thereby improving resource allocation during triage.
METHODS: This retrospective study analyzed ED visits from the Medical 
Information Mart for Intensive Care IV, dividing the data into training (80%) 
and testing (20%) cohorts. We utilized data available during triage, including 
patient vital signs, age, gender, mode of arrival, medication history, and chief 
complaint. Azure AutoML was used to create different machine learning models 
trained to predict the 144 target columns including laboratory panels and 
imaging modalities as well as medications required during patients' ED visits. 
The 144 models' performance was evaluated using the area under the receiver 
operating characteristic curve (AUROC), F1 score, accuracy, precision and 
recall.
RESULTS: A total of 391,472 ED visits were analyzed. 144 Voting ensemble models 
were created for each target. All frameworks achieved on average an AUC score of 
0.82 and accuracy of 0.76. We gathered the feature importance for each target 
and observed that 'chief complaint', among others, had a high aggregate feature 
importance across different targets.
CONCLUSION: This study shows the high accuracy in predicting resource needs for 
patients in the ED using a machine learning model. This can greatly improve 
patient flow and resource allocation in already resource limited emergency 
departments.

BACKGROUND: Cardiac arrest (CA) is the leading cause of death in critically ill 
patients. Clinical research has shown that early identification of CA reduces 
mortality. Algorithms capable of predicting CA with high sensitivity have been 
developed using multivariate time series data. However, these algorithms suffer 
from a high rate of false alarms, and their results are not clinically 
interpretable.
OBJECTIVE: We propose an ensemble approach using multiresolution statistical 
features and cosine similarity-based features for the timely prediction of CA. 
Furthermore, this approach provides clinically interpretable results that can be 
adopted by clinicians.
METHODS: Patients were retrospectively analyzed using data from the Medical 
Information Mart for Intensive Care-IV database and the eICU Collaborative 
Research Database. Based on the multivariate vital signs of a 24-hour time 
window for adults diagnosed with heart failure, we extracted multiresolution 
statistical and cosine similarity-based features. These features were used to 
construct and develop gradient boosting decision trees. Therefore, we adopted 
cost-sensitive learning as a solution. Then, 10-fold cross-validation was 
performed to check the consistency of the model performance, and the Shapley 
additive explanation algorithm was used to capture the overall interpretability 
of the proposed model. Next, external validation using the eICU Collaborative 
Research Database was performed to check the generalization ability.
RESULTS: The proposed method yielded an overall area under the receiver 
operating characteristic curve (AUROC) of 0.86 and area under the 
precision-recall curve (AUPRC) of 0.58. In terms of the timely prediction of CA, 
the proposed model achieved an AUROC above 0.80 for predicting CA events up to 6 
hours in advance. The proposed method simultaneously improved precision and 
sensitivity to increase the AUPRC, which reduced the number of false alarms 
while maintaining high sensitivity. This result indicates that the predictive 
performance of the proposed model is superior to the performances of the models 
reported in previous studies. Next, we demonstrated the effect of feature 
importance on the clinical interpretability of the proposed method and inferred 
the effect between the non-CA and CA groups. Finally, external validation was 
performed using the eICU Collaborative Research Database, and an AUROC of 0.74 
and AUPRC of 0.44 were obtained in a general intensive care unit population.
CONCLUSIONS: The proposed framework can provide clinicians with more accurate CA 
prediction results and reduce false alarm rates through internal and external 
validation. In addition, clinically interpretable prediction results can 
facilitate clinician understanding. Furthermore, the similarity of vital sign 
changes can provide insights into temporal pattern changes in CA prediction in 
patients with heart failure-related diagnoses. Therefore, our system is 
sufficiently feasible for routine clinical use. In addition, regarding the 
proposed CA prediction system, a clinically mature application has been 
developed and verified in the future digital health field.

BACKGROUND: The association between the hemoglobin-to-red cell distribution 
width ratio (HRR) and mortality in critically ill patients with heart failure 
(HF) and acute kidney injury (AKI) remains uncertain. This research focuses on 
exploring the association between HRR and both short-term and long-term 
all-cause mortality in these patients.
METHODS: Participants were selected from the Medical Information Mart for 
Intensive Care IV (MIMIC-IV) database and categorized into tertiles based on HRR 
values. The primary endpoint was 28-days ICU all-cause mortality. Secondary 
endpoints included 28-days hospital and 90-days hospital all-cause mortality. 
Cox proportional hazards models and restricted cubic splines were used to 
analyze the association between HRR and mortality in patients with HF and AKI. 
Kaplan-Meier survival analysis estimated endpoint differences across tertiles.
RESULTS: A total of 7561 patients were included, with 55.5% being male (n=4199). 
Cox proportional hazards analysis showed a significant link between HRR and both 
short-term and long-term mortality in critically ill patients with HF and AKI. 
This association remained significant after adjusting for confounders. The 
restricted cubic splines model demonstrated a linear relationship between a 
higher HRR index and a reduced mortality risk. Kaplan-Meier survival analysis 
revealed significant differences in short-term and long-term mortality among the 
tertile groups.
CONCLUSION: The study results show a strong association between lower HRR and 
increased short-term and long-term mortality in critically ill patients with 
heart failure and AKI. HRR proves to be a valuable and cost-effective marker for 
identifying high-risk patients.

Low blood glucose levels and high urea nitrogen levels affect patient prognosis, 
but few studies have investigated whether the blood urea nitrogen to glucose 
(BGR) ratio predicts the risk of death.This retrospective research examined the 
connection between the BGR and 365-day mortality in patients with chronic kidney 
disease (CKD) stages 1-4 admitted to an intensive care unit (ICU). The study 
utilized data from 6,380 patients in the Medical Information Mart for Intensive 
Care IV version 2.2 (MIMIC-IV v2.2), taking into account confounding factors 
such as demographics, vital signs, laboratory indicators, and comorbidities. The 
study employed both univariate and multivariate Cox regression analyses 
stratified by BGR quartiles. Additionally, restricted cubic spline regression 
and inflection point analysis were used to explore the linear relationship 
between BGR and 365-day mortality, while Kaplan-Meier curve analysis was used to 
observe mortality changes under different BGR stratifications. Subgroup and 
mediating effect analyses were performed to evaluate the robustness of BGR's 
effect on 365-day mortality. The study found a cumulative 365-day mortality rate 
of 34.2% among CKD stages 1-4 patients, with a 2.43-fold increase in the risk of 
death associated with BGR and at least a 44% increase in the risk of death for 
each unit increase in BGR (P = 0.022). A significant nonlinear relationship was 
identified, showing a stepwise change in the risk of death with a marked 
increase in the slope of the curve for BGR values below 0.52 and above 0.9 
(P < 0.001). Subgroup analyses indicated interactions between BGR and factors 
such as age, sepsis, first-day antibiotic use, and cerebrovascular disease 
(P < 0.05). In conclusion, this study confirms that BGR is a significant and 
stable predictor of 1-year mortality risk in patients with CKD stages 1-4. 
Interventions aimed at timely adjustment, correction of metabolic imbalances, 
reduction of inflammation, and management of BGR levels are beneficial for 
reducing mortality in this patient population.

OBJECTIVE: To explore the risk factors of severe acute kidney injury (AKI) in 
septic patients, and to establish an hour-specific prediction model.
METHODS: Based on the information of septic patients in the Medical Information 
Mart for Intensive Care- IV (MIMIC- IV) database, general information, 
comorbidities, vital signs, severity scoring system, laboratory indicators, 
invasive operations and medication use were recorded. The enrolled patients were 
randomized into a training set and a validation set according to a ratio of 7 : 
3. AKI was diagnosed according to the guidelines of Kidney Disease: Improving 
Global Outcome (KDIGO). Based on Lasso regression and Cox regression, the risk 
factors of severe AKI (AKI stage 2 and stage 3) in septic patients were analyzed 
and hour-specific prediction model were established. Consistency index 
(C-index), area under the receiver operator characteristic curve (AUC) and 
calibration curve were used to assess the predictive efficacy of the model.
RESULTS: A total of 20 551 septic patients were enrolled, including 14 385 
patients in the training set and 6 166 patients in the validation set. 
Multivariate Cox regression analysis showed that atrial fibrillation [hazard 
ratio (HR) = 1.266, 95% confidence interval (95%CI) was 1.150-1.393], heart 
failure (HR = 1.348, 95%CI was 1.217-1.493), respiratory failure (HR = 1.565, 
95%CI was 1.428-1.715), heart rate (HR = 1.004, 95%CI was 1.002-1.007), mean 
arterial pressure (HR = 1.245, 95%CI was 1.126-1.377), lactic acid (HR = 1.051, 
95%CI was 1.025-1.077), simplified acute physiology score II (SAPS II, HR = 
1.019, 95%CI was 1.016-1.023), serum creatinine (HR = 1.171, 95%CI was 
1.127-1.216), anion gap (HR = 1.024, 95%CI was 1.010-1.038), serum potassium (HR 
= 1.155, 95%CI was 1.079-1.236), white blood cell count (HR = 1.006, 95%CI was 
1.003-1.009) and furosemide use (HR = 0.414, 95%CI was 0.368-0.467) were 
independently associated with severe AKI in septic patients (all P < 0.01). The 
above predictors were applied to construct an hour-specific prediction model for 
the occurrence of severe AKI in septic patients. The C-index of the prediction 
model was 0.723 and 0.735 in the training and validation sets, respectively. The 
AUC for the occurrence of severe AKI at 12, 24, and 48 hours were 0.795 (95%CI 
was 0.782-0.808), 0.792 (95%CI was 0.780-0.805), and 0.775 (95%CI was 
0.762-0.788) in the training set, and the AUC were 0.803 (95%CI was 
0.784-0.823), 0.791 (95%CI was 0.772-0.810), and 0.773 (95%CI was 0.752-0.793) 
in the validation set, respectively. The calibration curves of the two cohorts 
were in good agreement.
CONCLUSIONS: The hour-specific prediction model effectively identifies high-risk 
septic patients for developing severe AKI within 48 hours, aiding clinicians in 
stratifying patients for early therapeutic interventions to improve outcomes.

OBJECTIVES: To evaluate the contribution of a preextubation chest X-ray (CXR) to 
identify the risk of extubation failure in mechanically ventilated patients.
DESIGN: Retrospective cohort study.
SETTINGS: ICUs in a tertiary center (the Medical Information Mart for Intensive 
Care IV database).
PATIENTS: Patients greater than or equal to 18 years old who were mechanically 
ventilated and extubated after a spontaneous breathing trial.
INTERVENTIONS: None.
MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Among 1,066 mechanically ventilated patients, 132 
patients (12%) experienced extubation failure, defined as reintubation or death 
within 48 hours of extubation. To predict extubation failure, we developed the 
following models based on deep learning (EfficientNet) and machine learning 
(LightGBM) with the training data: 1) model using only the rapid-shallow 
breathing index (RSBI), 2) model using RSBI and CXR, 3) model using all 
candidate clinical predictors (i.e., patient demographics, vital signs, 
laboratory values, and ventilator settings) other than CXR, and 4) model using 
all candidate clinical predictors with CXR. We compared the predictive abilities 
between models with the test data to investigate the predictive contribution of 
CXR. The predictive ability of the model using CXR as well as RSBI was not 
significantly higher than that of the model using only RSBI (c-statistics, 0.56 
vs 0.56; p = 0.95). The predictive ability of the model using clinical 
predictors with CXR was not significantly higher than that of the model using 
all clinical predictors other than CXR (c-statistics, 0.71 vs 0.70; p = 0.12). 
Based on SHapley Additive exPlanations values to interpret the model using all 
clinical predictors with CXR, CXR was less likely to contribute to the 
predictive ability than other predictors (e.g., duration of mechanical 
ventilation, inability to follow commands, and heart rate).
CONCLUSIONS: Adding CXR to a set of other clinical predictors in our prediction 
model did not significantly improve the predictive ability of extubation failure 
in mechanically ventilated patients.

BACKGROUND: Cirrhosis is a leading cause of global disease burden, with high 
mortality, particularly in critically ill patients. The blood urea nitrogen to 
creatinine ratio (BCR) is a straightforward biochemical indicator of renal 
excretory function and is linked to negative outcomes across different 
conditions. However, the relationship between BCR and mortality in critically 
ill patients with cirrhosis is unclear, The purpose of this study is to explore 
this question.
METHODS: A retrospective cohort study was performed utilizing the MIMIC-IV 
database. We divided BCR into quartiles and evaluated 180-day and 365-day 
mortality as the primary outcomes. Kaplan-Meier survival analysis and 
multivariate Cox regression modeling were used to assess the link between BCR 
and mortality. Linear relationships were further determined using restricted 
cubic spline (RCS) curves, and finally, subgroup analyses were also performed.
RESULTS: In our study of 2,816 critically ill cirrhotic patients, elevated BCR 
was significantly linked to higher mortality at both 180 and 365 days. The top 
BCR quartile showed a 45% higher risk of 180-day mortality (HR=1.45, 95% CI: 
1.21-1.73) and a 38% higher risk of 365-day mortality (HR=1.38, 95% CI: 
1.17-1.63) relative to the bottom quartile. RCS analysis demonstrated a notable 
linear correlation between BCR and mortality risk. Subgroup analyses indicated a 
stronger association between BCR and mortality among older patients.
CONCLUSION: In critically ill cirrhotic patients, elevated BCR values are 
strongly linked to increased mortality risk. Our research highlights BCR's 
potential as a prognostic marker for cirrhosis, especially in elderly patients.

Previous studies have shown that lactate/albumin ratio (LAR) can be used as a 
prognostic biomarker to independently predict the mortality of sepsis and severe 
heart failure. However, the role of LAR as an independent prognostic factor in 
all-cause mortality in patients with acute respiratory failure (ARF) remains to 
be clarified. Therefore, we retrospectively analyzed 2170 patients with ARF in 
Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care Database III from 2001 to 2012. By 
drawing the receiver operating characteristic curve, LAR shows a better 
predictive value in predicting the 30-day mortality of ARF patients (AUC: 
0.646), which is higher than that of albumin (AUC: 0.631) or lactate (AUC: 
0.616) alone, and even higher than SOFA score(AUC: 0.642). COX regression 
analysis and Kaplan-Meier curve objectively and intuitively show that high LAR 
is a risk factor for patients with ARF, which is positively correlated with 
all-cause mortality. As an easy-to-obtain and objective biomarker, LAR deserves 
further verification by multi-center prospective studies.

OBJECTIVE: Lung is often implicated in sepsis, resulting in acute respiratory 
distress syndrome (ARDS). The alveolar-arterial oxygen gradient [D(A-a)O2 ] 
reflects lung diffusing capacity, which is usually compromised in ARDS. But 
whether D(A-a)O2 impacts the prognosis of patients with sepsis remains to be 
explored. Our study aims to investigate the association between D(A-a)O2 and 
28-day mortality in patients with sepsis using a large sample, multicenter 
Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care (MIMIC)-IV database.
METHODS: We extracted a data of 35 010 patients with sepsis from the 
retrospective cohort MIMIC-IV database, by which the independent effects of 
D(A-a)O2 on 28-day death risk was investigated, with D(A-a)O2 as being the 
exposure variable and 28-day fatality being the outcome variable. Binary 
logistic regression and a two-piecewise linear model were employed to explore 
the relationship between D(A-a)O2 and the 28-day death risk after confounding 
factors were optimized including demographic indicators, Charlson comorbidity 
index (CCI), Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (SOFA) score, drug 
administration, and vital signs.
RESULTS: A total of 18 933 patients were finally included in our analysis. The 
patients' average age was 66.67 ± 16.01 years, and the mortality at 28 days was 
19.23% (3640/18933). Multivariate analysis demonstrated that each 10-mmHg rise 
of D(A-a)O2 was linked with a 3% increase in the probability of death at 28 days 
either in the unadjusted model or in adjustment for demographic variables (Odds 
ratio [OR]: 1.03, 95% CI: 1.02 to 1.03). But, each 10 mmHg increase in D(A-a)O2 
was associated with a 3% increase of death (OR: 1.03, 95% CI: 1.023 to 1.033) in 
the case of adjustment for all covariants. Through smoothed curve fitting and 
generalized summation models, we found that non-linear relationship existed 
between D(A-a)O2 and the death at 28-day, which demonstrated that D(A-a)O2 had 
no any impacts on the prognosis of patients with sepsis when D(A-a)O2 was less 
than or equal to 300 mmHg, but once D(A-a)O2 exceeded 300 mmHg, however, every 
10 mmHg elevation of D(A-a)O2 is accompanied by a 5% increase of the 28-day 
death (OR: 1.05; 95% CI:1.04 to 1.05, p < 0.0001).
CONCLUSION: Our findings suggests that D(A-a)O2 is a valuable indicator for the 
management of sepsis patient, and it is recommended that D(A-a)O2 be maintained 
less than 300 mmHg as far as possible during sepsis process.

BACKGROUND: Cardiogenic shock (CS) is a critical illness with a high mortality 
rate in clinical practice. Although some biomarkers have been found to be 
associated with mortality in patients suffering from CS in previous studies. The 
albumin-corrected anion gap (ACAG) has not been studied in depth. Our study 
aimed to explore the relationship between ACAG and mortality in patients with 
CS.
METHODS: All baseline data was extracted from Medical Information Mart for 
Intensive Care-IV version: 2.0 (MIMIC-IV). According to the prognosis at 30 days 
of follow-up, they were divided into survivors and non-survivors groups. The 
survival curves between the two groups were drawn using the Kaplan-Meier method 
and the log-rank test. Valid factors were selected using the least absolute 
shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) logistic analysis model. Analysis was 
performed to investigate the relationship between mortality and all enrolled 
patients using restricted cubic spline (RCS) and Cox proportional hazards 
models. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves were used to assess the 
predictive ability of ACAG. Evaluation of final result stability using 
sensitivity analysis.
RESULTS: 839 cases were selected to meet the inclusion criteria and categorized 
into survivors and non-survivors groups in the final analysis. The ACAG value 
measured for the first time at the time of admission was selected as the 
research object. Kaplan-Meier (K-M) survival curves showed that cumulative 30- 
and 90-day survival decreased progressively with elevated ACAG (p  <  0.001), 
and multifactorial Cox regression analyses showed ACAG to be an independent risk 
factor for increased 30- and 90-day mortality in patients suffering from CS (p 
 <  0.05). RCS curves revealed that all-cause mortality in this group of 
patients increased with increasing ACAG ( χ 2 = 5.830, p = 0.120). The ROC curve 
showed that the best cutoff value for ACAG for predicting 30-day mortality in 
patients with CS was 22.625, with a sensitivity of 44.0% and a specificity of 
74.7%. The relationship between ACAG and CS short-term mortality remained stable 
in all sensitivity analyses (All p  <  0.05).
CONCLUSIONS: The ACAG is an independent risk factor for 30- and 90-day mortality 
in CS patients and predicts poor clinical outcomes in CS patients. According to 
our study, elevated ACAG at admission, especially when ACAG  >  20 mmol/L, was 
an independent predictor of all-cause mortality in CS.

BACKGROUND: Anti-Embolism (AE) devices therapy is an additional antithrombotic 
treatment that is effective in many venous diseases, but the correlations 
between this medical compression therapy and cardiovascular arterial disease or 
comorbid diabetes mellitus (DM) are still controversial. In this study we 
investigated the association between compression therapy and intensive care unit 
(ICU) mortality in patients with a first acute myocardial infarction (AMI) 
diagnosis complicated with type II DM.
METHODS: This retrospective cohort study analyzed all patients with AMI and type 
II DM in the Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care-IV database. We 
extracted the demographics, vital signs, laboratory test results, comorbidities, 
and scoring system results of patients from the first 24 h after ICU admission. 
The outcomes of this study were 28-day mortality and ICU mortality. Analyses 
included Kaplan-Meier survival analysis, Cox proportional-hazards regression, 
and subgroup analysis.
RESULTS: The study included 985 eligible patients with AMI and type II DM, of 
who 293 and 692 were enrolled into the no-AE device therapy and AE device 
therapy groups, respectively. In the multivariate analysis, compared with no-AE 
device therapy, AE device therapy was a significant predictor of 28-day 
mortality (OR = 0.48, 95% CI = 0.24-0.96, P = 0.039) and ICU mortality (OR = 
0.50, 95% CI = 0.27-0.90, P = 0.021). In addition to age, gender and coronary 
artery bypass grafting surgery, there were no significant interactions of AE 
device therapy and other related risk factors with ICU mortality and 28-day 
mortality in the subgroup analysis.
CONCLUSIONS: Simple-AE-device therapy was associated with reduced risks of ICU 
mortality and 28-day mortality, as well as an improvement in the benefit on 
in-hospital survival in patients with AMI complicated with type II DM.

PURPOSE: Acute kidney injury (AKI) is a common complication of acute 
exacerbation of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (AECOPD), and inflammation 
is the potential link between AKI and AECOPD. However, little is known about the 
incidence and risk stratification of AKI in critically ill AECOPD patients. In 
this study, we aimed to establish risk model based on white blood cell 
(WBC)-related indicators to predict AKI in critically ill AECOPD patients.
MATERIAL AND METHODS: For the training cohort, data were taken from the Medical 
Information Mart for eICU Collaborative Research Database (eICU-CRD) database, 
and for the validation cohort, data were taken from the Medical Information Mart 
for Intensive Care-IV (MIMIC-IV) database. The study employed logistic 
regression analysis to identify the major predictors of WBC-related biomarkers 
on AKI prediction. Subsequently, a risk model was developed by multivariate 
logistic regression, utilizing the identified significant indicators.
RESULTS: Finally, 3551 patients were enrolled in training cohort, 926 patients 
were enrolled in validation cohort. AKI occurred in 1206 (33.4%) patients in 
training cohort and 521 (56.3%) patients in validation cohort. According to the 
multivariate logistic regression analysis, four WBC-related indicators were 
finally included in the novel risk model, and the risk model had a relatively 
good accuracy for AKI in the training set (C-index, 0.764, 95% CI 0.749-0.780) 
as well as in the validation set (C-index, 0.738, 95% CI: 0.706-0.770). Even 
after accounting for other models, the critically ill AECOPD patients in the 
high-risk group (risk score > 3.44) still showed an increased risk of AKI (odds 
ratio: 4.74, 95% CI: 4.07-5.54) compared to those in low-risk group (risk score 
≤ 3.44). Moreover, the risk model showed outstanding calibration capability as 
well as therapeutic usefulness in both groups for AKI and ICU mortality and 
in-hospital mortality of critical ill AECOPD patients.
CONCLUSION: The novel risk model showed good AKI prediction performance. This 
risk model has certain reference value for the risk stratification of AECOPD 
complicated with AKI in clinically.

BACKGROUND: Ischemic stroke (IS) and malignant tumor (MT) have high morbidity 
and mortality rates worldwide, and several associations exist between them. This 
study aimed to determine the effect of MT on hospital mortality in patients with 
IS.
METHODS: Based on their MT status, participants with IS in the Medical 
Information Mart for Intensive Care IV (MIMIC-IV) were divided into two groups. 
The primary outcome was in-hospital all causes mortality. Kaplan-Meier survival 
analysis was performed to evaluate the intergroup in-hospital mortality, and 
three Cox regression models were used to determine the association between MT 
and in-hospital mortality.
RESULTS: A total of 1605 participants (749 males and 856 females) were included 
in the study. The mean age was 72.030 ± 15.463 years. Of these, 257 (16%) 
patients died in the hospital. Kaplan-Meier analysis showed that the MT group 
had a significantly lower possibility of in-hospital survival than the non-MT 
group. In the unadjusted model, in-hospital mortality among MT patients had a 
higher odds ratio (OR) of 1.905 (95% CI, 1.320-2.748; P < 0.001) than the non-MT 
group. After adjusting for basic information, vital signs, and laboratory data, 
MT was also associated with increased in-hospital mortality (OR = 1.844, 95% CI: 
1.255-2.708; P = 0.002).
CONCLUSIONS: Among the patients with IS, the risk of all causes in-hospital 
mortality was higher for MT than for patients non-MT. This finding can assist 
clinicians in more accurately assessing prognosis and making informed treatment 
decisions.

Assessing illness severity in the intensive care unit (ICU) is crucial for early 
prediction of deterioration and prognosis. Traditional prognostic scores often 
treat organ systems separately, overlooking the body's interconnected nature. 
Network physiology offers a new approach to understanding these complex 
interactions. This study used the concept of transfer entropy (TE) to measure 
information flow between heart rate (HR), respiratory rate (RR), and capillary 
oxygen saturation ([Formula: see text]) in critically ill patients with sepsis, 
hypothesizing that TE between these signals would correlate with disease 
outcome. The retrospective cohort study utilized the Medical Information Mart 
for Intensive Care III Clinical Database, including patients who met Sepsis-3 
criteria on admission and had 30 min of continuous HR, RR, and [Formula: see 
text] data. TE between the signals was calculated to create physiological 
network maps. Cox regression assessed the relationship between cardiorespiratory 
network indices and both deterioration [Sequential Organ Failure Assessment 
(SOFA) score increase of ≥2 points at 48 h] and 30-day mortality. Among 164 
patients, higher information flow from [Formula: see text] to HR [TE ([Formula: 
see text] → HR)] and reciprocal flow between HR and RR [TE (RR → HR) and TE (HR 
→ RR)] were linked to reduced mortality, independent of age, mechanical 
ventilation, SOFA score, and comorbidity. Reductions in TE (HR → RR), TE (RR → 
HR), TE ([Formula: see text] → RR), and TE ([Formula: see text] → HR) were 
associated with an increased risk of 48-h deterioration. After adjustment for 
potential confounders, only TE (HR → RR) and TE (RR → HR) remained statistically 
significant. The study confirmed that physiological network mapping using 
routine signals in patients with sepsis could indicate illness severity and that 
higher TE values were generally associated with improved outcomes.NEW & 
NOTEWORTHY This study adopts an integrative approach through physiological 
network analysis to investigate sepsis, with the goal of identifying differences 
in information transfer between physiological signals in sepsis survivors versus 
nonsurvivors. We found that greater information flow between heart rate, 
respiratory rate, and capillary oxygen saturation was associated with reduced 
mortality, independent of age, disease severity, and comorbidities. In addition, 
reduced information transfer was linked to an increased risk of 48-h 
deterioration in patients with sepsis.

Systemic inflammation plays a crucial role in the pathogenesis and prognosis of 
diabetes and cardiovascular diseases. System inflammation response index (SIRI), 
is an emerging biomarker designed to assess the extent of systemic inflammation. 
We aimed to delineate the prognostic significance of SIRI in patients with both 
AF and type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). Utilizing the Medical Information Mart 
for Intensive Care IV (MIMIC-IV) (v2.2) repository, subjects divided into three 
groups based on the SIRI index. The primary endpoint of our study was all-cause 
mortality during hospitalization, with one-year mortality serving as the 
secondary endpoint. A cohort of 2054 AF and T2DM patients participated. COX 
regression analysis revealed elevated SIRI levels as an independent risk factor 
for both in-hospital and 1-year mortality. 192 patients died during 
hospitalization, and 265 died during the follow-up of 1 year. When treating the 
SIRI as a continuous variable, a higher SIRI was significantly associated with 
increased all-cause mortality both in-hospital [hazard ratio (HR) 1.015, 95%CI 
1.010-1.020, P = 0.015] and 1-year (HR 1. 016, 95%CI 1.008-1.015, P = 0.012). 
Additionally, compared to patients with the lowest tertiles of SIRI, those with 
the highest tertiles of SIRI possessed significantly higher all-cause mortality 
both in-hospital and 1-year after multivariable adjustment, and this 
relationship remained pronounced in AF and T2DM patients [in-hospital mortality 
(HR: 1.863, 95% CI 1.189-2.918, P = 0.007); one-year mortality (HR: 2.143, 95% 
CI 1.621-2.831, P < 0.001)]. Our RCS analyses indicated a pronounced linear 
association between SIRI and mortality in T2DM (p-value for non-linear < 0.001). 
In AF patients with T2DM, high SIRI is an independent predictor of poor survival 
and may be helpful for patient's risk stratification.

BACKGROUND: The aim of this study was to use five machine learning approaches 
and logistic regression to design and validate the acute kidney injury (AKI) 
prediction model for critically ill individuals with cardiogenic shock (CS).
METHODS: All patients who diagnosed with CS from the MIMIC-IV database, the eICU 
database, and Zhongnan hospital of Wuhan university were included in this study. 
Clinical information, including demographics, comorbidities, vital signs, 
critical illness scores and laboratory tests was retrospectively collected. Five 
machine learning algorithms (LightGBM, decision tree, XGBoost, random forest, 
and ensemble model) and one conventional logistic regression were applied for 
the prediction of AKI in critically ill individuals with CS. ROC curves were 
generated via python software to assess the overall performance of machine 
learning algorithms and the SHAP analysis was adopted to reveal the impact of 
prediction for each feature.
RESULTS: The ensemble model exhibited the best predictive ability (AUC:0.91, 95% 
CI, 0.88-0.94), followed by random forest (AUC:0.90, 95% CI, 0.86-0.94) and 
XGBoost (AUC:0.89, 95% CI, 0.84-0.92). While the logistic regression model 
obtained the worst predictive performance (AUC:0.62, 95% CI, 0.56-0.68). When 
validated the prediction models with eICU database, the ensemble model exhibited 
the best predictive ability (AUC:0.92, 95% CI, 0.89-0.96), while the logistic 
model obtained the worst predictive performance (AUC:0.61, 95% CI, 0.56-0.67). 
Finally, we verified the prediction models using the data from our hospital and 
ensemble model still exhibited the best predictive ability (AUC:0.74, 95% CI, 
0.62-0.86), while the decision tree model obtained the worst predictive 
performance (AUC:0.52, 95% CI 0.35-0.70).
CONCLUSION: Machine learning algorithms could be utilized for the AKI prediction 
among critically ill CS patients, and exhibit superior predictive performance 
compared to the conventional logistic regression analysis.

OBJECTIVE: This study aims to evaluate the association between the white blood 
cell-to-platelet ratio (WPR) and 28-day all-cause mortality among patients 
experiencing cardiac arrest.
METHODS: Utilizing data from 748 cardiac arrest patients in the Medical 
Information Mart for Intensive Care-IV (MIMIC-IV) 2.2 database, machine learning 
algorithms, including the Boruta feature selection method, random forest 
modeling, and SHAP value analysis, were applied to identify significant 
prognostic biomarkers. Key patient characteristics, encompassing demographic 
data, comorbidities, hematological and biochemical indices, and vital signs, 
were extracted using PostgreSQL Administration Tool (pgAdmin) software. The Cox 
proportional hazards model assessed the impact of WPR on mortality outcomes, 
while Kaplan-Meier survival curves and restricted cubic spline (RCS) analysis 
further validated the findings. Subgroup analyses stratified the prognostic 
value of WPR by demographic and clinical factors.
RESULTS: WPR demonstrated the highest prognostic significance among the 
variables studied, showing a strong association with 28-day all-cause mortality. 
In the unadjusted Model 1, hazard ratios (HRs) for WPR quartiles ranged from 
1.88 (95% CI: 1.22-2.90) in Q2 to 3.02 (95% CI: 2.04-4.47) in Q4 (Ptrend <0.05). 
Adjusted models (Models 2-4) confirmed the robustness of these associations, 
even after accounting for demographic and clinical covariates. Kaplan-Meier and 
RCS analyses revealed a significant U-shaped relationship between WPR and 
mortality risk. Subgroup analyses indicated that elevated WPR was particularly 
associated with increased mortality in males, elderly patients, married 
individuals, and those with chronic pulmonary disease.
CONCLUSION: WPR serves as an independent and reliable prognostic biomarker for 
28-day mortality in cardiac arrest patients. Its integration into clinical 
decision-making may enhance the early identification of high-risk patients and 
guide tailored therapeutic interventions.

OBJECTIVE: To investigate the association between the glucose-to-lymphocyte 
ratio (GLR) and prognosis of patients with sepsis-associated acute kidney injury 
(SA-AKI).
METHODS: Based on the Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care-IV (MIMIC-IV), 
SA-AKI patients aged ≥ 18 years were selected. According to the tertiles of GLR, 
the patients were divided into GLR1 group (GLR ≤ 4.97×10-9 mmol), GLR2 group 
(4.97×10-9 mmol < GLR < 9.75×10-9 mmol) and GLR3 group (GLR ≥ 9.75×10-9 mmol). 
Patients with SA-AKI were divided into survival group and death group according 
to whether they survived 28 days after admission. The patient's gender, age, 
vital signs, laboratory test results, comorbidities, sequential organ failure 
assessment (SOFA), acute physiology score III (APS III) score and treatment 
measures were extracted from the database. Kaplan-Meier survival analysis was 
used to make the survival curves of patients with SA-AKI at 28 days, 90 days, 
180 days and 1 year. Multivariate Logistic regression analysis model was used to 
explore the independent risk factors of 28-day mortality in patients with 
SA-AKI. Receiver operator characteristic curve (ROC curve) was used to analyze 
the predictive efficacy of GLR for the prognosis of patients with SA-AKI.
RESULTS: A total of 1 524 patients with SA-AKI were included, with a median age 
of 68.28 (58.96, 77.24) years old, including 612 females (40.16%) and 912 males 
(59.84%). There were 507 patients in the GLR1 group, 509 patients in the GLR2 
group and 508 patients in the GLR3 group. There were 1 181 patients in the 
28-day survival group and 343 patients in the death group. Grouping according to 
GLR tertiles showed that with the increase of GLR, the 28-day, 90-day, 180-day 
and 1-year mortality of SA-AKI patients gradually increased (28-day mortality 
were 11.64%, 22.00%, 33.86%, respectively; 90-day mortality were 15.98%, 26.72%, 
40.55%, respectively; 180-day mortality were 17.16%, 28.29% and 41.73%, and the 
1-year mortality were 17.95%, 29.27% and 42.72%, respectively, all P < 0.01). 
According to 28-day survival status, the GLR of the death group was 
significantly higher than that of the survival group [×10-9 mmol: 9.81 (5.75, 
20.01) vs. 6.44 (3.64, 10.78), P < 0.01]. Multivariate Logistic regression 
analysis showed that GLR was an independent risk factor for 28-day mortality in 
patients with SA-AKI [when GLR was used as a continuous variable: odds ratio 
(OR) = 1.065, 95% confidence interval (95%CI) was 1.045-1.085, P < 0.001; when 
GLR was used as a categorical variable, compared with GLR1 group: GLR2 group OR 
= 1.782, 95%CI was 1.200-2.647, P = 0.004; GLR3 group OR = 2.727, 95%CI was 
1.857-4.005, P < 0.001]. ROC curve analysis showed that the area under the ROC 
curve (AUC) of GLR for predicting 28-day mortality in patients with SA-AKI was 
0.674, when the optimal cut-off value was 8.769×10-9 mmol, the sensitivity was 
57.1% and the specificity was 67.1%. The predictive performance was improved 
when GLR was combined with APS III score and SOFA score, and the AUC was 0.806, 
the sensitivity was 74.6% and the specificity was 71.4%.
CONCLUSIONS: GLR is an independent risk factor of 28-day mortality in patients 
with SA-AKI, and high GLR is associated with poor prognosis in patients with 
SA-AKI.

BACKGROUND: Compared to the conventional anion gap, the albumin-corrected anion 
gap (ACAG) offers a more precise measure of acid-base imbalance, providing 
superior prognostic insight. However, the prognostic relevance of ACAG in 
individuals of atrial fibrillation (AF) remains insufficiently explored. This 
research seeks to evaluate the correlation between ACAG levels and mortality 
risk in individuals with AF.
METHODS: We identified individuals diagnosed with AF from the Medical 
Information Mart for Intensive Care (MIMIC)-IV database. Participants were 
categorized into quartiles based on their ACAG levels. The outcomes included 30 
days and 365 days all-cause mortality. Kaplan-Meier survival curves were 
utilized to evaluate cumulative survival across the ACAG quartiles. We applied 
Cox regression and restricted cubic spline regression analyses to evaluate the 
correlation between ACAG levels and prognosis. Subgroup analyses and interaction 
assessments were applied to confirm the robustness of the findings.
RESULTS: A total of 2920 AF patients (54.93% male) were incorporated into the 
analysis, with 1.61% identified as having paroxysmal AF. The 30-day and 365-day 
mortality rates were 22.91% and 39.21%, respectively. Kaplan-Meier survival 
curves demonstrated that elevated ACAG levels were significantly linked to 
increased mortality (log-rank P < 0.001). In multivariate Cox proportional 
hazards analyses, increased ACAG independently predicted mortality at both 30 
days (adjusted hazard ratio [aHR], 1.04; 95% CI, 1.02-1.05; P < 0.01) and 365 
days (aHR, 1.03; 95% CI, 1.02-1.05; P < 0.01) after adjusting for potential 
confounders. A positive relationship between rising ACAG levels and mortality 
risk was showed by restricted cubic spline analysis. Subgroup analyses revealed 
no significant interactions (all interaction P-values > 0.05).
CONCLUSIONS: In individuals with AF, higher ACAG levels are related to a greater 
mortality risk at 30 and 365 days. These findings suggest that ACAG may serve as 
a valuable prognostic marker for AF patient stratification. Incorporating ACAG 
into clinical decision-making could support improved therapeutic strategies and 
enhance patient outcomes.

PURPOSE: A retrospective analysis of critically-ill patients with hypoxic 
hepatitis (HH) to characterize the biochemical profile and to identify 
predictors of mortality using the Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care 
III database.
METHODS: HH was defined as a rapid increase in AST/ALT≥800IU/L after exclusion 
of other causes. We investigated the correlation between various clinical and 
laboratory parameters and mortality rates using regression models.
RESULTS: Among 38,645 ICU-patients, 565 (1.46%) were diagnosed with HH; 57.9% 
were males; median age was 63years. The unique biochemical profile of HH was 
confirmed; lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) was higher than both ALT and AST; AST>ALT 
for the first 2days then the ratio is reversed until recovery. All-cause 
hospital mortality was 44.1%. All-cause hospital mortality was 44.1%. On 
multivariate analysis, older age, higher SAPS-II, higher INR, higher bilirubin, 
higher LDH, acute kidney injury (AKI), and the need for vasopressors were 
independently associated with mortality.
CONCLUSION: Older age, higher SAPS-II, LDH, INR and bilirubin levels, 
concomitant AKI and the need for vasopressors were all factors associated with 
increased mortality. The diagnosis of HH was an important harbinger of mortality 
in this population, which appears to be driven mainly by the severity of the 
underlying conditions.

BACKGROUND: Acute exacerbation of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (AECOPD) 
particularly when coupled with acute respiratory failure (ARF), markedly 
elevates mortality rates. This investigation focuses on pivotal inflammatory 
markers in exacerbations of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), 
including the neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio (NLR), lactate-to-albumin ratio 
(LAR), glucose-to-lymphocyte ratio (GLR), prognostic nutritional index (PNI), 
platelet-to-lymphocyte ratio (PLR), and systemic immune-inflammation index 
(SII), which are easily determinable from peripheral blood. We aimed to 
investigate the prognostic value of NLR, LAR, GLR, SII, PNI, and PLR for 
in-hospital mortality among AECOPD patients with ARF.
METHODS: This analysis encompassed data from the Medical Information Mart for 
Intensive Care IV (MIMIC-IV) database, involving patients diagnosed with AECOPD 
and ARF. The study employed multivariate logistic regression and restricted 
cubic spline (RCS) models to evaluate the relationship between selected 
inflammatory markers and in-hospital mortality. The efficacy of these markers as 
prognostic tools was further assessed through receiver operating characteristic 
(ROC) curve analysis.
RESULTS: The study included 1,209 AECOPD patients with ARF, comprising 1,137 
survivors and 72 fatalities, yielding an in-hospital mortality rate of 5.96%. 
Both NLR and PNI demonstrated non-linear relationships with mortality outcomes 
in RCS analysis, with inflection points at 6.66 and 43.54, respectively. 
Elevated GLR were linked with increased mortality risk. These results persisted 
even after adjusting for covariates. No significant associations were found for 
SII, LAR, or PLR. Notably, NLR [area under the curve (AUC) =0.684; 95% 
confidence interval (CI): 0.627-0.741] slightly surpassed PNI (AUC =0.663; 95% 
CI: 0.557-0.691) and GLR (AUC =0.624; 95% CI: 0.557-0.691) in predictive 
accuracy.
CONCLUSIONS: NLR, GLR, and PNI on admission to hospital have moderate predictive 
utility for in-hospital mortality in patients with AECOPD and ARF. The findings 
may provide some references for exploring prognostic biomarkers and help 
clinicians to identify patients with AECOPD and ARF at elevated risk of 
mortality in an early stage.

BACKGROUND: Sepsis is a globally recognized health issue that continues to 
contribute significantly to mortality and morbidity in intensive care units 
(ICUs). The association between mean arterial pressure (MAP) and prognosis among 
patients with patients is yet to be demonstrated.
OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to explore the association between MAP and 
28-day mortality in ICU patients with sepsis using data from a large, 
multicenter database.
METHODS: This is a retrospective cohort study. We extracted data of 35,010 
patients with sepsis from the MIMIC-IV (Medical Information Mart for Intensive 
Care) database between 2008 and 2019, according to the Sepsis 3.0 diagnostic 
criteria. The MAP was calculated as the average of the highest and lowest 
readings within the first 24 hours of ICU admission, and patients were divided 
into 4 groups based on the mean MAP, using the quadruple classification 
approach. Other worst-case indications from the first 24 hours of ICU admission, 
such as vital signs, severity of illness scores, laboratory indicators, and 
therapies, were also gathered as baseline data. The independent effects of MAP 
on 28-day mortality were explored using binary logistic regression and a 
two-piecewise linear model, with MAP as the exposure and 28-day mortality as the 
outcome variables, respectively. To address the nonlinearity relationship, curve 
fitting and a threshold effect analysis were performed.
RESULTS: A total of 34,981 patients with sepsis were included in the final 
analysis, the mean age was 66.67 (SD 16.01) years, and the 28-day mortality rate 
was 16.27% (5691/34,981). The generalized additive model and smoothed curve 
fitting found a U-shaped relationship between MAP and 28-day mortality in these 
patients. The recursive algorithm determined the low and high inflection points 
as 70 mm and 82 mm Hg, respectively. Our data demonstrated that MAP was 
negatively associated with 28-day mortality in the range of 34.05 mm Hg-69.34 mm 
Hg (odds ratio [OR] 0.93, 95% CI 0.92-0.94; P<.001); however, once the MAP 
exceeded 82 mm Hg, a positive association existed between MAP and 28-day 
mortality of patients with sepsis (OR 1.01; 95% CI 1.01-1.02, P=.002).
CONCLUSIONS: There is a U-shaped association between MAP and the probability of 
28-day mortality in patients with sepsis. Both the lower and higher MAP were 
related with a higher risk of mortality in patients with sepsis. These patients 
have a decreased risk of mortality when their MAP remains between 70 and 82 mm 
Hg.

OBJECTIVE: This study aims to develop a nomogram model incorporating 
lactate-to-albumin ratio (LAR) to predict the prognosis of hospitalized patients 
with intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH) and demonstrate its excellent predictive 
performance.
METHODS: A total of 226 patients with ICH from the Medical information mart for 
intensive care III (MIMIC Ⅲ) database were randomly split into 8:2 ratio 
training and experimental groups, and 38 patients from the eICU-CRD for external 
validation. Univariate and multivariate Cox proportional hazards regression 
analysis was performed to identify independent factors associated with ICH, and 
multivariate Cox regression was used to construct nomograms for 7-day and 14-day 
overall survival (OS). The performance of nomogram was verified by the 
calibration curves, decision curves, and receiver operating characteristic (ROC) 
curves.
RESULTS: Our study identified LAR, glucose, mean blood pressure, sodium, and 
ethnicity as independent factors influencing in-hospital prognosis. The 
predictive performance of our nomogram model for predicting 7-day and 14 -day OS 
(AUCs: 0.845 and 0.830 respectively) are both superior to Oxford Acute Severity 
of Illness Score, Simplified acute physiology score II, and SIRS (AUCs: 0.617, 
0.620 and 0.591 and AUCs: 0.709, 0.715 and 0.640, respectively) in internal 
validation, and also demonstrate favorable predictive performance in external 
validation (AUCs: 0.778 and 0.778 respectively).
CONCLUSIONS: LAR as a novel biomarker is closely associated with an increased 
risk of in-hospital mortality of patients with ICH. The nomogram model 
incorporating LAR along with glucose, mean blood pressure, sodium, and ethnicity 
demonstrate excellent predictive performance for predicting the prognosis of 7- 
and 14-day OS of hospitalized patients with ICH.

INTRODUCTION: Cardiac arrest (CA), characterized by its heterogeneity, poses 
challenges in patient management. This study aimed to identify clinical 
subphenotypes in CA patients to aid in patient classification, prognosis 
assessment, and treatment decision-making.
METHODS: For this study, comprehensive data were extracted from the Medical 
Information Mart for Intensive Care IV (MIMIC-IV) 2.0 database. We excluded 
patients under 18 years old, those not initially admitted to the intensive care 
unit (ICU), or treated in the ICU for less than 72 h. A total of 57 clinical 
parameters relevant to CA patients were selected for analysis. These included 
demographic data, vital signs, and laboratory parameters. After an extensive 
literature review and expert consultations, key factors such as temperature (T), 
sodium (Na), creatinine (CR), glucose (GLU), heart rate (HR), PaO2/FiO2 ratio 
(P/F), hemoglobin (HB), mean arterial pressure (MAP), platelets (PLT), and white 
blood cell count (WBC) were identified as the most significant for cluster 
analysis. Consensus cluster analysis was utilized to examine the mean values of 
these routine clinical parameters within the first 24 h post-ICU admission to 
categorize patient classes. Furthermore, in-hospital and 28-day mortality rates 
of patients across different CA subphenotypes were assessed using multivariate 
logistic and Cox regression analysis.
RESULTS: After applying exclusion criteria, 719 CA patients were included in the 
study, with a median age of 67.22 years (IQR: 55.50-79.34), of whom 63.28% were 
male. The analysis delineated two distinct subphenotypes: Subphenotype 1 (SP1) 
and Subphenotype 2 (SP2). Compared to SP1, patients in SP2 exhibited 
significantly higher levels of P/F, HB, MAP, PLT, and Na, but lower levels of T, 
HR, GLU, WBC, and CR. SP2 patients had a notably higher in-hospital mortality 
rate compared to SP1 (53.01% for SP2 vs. 39.36% for SP1, P < 0.001). 28-day 
mortality decreased continuously for both subphenotypes, with a more rapid 
decline in SP2. These differences remained significant after adjusting for 
potential covariates (adjusted OR = 1.82, 95% CI: 1.26-2.64, P = 0.002; 
HR = 1.84, 95% CI: 1.40-2.41, P < 0.001).
CONCLUSIONS: The study successfully identified two distinct clinical 
subphenotypes of CA by analyzing routine clinical data from the first 24 h 
following ICU admission. SP1 was characterized by a lower rate of in-hospital 
and 28-day mortality when compared to SP2. This differentiation could play a 
crucial role in tailoring patient care, assessing prognosis, and guiding more 
targeted treatment strategies for CA patients.

A Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient Approach to Medication Dosing and 
Surveillance in the ICU.

Lin R, Stanley MD, Ghassemi MM, Nemati S.

Medication dosing in a critical care environment is a complex task that involves 
close monitoring of relevant physiologic and laboratory biomarkers and 
corresponding sequential adjustment of the prescribed dose. Misdosing of 
medications with narrow therapeutic windows (such as intravenous [IV] heparin) 
can result in preventable adverse events, decrease quality of care and increase 
cost. Therefore, a robust recommendation system can help clinicians by providing 
individualized dosing suggestions or corrections to existing protocols. We 
present a clinician-in-the-loop framework for adjusting IV heparin dose using 
deep reinforcement learning (RL). Our main objectives were to learn a new IV 
heparin dosing policy based on the multi-dimensional features of patients, and 
evaluate the effectiveness of the learned policy in the presence of other 
confounding factors that may contribute to heparin-related side effects. The 
data used in the experiments included 2598 intensive care patients from the 
publicly available MIMIC database and 2310 patients from the Emory University 
clinical data warehouse. Experimental results suggested that the distance from 
RL policy had a statistically significant association with anticoagulant 
complications $(p< 0.05)$, after adjusting for the effects of confounding 
factors.

BACKGROUND: Red blood cell distribution width (RDW) was a risk factor for poor 
prognosis in acute myocardial infarction (AMI). Recent reports suggested that 
combining RDW with other laboratory metrics could provide a better prediction. 
This retrospective study aimed to investigate whether the RDW-albumin ratio 
(RAR) may be associated with mortality after an AMI.
METHODS: This cohort study was conducted among adults (over 16 years old) with 
AMI in the Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care Database III V1.4 
(MIMIC-III). The primary outcome was 30-day mortality, and the secondary outcome 
was 1-year and 3-year mortality. Cox hazard regression model and Kaplan-Meier 
survival curves were constructed to estimate the effect of biomarkers on 
mortality. We used three models to adjust for potential bias. Receiver operating 
characteristic (ROC) curves and the area under the curve (AUC) were analyzed for 
the excellent performance of RAR on prognosis.
RESULTS: A total of 826 patients were eventually enrolled in our study. In 
multivariate analysis, RAR was found to be associated with 30-day mortality 
(Model 3: HR = 1.23, 95% CI = 1.09-1.39, P < .001). In addition, Subgroup 
analysis showed that the effect of RAR was higher in female patients than in 
male patients (P for interaction = .026). Kaplan-Meier survival curves showed 
that patients in the lower RAR quartile tended to have higher survival rates in 
the short and long term. AMI patients with RAR ≥ 4 had a 122% increase in 3-year 
mortality. Results of ROC and AUC showed that the prognostic performance of RAR 
for mortality was the best (30-day mortality: 0.703; 1-year mortality: 0.729; 
3-year mortality: 0.737).
CONCLUSIONS: RAR is a simple and stable predictor of prognosis in AMI patients. 
Our results support RAR = 4.0 as a criterion for prognostic risk stratification 
of AMI patients.

BACKGROUND: The development of acute kidney injury (AKI) during an intensive 
care unit (ICU) admission is associated with increased morbidity and mortality.
METHODS: Our objective was to develop and validate a data driven multivariable 
clinical predictive model for early detection of AKI among a large cohort of 
adult critical care patients. We utilized data form the Medical Information Mart 
for Intensive Care III (MIMIC-III) for all patients who had a creatinine 
measured for 3 days following ICU admission and excluded patients with 
pre-existing condition of Chronic Kidney Disease and Acute Kidney Injury on 
admission. Data extracted included patient age, gender, ethnicity, creatinine, 
other vital signs and lab values during the first day of ICU admission, whether 
the patient was mechanically ventilated during the first day of ICU admission, 
and the hourly rate of urine output during the first day of ICU admission.
RESULTS: Utilizing the demographics, the clinical data and the laboratory test 
measurements from Day 1 of ICU admission, we accurately predicted max serum 
creatinine level during Day 2 and Day 3 with a root mean square error of 
0.224 mg/dL. We demonstrated that using machine learning models (multivariate 
logistic regression, random forest and artificial neural networks) with 
demographics and physiologic features can predict AKI onset as defined by the 
current clinical guideline with a competitive AUC (mean AUC 0.783 by our 
all-feature, logistic-regression model), while previous models aimed at more 
specific patient cohorts.
CONCLUSIONS: Experimental results suggest that our model has the potential to 
assist clinicians in identifying patients at greater risk of new onset of AKI in 
critical care setting. Prospective trials with independent model training and 
external validation cohorts are needed to further evaluate the clinical utility 
of this approach and potentially instituting interventions to decrease the 
likelihood of developing AKI.

BACKGROUND: Delirium is a severe neuropsychiatric symptom following acute 
ischemic stroke (IS) and is associated with poor outcomes. Systemic inflammation 
and immune dysregulation are believed to contribute to the pathophysiology of 
delirium. The neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio (NLR), platelet-to-lymphocyte ratio 
(PLR), and lymphocyte-to-monocyte ratio (LMR) are widely recognized as 
convenient and reliable biomarkers of systemic inflammation. However, their 
association with delirium after IS remains unclear.
METHODS: In this study, we identified IS patients requiring ICU admission from 
the Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care (MIMIC)-IV database. We employed 
multivariable logistic regression and restricted cubic splines (RCS) to assess 
the association between the NLR, PLR, and LMR and delirium. Two-sample Mendelian 
randomization (MR) analysis was performed to further explore their causal 
relationship at the genetic level.
RESULTS: A total of 1,436 patients with IS were included in this study, of whom 
214 (14.9%) had delirium. In the multivariate logistic regression analysis, 
after adjustment for confounders, the patients in the highest quartile of the 
NLR (odds ratio [OR] 2.080, 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.282-3.375) and LMR 
(OR 0.503, 95% CI 0.317-0.798) and the patients in the second quartile of the 
PLR (OR 1.574, 95% CI 1.019-2.431) were significantly associated with delirium. 
The RCS function showed a progressive increase in the risk of delirium with 
higher NLR and PLR and lower LMR. In the MR analysis, only the PLR was 
negatively associated with the risk of delirium.
CONCLUSION: The observational studies found significant associations between the 
NLR, PLR, and LMR and delirium. However, the MR analysis only demonstrated a 
potential protective causal relationship between the PLR and delirium. Further 
prospective studies are needed to validate their association and to elucidate 
the underlying mechanisms.

BACKGROUND: Recent studies reported that serum anion gap could be regarded as a 
prognostic biomarker for patients admitted to intensive care units. However, the 
association between AG and mortality in cerebral infarction patients remained 
largely unknown.
METHODS: Relevant clinical data were collected from Medical Information Mart for 
Intensive Care III. Patients were divided into three groups according to 
tertiles of AG. Kaplan-Meier curve and Cox proportional hazards models were used 
to evaluate the association between AG levels and all-cause mortality. Subgroup 
analyses were performed to verify the predictive role of AG on mortality.
RESULTS: Kaplan-Meier analysis showed that patients with higher AG had shorter 
survival time. Cox regression model indicated high AG as an independent risk 
factor of 30-day, 60-day and 180-day all-cause mortality (30-day: HR = 2.45, 95% 
CI = 1.21-4.97, 60-day: HR = 2.04, 95% CI = 1.07-3.89, and 180-day: HR = 1.85, 
95% CI = 1.02-3.36). However, no significance was observed between AG and 
365-day all-cause mortality (HR = 1.56, 95% CI = 0.87-2.78).
CONCLUSIONS: High AG was associated with increased risk of all-cause mortality, 
and AG could be an independent short-term prognostic factor for cerebral 
infarction.

Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is a chronic inflammatory lung 
disease, and inflammation plays a key role in the pathogenesis of COPD. The aim 
of this study is to investigate the association between systemic immune 
inflammation index (SII), systemic inflammatory response index (SIRI),pan-immune 
inflammation value (PIV), neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio (NLR), and 
platelet-to-lymphocyte ratio (PLR) and all-cause mortality in patients with 
chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), and to evaluate the effect of 
composite inflammatory markers on the prognosis of COPD patients. We obtained 
data on COPD patients from the Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care 
(MIMIC) -IV database and divided patients into four groups based on quartiles of 
baseline levels of inflammatory markers, The primary outcomes were in-hospital 
and ICU mortality. We comprehensively explored the association between composite 
inflammatory markers and mortality in patients with COPD using restricted cubic 
splints (RCS), COX proportional hazards regression models, Kaplan-Meier curves, 
receiver operating characteristic (ROC), and subgroup analyses. A total of 1234 
COPD patients were included in this study. RCS results showed that SII, SIRI, 
PLR, PIV and NLR were positively and non-linearly correlated with the increased 
risk of in-hospital mortality in COPD patients. Multivariate COX regression 
analysis showed that compound inflammatory markers were independent risk factors 
for in-hospital mortality in COPD patients. The KM curve results showed that 
COPD patients with higher SII, SIRI, PLR and PIV had a significantly lower 
survival probability. 5 kinds of compound between inflammatory markers and 
mortality in patients with COPD is related to nonlinear correlation, can 
increase the risk of mortality in patients with COPD is a risk factor for the 
prognosis of patients with COPD, and may serve as potential biomarkers for 
clinical COPD risk stratification and treatment management in critical patients.

BACKGROUND: More than 20% of patients admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) 
develop an adverse event (AE). No previous study has leveraged patients' data to 
extract the temporal features using their structural temporal patterns, that is, 
trends.
OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to improve AE prediction methods by using structural 
temporal pattern detection that captures global and local temporal trends and to 
demonstrate these improvements in the detection of acute kidney injury (AKI).
METHODS: Using the Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care dataset, 
containing 22,542 patients, we extracted both global and local trends using 
structural pattern detection methods to predict AKI (ie, binary prediction). 
Classifiers were built on 17 input features consisting of vital signs and 
laboratory test results using state-of-the-art models; the optimal classifier 
was selected for comparisons with previous approaches. The classifier with 
structural pattern detection features was compared with two baseline classifiers 
that used different temporal feature extraction approaches commonly used in the 
literature: (1) symbolic temporal pattern detection, which is the most common 
approach for multivariate time series classification; and (2) the last recorded 
value before the prediction point, which is the most common approach to extract 
temporal data in the AKI prediction literature. Moreover, we assessed the 
individual contribution of global and local trends. Classifier performance was 
measured in terms of accuracy (primary outcome), area under the curve, and 
F-measure. For all experiments, we employed 20-fold cross-validation.
RESULTS: Random forest was the best classifier using structural temporal pattern 
detection. The accuracy of the classifier with local and global trend features 
was significantly higher than that while using symbolic temporal pattern 
detection and the last recorded value (81.3% vs 70.6% vs 58.1%; P<.001). 
Excluding local or global features reduced the accuracy to 74.4% or 78.1%, 
respectively (P<.001).
CONCLUSIONS: Classifiers using features obtained from structural temporal 
pattern detection significantly improved the prediction of AKI onset in ICU 
patients over two baselines based on common previous approaches. The proposed 
method is a generalizable approach to predict AEs in critical care that may be 
used to help clinicians intervene in a timely manner to prevent or mitigate AEs.

BACKGROUND: Sepsis is a prevalent and severe medical condition which is 
frequently observed in the intensive care unit (ICU). Although numerous 
biomarkers have been identified to predict the prognosis of sepsis, the lactate 
dehydrogenase to albumin ratio (LDH/ALB ratio) has not been extensively 
investigated. The principal objective of this study is to assess the 
relationship between LDH/ALB ratio and all-cause mortality in patients with 
sepsis.
METHODS: This study included all adult critically ill patients with sepsis from 
the Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care IV (MIMIC-IV, version 2.0) 
database. Propensity score matching (PSM) analysis was conducted to mitigate 
bias, and Kaplan-Meier curves were performed to evaluate the cumulative survival 
across different groups. The association between the LDH/ALB ratio and mortality 
was examined through restricted cubic spline (RCS) analysis and Cox regression 
analysis. The robustness of the findings was confirmed through subgroup 
analyses. Additionally, the prognostic capability of the LDH/ALB ratio was 
further evaluated using receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis.
RESULTS: There were 6059 adult patients with sepsis enrolled in the final 
analysis. RCS revealed a non-linear relationship between the LDH/ALB ratio and 
an increased risk of ICU all-cause mortality (χ2 = 46.900, P < 0.001). Following 
PSM analysis, 1553 matched pairs were obtained. As comparison to the low LDH/ALB 
ratio group, the mortality rate in the high LDH/ALB ratio group was 
significantly higher (P < 0.001). Kaplan-Meier curves, both before and after 
PSM, revealed that the ICU cumulative survival rate for patients with sepsis was 
significantly lower in the high LDH/ALB ratio group compared to the low LDH/ALB 
ratio group (χ2 = 93.360, P < 0.001; χ2 = 14.400, P < 0.001). Even after 
adjusting for a range of potential confounders, multivariate Cox regression 
analysis indicated that an elevated LDH/ALB ratio was a significant predictor of 
all-cause mortality in these patients. ROC curve analysis demonstrated that the 
LDH/ALB ratio had an area under the ROC curve (AUC) of 0.688 for predicting ICU 
mortality, with a sensitivity of 69.2% and a specificity of 58.6%.
CONCLUSIONS: An elevated LDH/ALB ratio (≥10.57) was associated with all-cause 
mortality in critically ill patients with sepsis, and it might serve as a 
prognostic marker. Clinicians should pay closer attention to sepsis patients 
presenting with an LDH/ALB ratio of 10.57 or higher.

OBJECTIVES: We tested the hypothesis that routine monitoring data could describe 
a detailed and distinct pathophysiologic phenotype of impending hypoglycemia in 
adult ICU patients.
DESIGN: Retrospective analysis leading to model development and validation.
SETTING: All ICU admissions wherein patients received insulin therapy during a 
4-year period at the University of Virginia Medical Center. Each ICU was 
equipped with continuous physiologic monitoring systems whose signals were 
archived in an electronic data warehouse along with the entire medical record.
PATIENTS: Eleven thousand eight hundred forty-seven ICU patient admissions.
INTERVENTIONS: The primary outcome was hypoglycemia, defined as any episode of 
blood glucose less than 70 mg/dL where 50% dextrose injection was administered 
within 1 hour. We used 61 physiologic markers (including vital signs, laboratory 
values, demographics, and continuous cardiorespiratory monitoring variables) to 
inform the model.
MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Our dataset consisted of 11,847 ICU patient 
admissions, 721 (6.1%) of which had one or more hypoglycemic episodes. 
Multivariable logistic regression analysis revealed a pathophysiologic signature 
of 41 independent variables that best characterized ICU hypoglycemia. The final 
model had a cross-validated area under the receiver operating characteristic 
curve of 0.83 (95% CI, 0.78-0.87) for prediction of impending ICU hypoglycemia. 
We externally validated the model in the Medical Information Mart for Intensive 
Care III critical care dataset, where it also demonstrated good performance with 
an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve of 0.79 (95% CI, 
0.77-0.81).
CONCLUSIONS: We used data from a large number of critically ill inpatients to 
develop and externally validate a predictive model of impending ICU 
hypoglycemia. Future steps include incorporating this model into a clinical 
decision support system and testing its effects in a multicenter randomized 
controlled clinical trial.

AIM: Sepsis-associated encephalopathy (SAE) is a common and serious complication 
of sepsis with poor prognosis. Statin was used in SAE patients, whereas its 
effects on these patients remain unknown. This study is aimed at investigating 
the impact of statins on the 30-day mortality of patients with SAE.
METHODS: In this retrospective cohort study, data from SAE patients were 
extracted from the Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care IV (MIMIC-IV). 
Statins include atorvastatin, pravastatin, rosuvastatin, and simvastatin. The 
outcome was 30-day mortality of SAE patients starting 24 h after the first 
intensive care unit (ICU) admission and at the first time after hospitalization. 
Potential covariates (sociodemographic characteristics, vital signs, score 
indexes, laboratory parameters, comorbidities, and treatment intervention 
methods) were selected using univariate Cox proportional hazard analysis. 
Associations between statin use and statin type and 30-day mortality were 
explored using univariate and multivariate Cox proportional hazard models with 
hazard ratios (HRs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs). Associations were 
further explored in different age groups, sex, sequential organ failure 
assessment (SOFA), simplified acute physiology score II (SAPS II), and systemic 
inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS) populations.
RESULTS: A total of 2,729 SAE patients were included in the study, and 786 
(28.8%) died within 30 days. Statin use was associated with lower odds of 30-day 
mortality (HR = 0.77, 95%CI: 0.66-0.90) in all SAE patients. Patients who took 
simvastatin treatments were associated with lower odds of 30-day mortality 
(HR = 0.58, 95%CI: 0.43-0.78). Rosuvastatin treatments had a higher 30-day 
mortality risk (HR = 1.88, 95%CI: 1.29-2.75). Statin use was also associated 
with lower 30-day mortality among patients of different ages, sex, sequential 
organ failure assessment (SOFA), SAPS II, and SIRS.
CONCLUSION: Patients who were treated with simvastatin were associated with 
lower odds of 30-day mortality in SAE patients. Caution should be paid to statin 
use in SAE patients, particularly in patients treated with rosuvastatin or 
pravastatin.

BACKGROUND: The dysregulated stress response is a key pathological mechanism 
underlying sepsis and is strongly associated with poor clinical outcomes. Stress 
hyperglycemia, a common manifestation of this response, may provide valuable 
prognostic information in sepsis patients. The stress hyperglycemia ratio (SHR) 
offers a more accurate reflection of the stress response and may be instrumental 
in assessing sepsis prognosis.
METHODS: This study aimed to investigate the relationship between SHRs and 
clinical outcomes in sepsis patients. Data were obtained from the Medical 
Information Mart for Intensive Care IV database. Demographic information, 
intensive care unit (ICU) parameters within the first 24 h, laboratory results, 
insulin administration, survival time, and outcomes were extracted for analysis. 
Four SHR metrics (SHRfirst, SHRmin, SHRmax, and SHRmean) were calculated based 
on blood glucose values during the first 24 h of ICU admission (first, minimum, 
maximum, and mean, respectively). The predictive performance of each SHR metric 
was compared using the area under the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) 
curve. Kaplan-Meier survival analysis was performed to assess survival rates 
across groups defined by ROC curve-generated cut-off values. Associations 
between SHR and 28-day as well as 1-year mortality were further examined using 
both univariate and multivariate Cox regression analyses.
RESULTS: A total of 5,025 sepsis patients were included, of whom 656 died within 
28 days of ICU admission. SHR was significantly higher in the non-survivor 
group. Among the SHR metrics, SHRmax demonstrated the highest predictive value 
for both 28-day and 1-year mortality. Higher SHR values were consistently 
associated with increased mortality (all P < 0.001). For SHRmax, each 1-unit 
increase was associated with a 77% increase in mortality in univariate analysis 
and a 71.6% increase in multivariate analysis. Sensitivity analyses indicated 
that the relationship between SHR and mortality was stronger in patients without 
diabetes.
CONCLUSIONS: SHR serves as a robust marker of the dysregulated stress response 
in sepsis and holds significant prognostic value, particularly SHRmax, in 
predicting mortality. These findings underscore the potential clinical utility 
of SHR in guiding therapeutic strategies aimed at modulating the stress response 
and blood glucose levels in critically ill sepsis patients. Further research is 
warranted to explore SHR-targeted interventions in sepsis management.

BACKGROUND: Timely and accurate prediction of short-term mortality is critical 
in intensive care units (ICUs), where patients' conditions change rapidly. 
Traditional scoring systems, such as the Simplified Acute Physiology Score and 
Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation, rely on static variables 
collected within the first 24 hours of admission and do not account for 
continuously evolving clinical states. These systems lack real-time 
adaptability, interpretability, and generalizability. With the increasing 
availability of high-frequency electronic medical record (EMR) data, machine 
learning (ML) approaches have emerged as powerful tools to model complex 
temporal patterns and support dynamic clinical decision-making. However, 
existing models are often limited by their inability to handle irregular 
sampling and missing values, and many lack rigorous external validation across 
institutions.
OBJECTIVE: We aimed to develop a real-time, interpretable risk prediction model 
that continuously assesses ICU patient mortality using irregular, longitudinal 
EMR data, with improved performance and generalizability over traditional static 
scoring systems.
METHODS: A time-aware bidirectional attention-based long short-term memory 
(TBAL) model was developed using EMR data from the MIMIC-IV (Medical Information 
Mart for Intensive Care) and eICU Collaborative Research Database (eICU-CRD) 
databases, comprising 176,344 ICU stays. The model incorporated dynamic 
variables, including vital signs, laboratory results, and medication data, 
updated hourly, to perform static and continuous mortality risk assessments. 
External cross-validation and subgroup sensitivity analyses were conducted to 
evaluate robustness and fairness. Model performance was assessed using the area 
under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUROC), area under the 
precision-recall curve (AUPRC), accuracy, and F1-score. Interpretability was 
enhanced using integrated gradients to identify key predictors.
RESULTS: For the static 12-hour to 1-day mortality prediction task, the TBAL 
model achieved AUROCs of 95.9 (95% CI 94.2-97.5) and 93.3 (95% CI 91.5-95.3) and 
AUPRCs of 48.5 and 21.6 in MIMIC-IV and eICU-CRD, respectively. Accuracy and 
F1-scores reached 94.1 and 46.7 in MIMIC-IV and 92.2 and 28.1 in eICU-CRD. In 
dynamic prediction tasks, AUROCs reached 93.6 (95% CI 93.2-93.9) and 91.9 (95% 
CI 91.6-92.1), with AUPRCs of 41.3 and 50, respectively. The model maintained 
high recall for positive cases (82.6% and 79.1% in MIMIC-IV and eICU-CRD). 
Cross-database validation yielded AUROCs of 81.3 and 76.1, confirming 
generalizability. Subgroup analysis showed stable performance across age, sex, 
and severity strata, with top predictors including lactate, vasopressor use, and 
Glasgow Coma Scale score.
CONCLUSIONS: The TBAL model offers a robust, interpretable, and generalizable 
solution for dynamic real-time mortality risk prediction in ICU patients. Its 
ability to adapt to irregular temporal patterns and to provide hourly updated 
predictions positions it as a promising decision-support tool. Future work 
should validate its utility in prospective clinical trials and investigate its 
integration into real-world ICU workflows to enhance patient outcomes.

An EEMD-PCA approach to extract heart rate, respiratory rate and respiratory 
activity from PPG signal.

Motin MA, Karmakar CK, Palaniswami M.

The pulse oximeter's photoplethysmographic (PPG) signals, measure the local 
variations of blood volume in tissues, reflecting the peripheral pulse modulated 
by cardiac activity, respiration and other physiological effects. Therefore, PPG 
can be used to extract the vital cardiorespiratory signals like heart rate (HR), 
respiratory rate (RR) and respiratory activity (RA) and this will reduce the 
number of sensors connected to the patient's body for recording vital signs. In 
this paper, we propose an algorithm based on ensemble empirical mode 
decomposition with principal component analysis (EEMD-PCA) as a novel approach 
to estimate HR, RR and RA simultaneously from PPG signal. To examine the 
performance of the proposed algorithm, we used 45 epochs of PPG, 
electrocardiogram (ECG) and respiratory signal extracted from the MIMIC database 
(Physionet ATM data bank). The ECG and capnograph based respiratory signal were 
used as the ground truth and several metrics such as magnitude squared coherence 
(MSC), correlation coefficients (CC) and root mean square (RMS) error were used 
to compare the performance of EEMD-PCA algorithm with most of the existing 
methods in the literature. Results of EEMD-PCA based extraction of HR, RR and RA 
from PPG signal showed that the median RMS error (quartiles) obtained for RR was 
0 (0, 0.89) breaths/min, for HR was 0.62 (0.56, 0.66) beats/min and for RA the 
average value of MSC and CC was 0.95 and 0.89 respectively. These results 
illustrated that the proposed EEMD-PCA approach is more accurate in estimating 
HR, RR and RA than other existing methods.

Sepsis is well known with high mortality, and there is a need for early 
recognition of septic patients with poor prognosis. The purpose of this study is 
to evaluate the association between lactate dehydrogenase to albumin ratio (LAR) 
and the short-term mortality in sepsis. Septic patients were selected from 
Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care IV database. The primary and 
secondary outcomes were 28-day and 90-day all-cause mortality. Cox regression 
analysis, Kaplan-Meier survival curves, restricted cubic spline and subgroup and 
sensitivity analyses were performed to explore the relationship between LAR and 
mortality. The study included 5784 patients with sepsis. Kaplan-Meier analysis 
showed that patients with higher LAR exhibited lower 28-day and 90-day survival 
rates. There existed a linear relationship between log2 transformed LAR and 
28-day and 90-day mortality. Multivariable Cox regression analysis revealed a 
positive relationship between log2-LAR and 28-day mortality risk (HR, 1.36; 95% 
CI, 1.29-1.42; P < .001). Patients in the second and third tertile groups had 
higher risk for 28-day mortality (HR = 1.46, 95% CI = 1.26-1.70, and HR = 2.14, 
95% CI = 1.85-2.49, respectively; P for trend < .001), compared to first tertile 
group. Similar results were found for 90-day mortality. Subgroup and sensitivity 
analyses revealed consistent results. High LAR was independently associated with 
an increased risk of 28-day and 90-day all-cause mortality in patients with 
sepsis. LAR was suggested to be a promising biomarker for early identification 
of septic patients at higher risk of short-term mortality.

PURPOSE: Hemoglobin (Hb) levels and red cell distribution width (RDW) are 
standard and widely used parameters that predict clinical outcomes in patients 
with chronic heart failure (CHF). The Hb to RDW ratio (HRR) provides an 
incremental clinical prediction, as it reflects the various clinical 
characteristics of patients. No published data exists in the Medical Information 
Mart for Intensive Care (MIMIC-IV) and eICU Collaborative Research Database 
(eICU-CRD) databases on HRR and its association with in-hospital mortality among 
patients with CHF. The aim of this study was to evaluate the relationship 
between the HRR and in-hospital mortality in two large real-world cohorts of 
patients with chronic CHF.
PATIENTS AND METHODS: Data from the MIMIC-IV and eICU-CRD databases were used to 
explore the association between HRR and in-hospital mortality. 
Multivariate logistic regression, stratified analysis with interaction, and 
restricted cubic splines were used to investigate the association between 
HRR and in-hospital mortality.
RESULTS:  A total of 30,411 patients with CHF were enrolled based on the 
MIMIC-IV and multicenter eICU-CRD databases (15,983 and 14,428, respectively), 
including 16,295 men and 14,116 women with a median age of 73 years. The mean 
HRR was 0.69 ± 0.20. The overall in-hospital mortality rate was 12.63%. 
Increasing quantiles of HRR were associated with reduced in-hospital mortality 
rates. After adjusting for significant predictors, multivariate logistic 
regression analysis demonstrated that a low HRR was a significant predictor of 
in-hospital mortality, with a graded reduction in risk as HRR increased. 
Sensitivity analysis using restricted cubic splines demonstrated a continuous 
increase in in-hospital mortality risk with decreasing HRR (P = 0.262 for the 
non-linear model).
CONCLUSION: A linear relationship was observed between baseline HRR levels and 
in-hospital mortality. Lower HRR levels were associated with higher in-hospital 
mortality in patients with CHF. HRR could be a reliable clinical metric for 
assessing in-hospital mortality risk.

BACKGROUND: To develop an inflammatory biomarker-based, simple-to-use nomogram 
for the early identification of septic patients at high risk of mortality in the 
emergency department (ED).
METHODS: All patients diagnosed with sepsis admitted to the intensive care unit 
(ICU) from the ED were screened from the Medical Information Mart for Intensive 
Care III database and divided into two cohorts: the primary cohort and the 
validation cohort. We used bivariate logistic regression analysis to determine 
independent risk factors and to construct a predictive nomogram and subsequently 
evaluated the calibration, discrimination and clinical usefulness of the 
nomogram. The gradient boosting machine (GBM) model was used to more accurately 
evaluate these variables.
RESULTS: A total of 5663 admissions were enrolled, of which 3964 comprised the 
primary cohort and 1699 comprised the validation group, with 28-day mortality 
rates of 21.2% and 20.4%, respectively. Age > 69, neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio 
(NLR) > 9.8, platelet-to-lymphocyte ratio (PLR) > 249.89, lymphocyte-to-monocyte 
ratio (LMR) ≤ 2.18, and red cell distribution width (RDW) were detected as 
important determinants of 28-day mortality and included in the nomogram. The 
calibration plot revealed an adequate fit of the nomogram for predicting the 
risk of 28-day mortality. Regarding discriminative ability, receiver operating 
characteristic curve analysis showed that the nomogram had an area under the 
curve (AUC) of 0.826 (95% CI: 0.811-0.841, P < 0.001) in the primary cohort, 
which was greater than that of all individual parameters and other scores. 
Decision curve analysis also indicated that our nomogram was feasible in 
clinical practice, as the threshold probabilities were 0-0.62 for the primary 
cohort. The GBM model yielded a significantly greater AUC of up to 0.867.
CONCLUSIONS: This proposed simple-to-use nomogram based on age, NLR, PLR, LMR 
and RDW provides a relatively accurate mortality prediction for septic patients 
in the ED.

OBJECTIVE: Red blood cell distribution width (RDW) is a predictor of adverse 
outcomes in aortic aneurysms. Recent recommendations suggest that combining RDW 
with other biomarkers could yield better results. We, therefore, propose 
evaluating the biomarker of vascular aging, albumin with RDW to predict the risk 
of aortic aneurysms. This study aims to explore whether the combination of RDW 
with albumin can effectively predict the prognosis of aortic aneurysm patients.
METHODS: This retrospective cohort study was conducted among adults (age >18) 
with aortic aneurysms in the Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care 
Database III V1.4 (MIMIC-III). RAR was measured according to the red blood cell 
distribution width and albumin. The primary outcome was the 30-day mortality 
rate, and the secondary outcome was the 90-day and one-year mortality rates. 
Estimation of hazard ratios (HR) was obtained from Cox regression models for 
all-cause mortality related to red cell distribution width-to-albumin ratio 
(RAR) values.
RESULTS: In total, 312 patients were involved, with an average age of 74.9 ± 
10.9 years and an average RAR value of 5.4 ± 1.6 mL/g. In 30 days for all-cause 
mortality, the HR (95% CI) in the highest RAR group (>5.8 mL/g) in tertiles was 
2.54 (1.25, 5.14) in the unadjusted model, with a significant difference 
compared with the reference group (P < 0.05). After adjusting for race, gender 
and age, there was still a correlation (P < 0.05), and the HR (95% CI) was 2.51 
(1.23, 5.10). Further adjustment of possible covariates showed similar 
correlation in model 3 (P < 0.05), and HR (95% CI) was 2.66 (1.17, 6.01). 
Multivariable logistic regression shows that RAR is an independent risk factor 
for the outcome of aortic aneurysms after adjusting the covariates. In the 
subgroup analysis, we analyzed the patient's complications, and no significant 
interaction was observed.
CONCLUSION: RAR is a risk factor for patients with aortic aneurysms. However, 
more in-depth research is warranted to further analyze and substantiate our 
findings on the role of RAR in aortic aneurysm patients.

BACKGROUND Inflammation plays an important part in the pathogenesis of 
cardiogenic shock (CGS). Whether the neutrophil-lymphocyte ratio (NLR), an 
integrated biomarker of inflammation, is associated with the outcome of CGS 
patients remains unknown. This retrospective cohort study was performed to 
identify the utility of using NLR among patients with CGS. MATERIAL AND METHODS 
Data were extracted from the MIMIC database. We applied smooth curve fitting to 
define the NLR cutoff values. The primary outcome was 30-day mortality. Cox 
proportional hazards models, subgroup analysis, and receiver operator 
characteristic (ROC) curve analysis were performed. RESULTS A total of 1470 CGS 
patients were extracted, among which 801 (54.5%) were men. The mean age of the 
population was 70.37 years. An inverse U-shaped relationship was observed 
between NLR and mortality in CGS patients, with the highest risk being at values 
ranging from 9.4 to 15. For the primary outcome of 30-day mortality, the 
adjusted HR (95% CI) values of the middle tertile (NLR 9.4-15) and the upper 
tertile (NLR >15) were 1.47 (1.14, 1.88) and 1.22 (0.94, 1.57) compared with the 
reference of lower tertile (NLR <9.4). ROC curve analysis showed that NLR had a 
more sensitive prognostic value in predicting 30-day mortality of CGS than the 
neutrophil or lymphocyte percentage alone (0.660 vs. 0.540, 0.549). CONCLUSIONS 
An inverse U-shaped curve was presented between NLR and the mortality of CGS. 
NLR seemed to be a readily available and independent prognostic biomarker for 
patients with CGS. The prognostic value of NLR was more sensitive than the 
neutrophil or lymphocyte percentage alone, but not as good as SOFA or SAPSII 
score.

OBJECTIVE: To further improve the department information system, and to 
establish a multi-parameter critical care medicine database, which can provide 
data for the analysis and research of big data in critical care medicine, and 
provide references for other medical institutions to establish relevant 
databases.
METHODS: On the premise of fully understanding the needs of clinical and 
scientific research, based on a Critical Care Medicine Clinical Information 
System, the department of critical care medicine of the First Medical Center of 
Chinese PLA General Hospital integrated the patients' case data in hospital 
information system (HIS), electronic medical records (EMR), monitoring 
information system (Monitor), laboratory information system (LIS), and radiation 
information system (RIS), to establish a rudimentary critical care database. On 
this basis, the related data were analyzed and verified. Further, this database 
was gradually improved in both its content and structure by referring to Medical 
Information Mart for Intensive Care III (MIMIC-III) database.
RESULTS: During the operation of Critical Care Medicine Clinical Information 
System from September 2017 to February 2020, the database collected diagnosis 
and treatment data of 2 207 critically ill patients, including data before the 
patient entering the intensive care unit (ICU) and all data during the ICU, such 
as demographic data, vital signs, medical treatment, the records of intake and 
output, sampling time, laboratory examination results, surgical treatment, and a 
variety of commonly used clinical scoring and diagnosis data. The data in the 
database were stored in different tables according to different contents, and 
the tables were connected to each other through the primary key. The data could 
be analyzed statistically through the information system and has been applied 
for certain clinical studies, combining clinical practices with scientific 
studies.
CONCLUSIONS: The critical care medicine database based on the Critical Care 
Medicine Clinical Information System can help medical institutions to carry out 
standardized treatment and clinical research of critically ill patients. With 
further improvement of the function, the database can be better applied to the 
data analysis of Chinese critical patients.

OBJECTIVE: To investigate the association between early central venous pressure 
(CVP) measurement and mortality in patients with sepsis.
METHODS: The adult patients with sepsis were identified from the health data of 
Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care-III v1.4 (MIMIC-III v1.4). Data of 
all adult patients with sepsis were collected, including gender, age, 
comorbidities, length of survival, total length of hospital stay and intensive 
care unit (ICU) stay, sequential organ failure assessment (SOFA) score, vital 
signs, laboratory test results on the first day, vasoactive agents usage, fluid 
input, urine output and fluid balance on the first day, need for renal 
replacement therapy and mechanical ventilation, diagnosis of sepsis, and the 
time and value of the first CVP measurement in the ICU. Patients were divided 
into early measurement and control groups based on whether or not they had a CVP 
measurement within the first 6 hours of ICU stay. According to the time of the 
first CVP measurement, the patients were subdivided into four subgroups: ≤ 3 
hours, 4-6 hours, 7-12 hours and no measurement within 12 hours. The primary 
endpoint was 28-day mortality. The relationship between initial CVP and 
mortality was analyzed by Lowess smoothing method. Kaplan-Meier survival 
analysis and Log-Rank test were performed for univariate analysis. Cox 
regression analysis was performed for multivariate analysis to estimate the 
relationship between timeliness of CVP measurement and mortality.
RESULTS: A total of 4 733 sepsis patients were enrolled, 1 673 of whom had CVP 
measured within 6 hours of admission to the ICU, and the other 3 060 patients 
served as the control group. There were no differences in demographic 
characteristics and underlying diseases between the two groups, except that the 
early CVP measurement group had less underlying renal failure compared with 
control group. The early CVP measurement group had higher lactic acid (Lac) 
levels and SOFA scores, indicating worse severity of disease as compared with 
control group. The 28-day mortality in the early CVP measurement group was 
significantly lower than that in the control group (34.2% vs. 40.7%, P < 0.01). 
The early CVP measurement group had shorter length of total hospitalization and 
longer length of ICU stay, higher rate of mechanical ventilation and vasoactive 
agents dependent, and more fluid input and fluid balanced in the first day of 
ICU stay compared with control group. Lowess smoothing analysis showed that a 
"U"-shaped relationship between initial CVP and mortality was identified, 
suggesting that too high or too low initial CVP was associated with worse 
survival. Kaplan-Meier survival analysis showed that compared with the patients 
without early CVP measurement within 12 hours, the cumulative survival rate of 
patients with CVP measured within 3 hours was significantly higher (66.7% vs. 
59.1%; Log-Rank test: χ2 = 15.810, adjusted P < 0.001); while no significant 
difference was found in patients with CVP measured between 4 hours and 6 hours 
and between 7 hours and 12 hours compared with the patients without early CVP 
measurement within 12 hours (64.4%, 60.3% vs. 59.1%; Log-Rank test: χ2 values 
were 5.630 and 0.100, and adjusted P values were 0.053 and > 0.999, 
respectively). Cox multivariate analysis showed that the Cox proportional risk 
model was established by taking patients without CVP measurement within 12 hours 
as reference, timely CVP measurement after ICU admission was associated with 
reduced 28-day mortality of patients with sepsis [≤ 3 hours: hazard ratio (HR) = 
0.65, 95% confidence interval (95%CI) was 0.55-0.77, P < 0.001; 4-6 hours: HR = 
0.72, 95%CI was 0.60-0.87, P = 0.001; 7-12 hours: HR = 0.80, 95%CI was 
0.66-0.98, P = 0.032] after the confounding variables (gender, age, SOFA score, 
initial Lac, renal failure, maximal blood glucose and white blood cell count, 
and minimal platelet count within 24 hours) were adjusted.
CONCLUSIONS: Early CVP measurement is associated with decreased 28-day mortality 
in patients with sepsis. CVP should be considered as a valuable and easily 
accessible safety parameter during early fluid resuscitation.

INTRODUCTION: Hospital readmissions often result from a combination of factors, 
including inadequate follow-up care, poor discharge planning, patient 
non-adherence, and social determinants of health (SDOH) that impact access to 
healthcare and follow-up resources, many of which are beyond provider control. 
Enhanced post-discharge strategies, including risk stratification, are 
essential. This study aims to develop and validate the Discharge Severity Index 
(DSI) to predict readmission risk and optimize resource allocation for effective 
follow-up care.
METHODS: This single-center retrospective study analyzed ED visits from the 
Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care IV, dividing the data into 
derivation (75 %) and validation (25 %) cohorts. Univariate analyses were 
conducted on factors commonly available for most discharges, including patient 
age, the latest vital signs recorded, medical complexity, and ED length of stay 
(LOS). Multiple logistic regression (MLR) was employed to identify independent 
risk factors of patients revisiting the ED within a week and being subsequently 
admitted to the hospital. Adjusted parameter estimates from the MLR were used to 
develop a predictive model.
RESULTS: Among 229,920 patients discharged from the ED, 1.92 % were readmitted. 
The analysis identified seven variables correlated with this outcome, with six 
significant risk factors pinpointed through MLR: age above 65, heart rate over 
100, and oxygen saturation below 96 % (assigned 1 point each), along with having 
more than five active medications administered during the hospital stay or a LOS 
exceeding 3 h (assigned 2 points each). Using these scores, we categorized 
patients into five DSI groups, reflecting escalating readmission risk from DSI 5 
(lowest risk) to DSI 1 (highest risk): DSI 5 (0; OR: 1.0), DSI 4 (1-2; OR: 
3.49), DSI 3 (3-4; OR: 8.44), DSI 2 (5-6; OR: 11.65), and DSI 1 (>6; OR: 14.63). 
The seven-day readmission rates were comparable between the development and 
validation cohorts. For instance, for DSI 1, the rates were 5.16 % in the 
development cohort and 4.67 % in the validation cohort. For DSI 2, the rates 
were 4.16 % and 4.04 %, respectively.
CONCLUSION: This study seeks to develop and validate the DSI, proposing its 
effectiveness as a tool for healthcare providers to categorize patients by their 
risk of post-discharge admission from the ED. The utilization of this tool has 
the potential to lead to a more informed allocation of resources after 
discharge.

BACKGROUND: Ischemic stroke is a major contributor to global morbidity and 
mortality, particularly in critically ill patients in intensive care units 
(ICUs). While advances in stroke management have improved outcomes, predicting 
mortality remains challenging due to the involvement of complex metabolic and 
cardiovascular factors. The triglyceride-glucose (TyG) index, a marker for 
insulin resistance, has gained attention for its potential to predict adverse 
outcomes in stroke patients. Furthermore, the TyG-BMI index, which combines TyG 
with body mass index (BMI), may offer a more comprehensive measure by accounting 
for obesity-related metabolic burden. However, the comparative impact of these 
indices on short- and long-term mortality among critically ill ischemic stroke 
patients remains unclear.
METHODS: This retrospective cohort study analyzed data from the Medical 
Information Mart for Intensive Care IV (MIMIC-IV 3.0) database, including 1,334 
critically ill ischemic stroke patients. The patients were divided into four 
groups based on TyG and TyG-BMI quartiles, respectively. Cox proportional 
hazards models were employed to assess the association of these indices with 
30-day, 90-day, 180-day, and 1-year all-cause mortality (ACM). Kaplan-Meier 
survival analysis was used to compare survival rates across different index 
levels. We utilized restricted cubic splines (RCS) to examine the association 
between the TyG, TyG-BMI index and the specified outcomes. Furthermore, TyG and 
TyG-BMI index were utilized to establish logistic regression models for 
mortality across different time periods, and corresponding Receiver Operating 
Characteristic (ROC) curves were generated.
RESULTS: Kaplan-Meier survival analysis show that Higher TyG levels were 
associated with significantly increased mortality risk at all time points, with 
patients in the highest TyG quartile exhibiting the greatest risk. Conversely, 
patients having a lower TyG-BMI level faced a heightened risk of long-term ACM. 
The RCS analysis results demonstrated that the TyG index did not exhibit a 
statistically significant nonlinear relationship with mortality across all time 
points. However, a significant nonlinear relationship was observed between the 
TyG index and long-term mortality. From the ROC curve, it can be observed that 
TyG performs better in predicting short-term mortality. Conversely, TyG-BMI 
demonstrates superior performance in predicting long-term mortality. The 
analysis revealed that while the TyG index alone is a strong predictor of 
mortality, the TyG-BMI index enhances the ability to predict long-term outcomes.
CONCLUSION: This finding suggests both the TyG and TyG-BMI indices serve as 
valuable predictors of mortality in critically ill ischemic stroke patients. 
However, significant differences were observed across the various follow-up 
periods. Based on the distinct characteristics of these two indicators, future 
research should focus on the selective integration of TyG and TyG-BMI indices 
into clinical risk assessment models, tailored to the metabolic profiles of 
ischemic stroke patients in the ICU. This approach could enhance the precision 
of mortality risk stratification and optimize patient management strategies.

OBJECTIVE: To explore the optimal pulse oxygen saturation (SpO2) range during 
hospitalization for patients with sepsis.
METHODS: A case-control study design was employed. Demographic information, 
vital signs, comorbidities, laboratory parameters, critical illness scores, 
clinical treatment information, and clinical outcomes of sepsis patients were 
extracted from the Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care- IV (MIMIC- IV). 
A generalized additive model (GAM) combined with a Loess smoothing function was 
employed to analyze and visualize the nonlinear relationship between SpO2 levels 
during hospitalization and in-hospital all-cause mortality. The optimal range of 
SpO2 was determined, and Logistic regression model along with Kaplan-Meier curve 
were utilized to validate the association between the determined range of SpO2 
and in-hospital all-cause mortality.
RESULTS: A total of 5 937 patients met the inclusion criteria, among whom 1 191 
(20.1%) died during hospitalization. GAM analysis revealed a nonlinear and 
U-shaped relationship between SpO2 levels and in-hospital all-cause mortality 
among sepsis patients during hospitalization. Multivariable Logistic regression 
analysis further confirmed that patients with SpO2 levels between 0.96 and 0.98 
during hospitalization had a decreased mortality compared to those with SpO2 < 
0.96 [hypoxia group; odds ratio (OR) = 2.659, 95% confidence interval (95%CI) 
was 2.190-3.229, P < 0.001] and SpO2 > 0.98 (hyperoxia group; OR = 1.594, 95%CI 
was 1.337-1.900, P < 0.001). Kaplan-Meier survival curve showed that patients 
with SpO2 between 0.96 and 0.98 during hospitalization had a higher probability 
of survival than those patient with SpO2 < 0.96 and SpO2 > 0.98 (Log-Rank test: 
χ 2 = 113.400, P < 0.001). Sensitivity analyses demonstrated that, with the 
exception of subgroups with smaller sample sizes, across the strata of age, 
gender, body mass index (BMI), admission type, race, heart rate, systolic blood 
pressure, diastolic blood pressure, mean arterial pressure, respiratory rate, 
body temperature, myocardial infarction, congestive heart failure, 
cerebrovascular disease, chronic liver disease, diabetes mellitus, sequential 
organ failure assessment (SOFA), simplified acute physiology score II (SAPS II), 
systemic inflammatory response syndrome score (SIRS), and Glasgow coma score 
(GCS), the mortality of patients with SpO2 between 0.96 and 0.98 was 
significantly lower than those of patients with SpO2 < 0.96 and SpO2 > 0.98.
CONCLUSIONS: During hospitalization, the level of SpO2 among sepsis patients 
exhibits a U-shaped relationship with in-hospital all-cause mortality, 
indicating that heightened and diminished oxygen levels are both associated with 
increased mortality risk. The optimal SpO2 range is determined to be between 
0.96 and 0.98.

University, Beijing, China.

BACKGROUND: Sepsis-associated liver injury (SALI) is a critical component of 
sepsis-induced multiple organ dysfunction with high mortality. Identifying 
biomarkers for risk stratification is essential. Red cell distribution width 
(RDW), indicating variation in red blood cell volume, has been linked to adverse 
outcomes in various diseases. This study aimed to evaluate the association 
between RDW and 30-day mortality in SALI patients.
METHODS: A retrospective cohort study was conducted using data from the Medical 
Information Mart for Intensive Care-IV database. Patients admitted to the 
intensive care unit (ICU) with SALI were included. RDW was recorded within the 
initial 24 h. The primary outcome was 30-day mortality. A multivariable Cox 
regression analysis was performed to examine the relationship between RDW and 
mortality.
RESULTS: Among 529 SALI patients (mean age 68.7 years, 61.8% male), 46.1% had 
RDW > 15.5%. The 30-day mortality rate was 35.5%. RDW was significantly higher 
in non-survivors compared to survivors (17.2 ± 3.0 vs. 15.4 ± 2.3, P < 0.001). 
Cox regression identified RDW as an independent risk factor for 30-day mortality 
(HR 1.14, 95% CI 1.09 to 1.19, P < 0.001). Subgroup analyses demonstrated that 
the findings were consistent across the various groups.
CONCLUSION: Elevated RDW is independently associated with higher 30-day 
mortality in patients with SALI, suggesting its potential role in risk 
stratification and clinical management.

Background: This study aimed to develop and validate a straightforward clinical 
risk model utilizing white blood cell (WBC) counts to predict acute kidney 
injury (AKI) in critically sick patients with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). 
Methods: Data were taken from the Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care-IV 
(MIMIC-IV) database for the training cohort. Data for an internal validation 
cohort were obtained from the eICU Collaborative Research Database (eICU-CRD), 
while patients from our hospital were utilized for external validation. A risk 
model was created utilizing significant indicators identified through 
multivariate logistic regression, following logistic regression analysis to 
determine the primary predictors of WBC-related biomarkers for AKI prediction. 
The Kaplan-Meier curve was employed to evaluate the prognostic efficacy of the 
new risk model. Results: A total of 1628 critically sick HCC patients were 
enrolled. Among these, 23 (23.2%) patients at our hospital, 84 (17.9%) patients 
in the eICU-CRD database, and 379 (35.8%) patients in the MIMIC-IV database 
developed AKI. A unique risk model was developed based on leukocyte-related 
indicators following the multivariate logistic regression analysis, 
incorporating white blood cell to neutrophil ratio (WNR), white blood cell to 
monocyte ratio (WMR), white blood cell to hemoglobin ratio (WHR), and platelet 
to lymphocyte ratio (PLR). This risk model exhibited robust predictive 
capability for AKI, in-hospital mortality, and ICU mortality across the training 
set, internal validation set, and external validation set. Conclusion: This risk 
model seems to have practical consequences as an innovative and accessible tool 
for forecasting the prognosis of critically ill HCC patients, which may, to some 
degree, aid in identifying equitable risk assessments and treatment strategies.

OBJECTIVE: To investigate the correlation of hemoglobin (Hb) level with 
prognosis of elderly patients diagnosed as sepsis.
METHODS: A retrospective cohort study was conducted. Information on the cases of 
elderly patients with sepsis in the Medical Information Mart for Intensive 
Care-IV (MIMIC-IV), including basic information, blood pressure, routine blood 
test results [the Hb level of a patient was defined as his/her maximum Hb level 
from 6 hours before admission to intensive care unit (ICU) and 24 hours after 
admission to ICU], blood biochemical indexes, coagulation function, vital signs, 
severity score and outcome indicators were extracted. The curves of Hb level vs. 
28-day mortality risk were developed by using the restricted cubic spline model 
based on the Cox regression analysis. The patients were divided into four groups 
(Hb < 100 g/L, 100 g/L ≤ Hb < 130 g/L, 130 g/L ≤ Hb < 150 g/L, Hb ≥ 150 g/L 
groups) based on these curves. The outcome indicators of patients in each group 
were analyzed, and the 28-day Kaplan-Meier survival curve was drawn. Logistic 
regression model and Cox regression model were used to analyze the relationship 
between Hb level and 28-day mortality risk in different groups.
RESULTS: A total of 7 473 elderly patients with sepsis were included. There was 
a "U" curve relationship between Hb levels within 24 hours after ICU admission 
and the risk of 28-day mortality in patients with sepsis. The patients with 100 
g/L ≤ Hb < 130 g/L had a lower risk of 28-day mortality. When Hb level was less 
than 100 g/L, the risk of death decreased gradually with the increase of Hb 
level. When Hb level was ≥ 130 g/L, the risk of death gradually increased with 
the increase of Hb level. Multivariate Logistic regression analysis revealed 
that the mortality risks of patients with Hb < 100 g/L [odds ratio (OR) = 1.44, 
95% confidence interval (95%CI) was 1.23-1.70, P < 0.001] and Hb ≥ 150 g/L (OR = 
1.77, 95%CI was 1.26-2.49, P = 0.001) increased significantly in the model 
involving all confounding factors; the mortality risks of patients with 130 g/L 
≤ Hb < 150 g/L increased, while the difference was not statistically significant 
(OR = 1.21, 95%CI was 0.99-1.48, P = 0.057). The multivariate Cox regression 
analysis suggested that the mortality risks of patients with Hb < 100 g/L 
[hazard ratio (HR) = 1.27, 95%CI was 1.12-1.44, P < 0.001] and Hb ≥ 150 g/L (HR 
= 1.49, 95%CI was 1.16-1.93, P = 0.002) increased significantly in the model 
involving all confounding factors; the mortality risks of patients with 130 g/L 
≤ Hb < 150 g/L increased, while the difference was not statistically significant 
(HR = 1.17, 95%CI was 0.99-1.37, P = 0.053). Kaplan-Meier survival curve showed 
that the 28-day survival rate of elderly septic patients in 100 g/L ≤ Hb < 130 
g/L group was significantly higher than that in Hb < 100 g/L, 130 g/L ≤ Hb < 150 
g/L and Hb ≥ 150 g/L groups (85.26% vs. 77.33%, 79.81%, 74.33%; Log-Rank test: 
χ2 = 71.850, P < 0.001).
CONCLUSIONS: Elderly patients with sepsis exhibited low mortality risk if their 
100 g/L ≤ Hb < 130 g/L within 24 hours after admission to ICU, and both higher 
and lower Hb levels led to increased mortality risks.

BACKGROUND: Respiratory rate (RR) is one important vital sign that is often 
neglected in patients with acute myocardial infarction (AMI). The present study 
aimed to evaluate the impact of admission RR on the prognosis in patients with 
AMI.
METHODS: This study included 5631 AMI patients from Medical Information Mart for 
Intensive Care IV (MIMIC-IV) and 1323 patients from The First Affiliated 
Hospital of Chongqing Medical University (validation cohort). The primary 
endpoint was 30-day all-cause mortality. Patients were divided into increased RR 
group (RR > 20 breaths/min) and normal RR group (RR ≤ 20 breaths/min) based on 
admission RR.
RESULTS: In the MIMIC-IV cohort, the median age was 70 years and 3503 (62.2%) 
patients were male. Compared to patients with normal RR, patients with admission 
RR > 20 breaths/min had significantly increased risk of 30-day all-cause 
mortality (14.2% vs. 27.5%, p < 0.001). After multivariate adjustment, admission 
RR > 20 breaths/min was independently associated with increased risk of 30-day 
all-cause mortality (HR 1.715; 95%CI 1.507-1.952, p < 0.001). The findings from 
MIMIC-IV were validated in the data from The First Affiliated Hospital of 
Chongqing Medical University and the results were consistent.
CONCLUSION: RR is not only a vital sign but also a simple and practical 
indicator for predicting the prognosis of patients with AMI. Increased RR upon 
admission independently predicted a higher risk of poor outcomes, making it a 
valuable tool for early risk stratification and guiding timely interventions.

Consider that inflammatory factors are associated with short-term mortality in 
patients with acute myocardial infarction (AMI). In this retrospective analysis 
of 2,784 AMI patients from the Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care-IV 
database, we evaluated the impact of inflammatory markers on in-hospital 
mortality and predicted 30-day and 90-day outcomes. Patients were divided into 
groups based on in-hospital survival (n = 2,364) and mortality (n = 420). 
Analysis of initial hospital admission laboratory data, including inflammatory 
factors, revealed these factors as independent predictors of in-hospital 
mortality (Q4 of RDW: OR 1.96, NLR: OR 1.63, SII: OR 1.85, and SIRI: OR 2.23, 
all P < 0.05). Cox proportional hazards models confirmed their significance for 
predicting 30-day (Q4 of NLR: OR 1.83, SII: OR 1.86, and SIRI: OR 2.01, all P < 
0.05) and 90-day mortality (Q4 of RDW: OR 1.46, NLR: OR 1.69, SII: OR 1.73, and 
SIRI: OR 1.72, all P < 0.05). Increasing levels of inflammatory markers 
correlated with higher odds and hazard ratios, as illustrated by Restricted 
Cubic Spline curves. Kaplan-Meier survival analysis showed better survival rates 
with lower inflammatory marker levels. Receiver operating characteristic curves 
demonstrated good predictive performance of individual inflammatory factors, 
with a new composite marker showing the highest predictive ability (AUC = 
0.720). This study underscores the association of inflammatory factors with both 
hospital and short-term mortality in AMI patients.

OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to investigate the potential correlation between the 
neutrophil percentage to serum albumin ratio(NPAR) and in-hospital mortality in 
critically ill patients with Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD).
PATIENTS AND METHODS: This study employed a retrospective cohort design. A total 
of 599 COPD patients were included in this research. Clinical data from the 
MIMIC-IV (Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care IV) database were 
utilized. To determine whether a correlation exists between NPAR and in-hospital 
mortality, a multivariable logistic regression analysis was conducted. Subgroup 
analyses were performed, taking into account factors such as age, sex, diabetes, 
congestive heart failure, and ventilator use.
RESULTS: Among the 599 patients studied, 114 (19.0%) experienced in-hospital 
mortality. In the multivariable logistic regression model, NPAR was positively 
correlated with in-hospital mortality; for each unit increase in NPAR, the 
in-hospital mortality rate increased by 5% (Odds Ratio [OR] = 1.05; 95% 
Confidence Interval [95% CI] = 1.02-1.09). Compared to the lowest NPAR group, 
the highest NPAR group had a significantly greater risk of in-hospital mortality 
(OR [95% CI] = 2.15 [1.11-4.17]). Furthermore, the results of the subgroup 
analyses were consistent across all groups.
CONCLUSION: Our study reveals a correlation between NPAR levels and mortality in 
COPD patients. Further research is warranted to validate these findings.

OBJECTIVE: To explore the risk factors affecting the prognosis of patients with 
sepsis complicated with acute pulmonary embolism, and to construct and validate 
a nomogram predictive model for in-hospital mortality risk.
METHODS: Based on the American Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care 
(MIMIC-III, MIMIC-IV) databases, the data were collected on patients with sepsis 
complicated with acute pulmonary embolism from 2001 to 2019, including baseline 
characteristics, and vital signs, disease scores, laboratory tests within 24 
hours of admission to the intensive care unit (ICU), and interventions. 
In-hospital mortality was the outcome event. The total samples were divided into 
training and testing sets in a 7:3 ratio by random sampling. Univariate Cox 
regression analysis was used to verify the impact of all variables on the risk 
of in-hospital mortality, thereby screen potential influencing factors. 
Subsequently, a stepwise bi-directional regression method was applied to select 
factors one by one, leading to the construction of a nomogram prediction model. 
Collinearity testing was used to demonstrate the absence of strong 
multicollinearity among the influencing factors in the nomogram prediction 
model. The discrimination of the nomogram model, sequential organ failure 
assessment (SOFA), and simplified pulmonary embolism severity index (sPESI) was 
evaluated using C-index in the test set. Receiver operator characteristic curve 
(ROC curve) was drawn to evaluate the predictive value of various models for 
in-hospital mortality in patients with sepsis complicated with acute pulmonary 
embolism.
RESULTS: A total of 562 patients with sepsis complicated with acute pulmonary 
embolism were included, including 393 in the training set and 169 in the testing 
set. Univariate Cox regression analysis showed that 30 factors associated with 
in-hospital mortality in patients with sepsis complicated with acute pulmonary 
embolism. Through stepwise bi-directional regression, 12 variables were 
ultimately selected, including gender, presence of malignant tumors, body 
temperature, red cell distribution width (RDW), blood urea nitrogen (BUN), serum 
potassium, prothrombin time (PT), 24-hour urine output, mechanical ventilation, 
vasoactive drugs, warfarin use, and sepsis-induced coagulopathy (SIC). 
Collinearity testing indicated no strong multicollinearity among the influencing 
factors [all variance inflation factor (VIF) > 10]. A nomogram model was 
constructed using the 12 variables mentioned above. The nomogram model predicted 
the C-index and its 95% confidence interval (95%CI) of in-hospital mortality in 
patients with sepsis complicated with acute pulmonary embolism better than SOFA 
score and sPESI [0.771 (0.725-0.816) vs. 0.579 (0.519-0.639), 0.608 
(0.554-0.663)]. The ROC curve showed that the area under the curve (AUC) and its 
95%CI of the nomogram model were higher than those of the SOFA score and sPESI 
[0.811 (0.766-0.857) vs. 0.630 (0.568-0.691), 0.623 (0.566-0.680)]. These 
findings were consistently replicated in the internal validation of the testing 
set. In both the training and testing sets, Delong's test showed that the AUC of 
the nomogram model was significantly higher than the SOFA score and sPESI (both 
P < 0.05).
CONCLUSION: The nomogram model demonstrated good predictive effectiveness for 
the risk of in-hospital mortality in patients with sepsis complicated with acute

A robust medical monitoring device should be able to provide intelligent 
diagnosis based on accurate analysis of physiological parameters in real-time. 
At the same time, such device must be able to adapt to the characteristics of a 
specific patient and desired diagnostic needs, and continue to operate even in 
presence of unexpected artifacts and accidental errors. A reconfigurable 
architecture is proposed for real-time assessment of individual's health status 
based on development of a patient-specific health index and online analysis and 
fusion of multi-parameter physiological signals. This is achieved by static 
configuration of processing elements and communication blocks in the 
architecture based on the patient's diagnostic needs. The proposed architecture 
is prototyped as a single integrated device on an FPGA platform and is evaluated 
using multi-parameter data from intensive care units (ICUs). Three 
representative test cases of concurrently analyzing Blood Pressure, Heart Rate, 
and Electrocardiogram (ECG) data from MIMIC database are presented. The results 
show the effectiveness of the proposed technique in eliminating false alarms 
caused by patient movements, monitor noise, or imperfections in the detection 
schemes.

Early Prediction of Sepsis in EMR Records Using Traditional ML Techniques and 
Deep Learning LSTM Networks.

Saqib M, Sha Y, Wang MD.

Sepsis is a life-threatening condition caused by infection and subsequent 
overreaction by the immune system. Physicians effectively treat sepsis with 
early administration of antibiotics. However, excessive use of antibiotics on 
false positive cases cultivates antibiotic resistant bacterial strains and can 
waste resources while false negative cases result in unacceptable mortality 
rates. Accurate early prediction ensures correct, early antibiotic treatment; 
unfortunately, prediction remains daunting due to error-ridden electronic 
medical records (EMRs) and the inherent complexity of sepsis. We aimed to 
predict sepsis using only the first 24 and 36 hours of lab results and vital 
signs for a patient. We used the Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care III 
(MIMIC3) dataset to test machine learning (ML) techniques including traditional 
methods (i.e., random forest (RF) and logistic regression (LR)) as well as deep 
learning techniques (i.e., long short-term memory (LSTM) neural networks). We 
successfully created a data pipeline to process and clean data, identified 
important predictive features using RF and LR techniques, and trained LSTM 
networks. We found that our best performing traditional classifier, RF, had an 
Area Under the Curve (AUC-ROC) score of 0.696, and our LSTM networks did not 
outperform RF.

BACKGROUND: Inflammation plays a pivotal role in the progression of coronary 
artery disease and increases the risk of mortality in patients undergoing 
coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG). The glucose-to-lymphocyte ratio (GLR), 
calculated from serum glucose levels and peripheral lymphocyte counts, is a 
novel marker of inflammation, but its relationship with outcomes after CABG 
remains unexplored. The aim of this study was to evaluate the association 
between GLR and long-term mortality.
METHODS: This retrospective cohort study used data from the Medical Information 
Mart for Intensive Care (MIMIC) database to examine baseline and outcome data 
for CABG patients. Participants were stratified into quartiles based on GLR 
levels, and the Cox proportional hazards model and restricted cubic spline 
analysis were used to evaluate the association between GLR and mortality.
RESULTS: A total of 592 adult patients (mean age 70.0 ± 10.3 years, mean BMI 
30.6 ± 6.8 kg/m2) were included. After multivariable adjustment, patients in the 
highest quartile of GLR had a hazard ratio (HR) of 3.3 (95% CI: 1.04-10.49; Q4 
vs. Q2), while those in the lowest quartile had a HR of 5.62 (95% CI: 
1.71-18.48; Q1 vs. Q2). A U-shaped relationship was observed between GLR and 
risk of death (P for nonlinearity < 0.05), with sensitivity and subgroup 
analyses supporting these findings.
CONCLUSIONS: GLR was significantly associated with an increased risk of 
long-term mortality, with both the highest and lowest quartiles demonstrating 
elevated hazard ratios compared to the second quartile. Assessing GLR may have 
clinical relevance for predicting mortality risk, providing valuable insights 
for preventive strategies and patient management.

BACKGROUND: Delirium frequently occurs in individuals with acute kidney injury 
(AKI), leading to serious adverse outcomes. However, there are currently no 
predictors of early intervention for delirium in clinical practice. This study 
aims to investigate whether a correlation exists between TyG indices and the 
clinical symptoms of delirium in patients with AKI.
METHODS: Eligible participants diagnosed with AKI from the Medical Information 
Mart for Intensive Care-IV (MIMIC-IV) database were categorised based on their 
TyG index. The primary outcome of this study was the incidence of delirium. The 
TyG indices were quartile and Kaplan-Meier (K-M) cumulative curve was conducted 
to compare the consequence of each group. Cox proportional hazards and 
restricted cubic spline (RCS) analyses were employed to explore the associations 
between TyG indices and outcomes. To mitigate potential biases, a no-replacement 
propensity score matching (PSM) approach was employed. Subgroup analyses were 
conducted to explore differences across various demographic and clinical 
categories.
RESULTS: A positive correlation between the quartile groupings of TyG-AVG and an 
increased cumulative incidence of delirium in individuals with severe AKI, as 
demonstrated through K-M cumulative curves and Cox regression analysis. 
Regarding the TyG index, patients in the 4th group displayed the highest hazard 
of delirium in both of the methods mentioned above. Furthermore, RCS analysis 
indicated that the interaction between the two variables is approximately 
linear. Subgroup analyses revealed that the effects of both metrics remained 
consistent across most examined subgroups.
CONCLUSION: Higher TyG indices were clearly associated with the incidence of 
delirium in patients with severe AKI. These indices could serve as valuable 
tools for identifying delirium-prone individuals with AKI.

AIMS: There has been a lack of research examining the relationship between red 
cell distribution width (RDW) and the prognosis of cardiac arrest (CA) patients. 
The prognostic value of the changes in RDW during intensive care unit (ICU) 
hospitalization for CA patients has not been investigated. This study aims to 
investigate the correlation between RDW measures at ICU admission and RDW 
changes during ICU hospitalization and the prognosis of CA patients and then 
develop a nomogram that predicts the risk of mortality of these patients.
METHODS AND RESULTS: A retrospective cohort study is used to collect clinical 
characteristics of CA patients (>18 years) that are on their first admission to 
ICU with RDW data measured from the Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care 
IV Version 2.0 database. Patients are randomly divided into a development cohort 
(75%) and a validation cohort (25%). The primary outcome is 30 and 360 day 
all-cause mortality. ΔRDW is defined as the RDW on ICU discharge minus RDW on 
ICU admission. A multivariate Cox regression model is applied to test whether 
the RDW represents an independent risk factor that affects the all-cause 
mortality of these patients. Meanwhile, the dose-response relationship between 
the RDW and the mortality is described by restricted cubic spine (RCS). A 
prediction model is constructed using a nomogram, which is then assessed using 
receiver operating characteristic curves, calibration curves, and decision curve 
analysis (DCA). A total of 1278 adult CA patients are included in this study. We 
found that non-survivors have a higher level of RDW and ΔRDW compared with 
survivors, and the mortality rate is higher in the high RDW group than in the 
normal RDW group. The Kaplan-Meier survival curve indicates that patients in the 
normal RDW group had a higher cumulative survival rate at 30 and 360 days than 
those in the high RDW group (log-rank test, χ2  = 36.710, χ2  = 54.960, both P 
values <0.05). The multivariate Cox regression analysis shows that elevated RDW 
at ICU admission (>15.50%) is an independent predictor of 30 [hazard 
ratio = 1.451, 95% confidence interval (CI) = 1.181-1.782, P < 0.001] and 
360 day (hazard ratio = 1.393, 95% CI = 1.160-1.671, P < 0.001) all-cause 
mortality among CA patients, and an increase in RDW during ICU hospitalization 
(ΔRDW ≥ 0.4%) can serve as an independent predictor of mortality among these 
patients. A non-linear relationship between the RDW measured at ICU admission 
and the increased risk of mortality rate of these patients is shown by the RCS. 
This study established and validated a nomogram based on six variables, anion 
gap, first-day Sequential Organ Failure Assessment score, cerebrovascular 
disease, malignant tumour, norepinephrine use, and RDW, to predict mortality 
risk in CA patients. The consistency indices of 30 and 360 day mortality of CA 
patients in the validation cohort are 0.721 and 0.725, respectively. The 
nomogram proved to be well calibrated in the validation cohort. DCA curves 
indicated that the nomogram provided a higher net benefit over a wide, 
reasonable range of threshold probabilities for predicting mortality in CA 
patients and could be adapted for clinical decision-making.
CONCLUSIONS: Elevated RDW levels on ICU admission and rising RDW during ICU 
hospitalization are powerful predictors of all-cause mortality for CA patients 
at 30 and 360 days, and they can be used as potential clinical biomarkers to 
predict the bad prognosis of these patients. The newly developed nomogram, which 
includes RDW, demonstrates high efficacy in predicting the mortality of CA 
patients.

OBJECTIVE: To construct and validate the best predictive model for 28-day death 
risk in patients with septic shock based on different supervised machine 
learning algorithms.
METHODS: The patients with septic shock meeting the Sepsis-3 criteria were 
selected from Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care-IV v2.0 (MIMIC-IV 
v2.0). According to the principle of random allocation, 70% of these patients 
were used as the training set, and 30% as the validation set. Relevant 
predictive variables were extracted from three aspects: demographic 
characteristics and basic vital signs, serum indicators within 24 hours of 
intensive care unit (ICU) admission and complications possibly affecting 
indicators, functional scoring and advanced life support. The predictive 
efficacy of models constructed using five mainstream machine learning algorithms 
including decision tree classification and regression tree (CART), random forest 
(RF), support vector machine (SVM), linear regression (LR), and super learner 
[SL; combined CART, RF and extreme gradient boosting (XGBoost)] for 28-day death 
in patients with septic shock was compared, and the best algorithm model was 
selected. The optimal predictive variables were determined by intersecting the 
results from LASSO regression, RF, and XGBoost algorithms, and a predictive 
model was constructed. The predictive efficacy of the model was validated by 
drawing receiver operator characteristic curve (ROC curve), the accuracy of the 
model was assessed using calibration curves, and the practicality of the model 
was verified through decision curve analysis (DCA).
RESULTS: A total of 3 295 patients with septic shock were included, with 2 164 
surviving and 1 131 dying within 28 days, resulting in a mortality of 34.32%. Of 
these, 2 307 were in the training set (with 792 deaths within 28 days, a 
mortality of 34.33%), and 988 in the validation set (with 339 deaths within 28 
days, a mortality of 34.31%). Five machine learning models were established 
based on the training set data. After including variables at three aspects, the 
area under the ROC curve (AUC) of RF, SVM, and LR machine learning algorithm 
models for predicting 28-day death in septic shock patients in the validation 
set was 0.823 [95% confidence interval (95%CI) was 0.795-0.849], 0.823 (95%CI 
was 0.796-0.849), and 0.810 (95%CI was 0.782-0.838), respectively, which were 
higher than that of the CART algorithm model (AUC = 0.750, 95%CI was 
0.717-0.782) and SL algorithm model (AUC = 0.756, 95%CI was 0.724-0.789). Thus 
above three algorithm models were determined to be the best algorithm models. 
After integrating variables from three aspects, 16 optimal predictive variables 
were identified through intersection by LASSO regression, RF, and XGBoost 
algorithms, including the highest pH value, the highest albumin (Alb), the 
highest body temperature, the lowest lactic acid (Lac), the highest Lac, the 
highest serum creatinine (SCr), the highest Ca2+, the lowest hemoglobin (Hb), 
the lowest white blood cell count (WBC), age, simplified acute physiology score 
III (SAPS III), the highest WBC, acute physiology score III (APS III), the 
lowest Na+, body mass index (BMI), and the shortest activated partial 
thromboplastin time (APTT) within 24 hours of ICU admission. ROC curve analysis 
showed that the Logistic regression model constructed with above 16 optimal 
predictive variables was the best predictive model, with an AUC of 0.806 (95%CI 
was 0.778-0.835) in the validation set. The calibration curve and DCA curve 
showed that this model had high accuracy and the highest net benefit could reach 
0.3, which was significantly outperforming traditional models based on single 
functional score [APS III score, SAPS III score, and sequential organ failure 
assessment (SOFA) score] with AUC (95%CI) of 0.746 (0.715-0.778), 0.765 
(0.734-0.796), and 0.625 (0.589-0.661), respectively.
CONCLUSIONS: The Logistic regression model, constructed using 16 optimal 
predictive variables including pH value, Alb, body temperature, Lac, SCr, Ca2+, 
Hb, WBC, SAPS III score, APS III score, Na+, BMI, and APTT, is identified as the 
best predictive model for the 28-day death risk in patients with septic shock. 
Its performance is stable, with high discriminative ability and accuracy.

OBJECTIVE: Heart failure (HF) is a chronic progressive syndrome caused by a 
variety of cardiovascular diseases and is associated with high morbidity, 
mortality, and healthcare burden. Forecasting the prognosis of HF patients at an 
early stage is important. Therefore, our objective was to explore the 
relationship between HF patients' prognosis and the albumin-bilirubin (ALBI) 
grade.
METHODS: Data for the study were obtained from the MIMIC database. Patients with 
ALBI grade 1 were matched to patients with ALBI grades 2 and 3 using propensity 
score matching (PSM). Post-matching analyses were performed using Cox 
proportional hazards models, Kaplan-Meier survival analysis, restricted cubic 
splines (RCS), and subgroup analyses.
RESULTS: RCS analyses revealed a nonlinear relationship between ALBI grade and 
30-, 90-, and 360-day mortality in patients with HF, with a threshold value 
identified at -1.92. When ALBI scores were below - 1.92, the risk of mortality 
in HF patients remained relatively stable. In contrast, as ALBI scores 
approached and exceeded - 1.92, the mortality risk increased rapidly. Before 
PSM, both ALBI grades 2 and 3 were independent predictors of mortality in 
patients with HF; however, after PSM, ALBI grade 2 was not statistically 
associated with patient mortality. This result was supported by Kaplan-Meier 
(K-M) analysis.
